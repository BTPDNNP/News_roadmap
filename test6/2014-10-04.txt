Why Indians Are investing in US Property MarketYou are here: Home Your Money
Indians Join Wave of Foreign Investors in Condos and Homes in the U.S.
Dionne Searcey, The New York Times | Updated On: October 02, 2014 19:57 (IST)
RBI Issues Clarification on Credit Cards
Arun Kumar owns three apartments in New Delhi, where he has carved out a comfortable life as part of India's rapidly expanding middle class. Not long ago, he also became a global landlord, picking up an inexpensive three-bedroom house and a duplex nearly 8,000 miles away, in St. Louis.
For Kumar and other affluent Indians, U.S. real estate is a security blanket. Faced with what some have considered a bubble in real estate prices in major Indian cities and a sometimes jittery Bombay Stock Exchange, they are joining a wave of buyers from other countries who see the recovering U.S. housing market as one of the best places to put their money these days.
The wealthy elite from China, Latin America and elsewhere have bought pieds-a-terre in glassy towers in Manhattan, luxury condos in Miami and homes along the West Coast. Law enforcement investigations have found that some foreign investors are using U.S. real estate holdings, at least in part, to hide cash and other assets from authorities in their home country.
But many less-than-superrich foreign investors just want a safe place to put extra savings, and their investments tend to be much less grandiose than the trophy properties that have drawn most of the attention. And for Indians in particular, who long trusted in gold to protect their wealth, U.S. real estate offers a "very, very attractive destination," said Subir Gokarn, director of research at Brookings India in New Delhi.
Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia, an online marketplace for residential real estate, said the most popular property searches for people from India were in and around Silicon Valley, where technology firms heavily recruit from India; in the Boston and Philadelphia areas near universities that have numerous students from India; and in suburban areas of New Jersey and in Queens, where there are established Indian-American communities.
In an echo of the late 1980s, foreign investment in U.S. real estate has taken off again. A survey from the National Association of Realtors estimates that from April 2013 to March of this year, total sales to international clients were about $92.2 billion, a 35 percent increase over the previous 12 months. The figure includes purchases by recent immigrants.
Foreign buyers now make up 7 percent of total existing-home sales of $1.2 trillion, according to the survey. Of those, Indians represent 6 percent of the purchases, spending $5.8 billion, up from $3.9 billion over the same period a year ago and on par with buyers from Britain.
Canadians have long bought U.S. property and still do so in big numbers, with purchases centered for the most part in Arizona, Florida and more recently in Las Vegas. Canada still accounts for the largest share of buyers, but China is the fastest-growing source of clients, according to the Realtors' group.
And Chinese buyers are bigger spenders. Their real estate purchases in the United States nearly doubled from last April to last March, increasing to $22 billion from the previous period. They accounted for nearly a quarter of all international sales in the current period.
"Most people who can come here, they are pretty wealthy," said Grace Tian, a broker with Realty Mark Associates in Philadelphia who often works with Chinese clients.
In contrast, buyers from India are a more eclectic group. These include parents living in India who buy apartments for students attending college, making sure the units have concierge service and an extra bedroom so they can visit for extended periods, several real estate agents said. After the students leave college, the parents often keep the apartment and rent it out.
"It's a good investment in their eyes, and it can be a better deal instead of them paying dorm costs or renting somewhere else," said Michael DiMella, a managing partner with the Charlesgate Realty Group in Boston whose Indian clients have bought near Northeastern University.
Irene Barnaby, a broker with Weichert Realtors in Jersey City, said her Indian clients generally spent about $600,000 to $800,000 on condos. Some buyers pay cash because traditional banks won't give them mortgages without a credit history in the United States. But she has also created relationships with smaller banks that will lend money to her clientele.
"They can get exactly what they want in this area," Barnaby said.
Padmanabhan Palani, president of the condo association board at the 443-unit James Monroe tower, said the area is comfortable for many people just arriving from India or elsewhere in Asia because it resembles the high-rise districts of Mumbai and Hong Kong. Plus, he said, his building is close to the train station.
"In a snowstorm, 100 meters is very important in how far you walk," said Palani, who came to the United States 12 years ago on a work visa for a technology job and is now a permanent resident.
Some U.S.-based brokers are capitalizing on the growing interest from Indians.
Myron Von Raesfeld, a real estate agent in the heart of Silicon Valley, said his firm started working with technology companies in 1999 to offer seminars teaching immigrants with H-1B work visas the intricacies of the U.S. real estate market.
He now offers the seminar at 80 companies, in part to keep ahead of the competition. "Realtors are becoming very astute at this foreign wave," he said.
Indian real estate agents are also getting in on the action. Vikram Somani, owner of Property Hunters in Mumbai, has turned to the U.S. market, noting that title insurance is available and the buying process is far more organized.
Rohit Prakash, president of American Full House in Austin, Texas, is recruiting brokers like Somani to round up Indian clients. His firm, created four years ago, arranges limited liability partnerships helping his clients overcome tax issues and red tape that otherwise would apply to foreign investors.
"There's a sexiness to say I own property in the U.S., a little bit of bragging rights," Prakash said. "But for them to know how to go about how to do this, they were clueless."
One of his clients is Kumar, who bought his St. Louis properties sight unseen, spending about $100,000 for a three-bedroom single-family home and a two-unit house.
So far the investment hasn't been as good as Kumar had hoped. One of the units sat empty for longer than expected, and a roof had a problem that needed to be fixed.
"I'm hopeful this year it will be better," said Kumar, who is considering buying property in Silicon Valley in the future. "In any case, I was looking at investment in the USA for the long term."

United Breweries Can t Appoint Independent Director at USLYou are here: Home Corporates
Diageo Bars United Breweries from Appointing Independent Director at United Spirits
Reuters | Updated On: October 02, 2014 15:54 (IST)
AirAsia's Month-End Sale Offers Up To 60% Off
Mumbai:
Britain's Diageo PLC said India's United Breweries Holdings Ltd can no longer appoint an independent director to the board of United Spirits Ltd (USL) after reducing its ownership of the South Asian distillery.
Diageo nearly doubled its stake in USL following a $1.9 billion bid earlier this year, giving it the right to appoint the majority of directors to USL's board.
The London-listed beverage maker in a statement on Wednesday said Vijay Mallya, who controls United Breweries, will continue to serve as non-executive director and chairman of USL for as long as United Breweries owns at least 1.3 million USL shares.
A spokesperson for United Breweries declined to comment.
Mallya previously controlled USL through United Breweries, but he had to lower his stake because of heavy debt brought about by the collapse of his Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.
Diageo also said Mallya's position on USL's board will be contingent upon the "absence of certain defaults" by either Mallya or United Breweries. Diageo did not specify how it classified defaults.
Mallya was declared a "wilful defaulter" last month by state-run lender United Bank of India. In India, that means he could be forced to stand down from any corporate posts and may limit the fundraising prospects of his businesses.

The scale and persistence of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have taken many by surprise.  Gideon Rachman is joined by David Pilling, Asia editor, and Tom Mitchell, Beijing correspondent, to discuss the crisis and China's response.

How much lower can the euro goHow much lower can the euro go? Oct 02, 2014 - 12:57 pm
With the single currency already below the levels many had forecast for the end of the year, Delphine Strauss, currencies correspondent, asks Peter Kinsella, strategist at Commerzbank, whether the ECB will try to engineer a bigger depreciation. Also, will the dollar rally maintain its momentum, and can New Zealand's central bank continue to talk down the kiwi.

JPMorgan hack exposed data of 83 mln, among biggest breaches in history
Names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of the holders of some 83 million households and small business accounts were exposed when computer systems at JPMorgan Chase & Co were recently compromised by hackers, making it one of the biggest data breaches in history.
Chase relies on customers using online banking to save them money , yet they can't secure their systems with all their financial resources.

It added that it has not seen "unusual customer fraud" related to the attack which exposed contact information for 76 million households and 7 million small businesses.
The people affected are mostly account holders, but may also include former account holders and others who entered their contact information at the bank's online and mobile sites, according to a bank spokeswoman.
Security experts outside of the bank warned that the breach could result in an increase in crime as scammers will likely attempt to use the stolen information to engage in various types of fraud.
The bank's customers should be on heightened alert for fraud, said Mark Rasch, a former federal cyber crimes prosecutor.
"All of this data is useful to hackers and identity thieves," he said. "The kind of information that was stolen is not sensitive itself, but is frequently used to validate people's identities."
Tal Klein, vice president with the cybersecurity firm Adallom, said that the breach could undermine confidence in the security of banks and other companies that people assume are well protected from hackers.
"Criminals could literally take on the identities of these 83 million businesses and people. That's the biggest concern," he said.
"Until now the assumption has been that the companies that get breached are the ones that have poor security practices, but we know that JPMorgan had a good security program and that they invest heavily in this area," he said. "So what we are waking up to is that the fundamental nature of security is broken."
Still, JPMorgan advised customers on its website that it does not believe they need to change their passwords or account information.
Company spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said that the bank is not offering credit monitoring to its customers because no financial information, account data or personally identifiable information was compromised.
At the end of August, JPMorgan said it was working with U.S. law enforcement authorities to investigate a possible cyber attack. As with home break-ins, it can take victims of data attacks months to discover what, if anything, is missing.

IMF Worried About Sustained Slow Global Growth
Agence France Presse | Updated On: October 02, 2014 22:08 (IST)
Regulators Fine Global Banks $3.4 Billion in Forex Probe
Washington: IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned Thursday that the global economy could be sinking into a prolonged period of "mediocre" growth which could endanger efforts to bring down unemployment worldwide.
Ms Lagarde said that the world's economy has weakened in the past six months, despite the efforts of leading central banks to boost activity with ultra-low interest rates.
And she warned that the Ukraine crisis, the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and Middle East turmoil posed additional threats to the world's economy.
Without more active stimulus from governments themselves, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund said, there is "the risk that the world could get stuck for some time with a 'mediocre' level of growth."
That imperils efforts to bring down the number of unemployed worldwide, some 200 million people, including 75 million youth.
"Six years after the financial crisis began, we see continued weakness in the global economy. Countries are still dealing with the legacies of the crisis, including high debt burdens and unemployment," she said in a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, according to the prepared text.
"If people expect growth potential to be lower tomorrow, they will cut back on investment and consumption today.
"This dynamic could seriously impede the recovery, especially in advanced economies that are also grappling with high unemployment and low inflation. This is the case for the euro area."
Ms Lagarde said the IMF is forecasting "only a modest pickup" for next year, and that governments need to do more, with better-targeted spending and "growth-friendly" reforms.
In addition, more public investment in infrastructure would improve economies, acting as "a powerful impetus for growth and jobs."
"The world needs to aim higher and try harder, to do it together," she said.

Aviation PSUs to Fill Top Posts
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 03, 2014 14:43 (IST)
Arcil Cuts Bad Loan Purchase Target by 30 Per Cent to Rs 3,500 Crore
New Delhi:
Two major aviation PSUs - Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Pawan Hans Helicopters Limited, which were headless for several months, would soon have their top posts filled, with the Public Enterprises Selection Board(PESB) shortlisting candidates for the two positions.
While R K Srivastava, a 1984 batch IAS officer of Jharkhand cadre, has been selected from 10 candidates as Chairman AAI by PESB, the name of Dr B P Sharma, Executive Director at AAI who is currently the Kolkata Airport Director, has been shortlisted out of 12 candidates to be the CMD of Pawan Hans, official sources said.
The two names would now be sent to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for final approval, they said.
While Pawan Hans has been without a full-time CMD for about two years, AAI is being headed by Sudhir Raheja, Member (Planning) of AAI Board, an acting Chairman since January.
Air India too has remained practically headless since the incumbent, Rohit Nandan, was granted three month's extension for his successor to be chosen, after his three-year term ended in August. His extended term now ends in mid-November.
The Civil Aviation Ministry had earlier sought a two-year extension for the 1982 batch IAS officer of UP cadre, but the Appointments Committee extended it by three months.
The Ministry has again suggested a 12-month extension for Nandan on the grounds that a top-level change in the ailing national carrier at this juncture could derail it from the gradual turnaround path which was being successfully led by him.
The Star Alliance, which Air India joined in July, has also written to the Ministry to consider an extension to him for the sake of continuity of the integration process between the Indian carrier and the global airlines' grouping.
However, the sources said Nandan could be granted another extension as the last date for submitting the application for the post of CMD Air India is October 28 and the process of short-listing and interviews would begin after that.
It was not likely that the PESB would be able to complete the process of shortlisting a new CMD before November when Nandan's current term expires, the sources said.

New York Has World s Largest Billionaire PopulationRegulators Fine Global Banks $3.4 Billion in Forex Probe
A new study of the super-rich finds that New York more billionaires than any other city. A study done by the wealth research and consulting firm Wealth-X and UBS says New York had 103 billionaires.
It is followed by Moscow, at 85; Hong Kong at 82; London at 72; and Beijing at 37.
Mumbai, with 28, occupies that 11th spot in the list of top 20 billionaire cities. In total, the study said there are 100 billionaires in India with their combined wealth pegged at $175 billion.
Eight of the top 20 global billionaire cities are located in Asia, "a further indication that Asia is at the beginning of a new cycle in wealth creation," the study said. "And only two of the top 20 cities are located in the United States, despite it being the single largest billionaire country. "
Billionaires choose their residences and business holdings not just because of government regulations, but also because of the unique benefits that a specific location can offer, the study said.
The study cited New York's role as the financial capital of the world as helping the city attract new billionaire financiers. "In addition, certain cities are particularly attractive because of the lifestyle they offer, from cultural attractions to a desirable environment in which to raise a family," the study added.

For some Hong Kong residents  patience with protests wears thinFor some Hong Kong residents  patience with protests wears thin
Get ready for the selfie of the future  photography posing as sculptureWhy a house-price bubble means trouble
Selfies are mirrors we can freeze. A bunch of selfies is a contact sheet containing nothing but flattering choices. Selfies allow us to see how others look at themselves in a mirror making their modelling face when nobody’s around … except these days, everybody’s around everywhere all the time. And don’t we all know the blushy face and pretend-humble tone of voice used by selfie takers when we call out someone on posting a selfie? “This picture there? Oh, ha ha, you know, it’s just a casual shot I had in my camera. I shouldn’t have put such a casual shot up on Facebook. I do look good in it, though, don’t I?”
Selfies are the second cousin of the air guitar.
Selfies are the proud parents of the dick pic.
Selfies are, in some complex way, responsible for the word “frenemy”.
I sometimes wonder what selfies would look like in North Korea.
Selfies are theoretically about control – or, if you’re theoretically minded, they’re about the illusion of self-control. With a selfie some people believe you’re buying into a collective unspoken notion that everybody needs to look fresh and flirty and young for ever. You’re turning yourself into a product. You’re abdicating power of your sexuality. Or maybe you’re overthinking it – maybe you’re just in love with yourself.
I believe that it’s the unanticipated side effects of technology that directly or indirectly define the textures and flavours of our eras. Look at what Google has already done to the 21st century. So when smartphones entered the world in 2002, I think that if you gathered a group of smart media-savvy people in a room with coffee and good sandwiches, before the end of the day, the selfie could easily have been forecast as an inevitable smartphone side effect. There’s actually nothing about selfies that feels like a surprise in any way. The only thing that is surprising is the number of years it took us to isolate and name the phenomenon. I do note, however, that once the selfie phenomenon was named and shamed, selfies exploded even further, possibly occupying all of those optical-fibre lanes of the internet that were once occupied by Nigerian princes and ads for penis enlargement procedures.
I remember the analogue era as that wicker basket next to the landline phone filled with bad party shots and unflattering posed shots taken on windy days. But somewhere around 1999 those photos vanished and, while we live in a world of endless images, the images we see are almost never concretised on to paper. Perhaps that’s what bugs us about selfies, which are, technically, self-portraiture – it’s their fleetingness. We never get a chance to frame them and put them on our walls; they barely even stick to the walls of Facebook, let alone over the fireplace.
Will there be even more selfies in the future? Yes! Billions more, but the next selfie wave is going to be the 3D selfie, one in which one scans oneself and then prints out one’s 3D effigies in MakerBots at the mall or, as 3D printers become insanely cheaper (which is happening as I type these words), at home on the kitchen counter for $1.95. There still won’t be many printed photos in our future – nobody, in the end, seems to want them – but prepare to be inundated by small MakerBot plastic busts everywhere you look, modified and unmodified: him, her, me, them, them-with-devil-horns, her-with-three-eyes, you with a fork stuck into your forehead. It’s going to be fun, yet the weird thing about a printed-out bust is that it’s not quite the third dimension, and it’s not quite the second dimension either. It’s like photography posing as sculpture – a 2½th dimension.
The key word there is posing – the next wave of 2½D selfies will, with even more effectiveness, allow all of us to pose and put forth a model of who we think we are, as opposed to who we actually are. And what’s wrong with that? Artists have been doing it for thousands of years – and in the 21st century, with all of this kick-ass new technology we’re all, if nothing else, artists.

By Ryan Vlastelica
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Shemaroo expects YouTube tie-up to boost revenueShemaroo expects YouTube tie-up to boost revenue
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Oct 03, 2014 07:55 PM IST
Shemaroo Entertainment, a film content and entertainment business provider that recently went public, is expecting its five-year-old tie-up with YouTube to contribute to its business growth.
"We had tied up with YouTube five years ago. Whenever an ad is displayed on any of the 32 YouTube channels, we do get our pie of revenue as per the agreement with Google," Shemaroo director Jai Maroo told PTI, without disclosing the percentage of ad revenue from share from Google.
He further said the company is witnessing 1.5-2 million views per day or 45-60 million views a month, on an average.
"Digital ad spend is likely to grow at 32 per cent per annum over the next five years. More interestingly, 10 per cent of overall media and entertainment ad spend is on digital platform," Maroo noted.
The company cannot make any forward-looking statement as it is currently in a silent mode.
Internet subscriber base is constantly growing. By 2017 we will reach 49.6 crore from the current 10 crore, Maroo said.
The company's operational flow has been negative for the past couple of years.
"Currently we are in an investment mode for past couple of years and hence our operation flow has been negative (for past couple of years). Once our investment mode is completed, we will be in a much better position. It is for the same reason we raising money through an IPO," he said.
Mid last month, Shemaroo went public with an IPO, which got subscribed 7.37 times for Rs 100-crore issue.
Following the issue, the company got listed on the BSE and NSE on October 1.

Apartment where Ebola patient stayed expected to be cleaned FridayBy Mark Berman October 3 Follow @markberman

The apartment where Thomas Duncan stayed in Dallas  had still not been cleaned Friday morning, though this is expected to happen during the day, health officials said.
Still, this means that three days after Duncan was diagnosed, his quarantined relatives remained in an apartment with bags containing the sheets Duncan slept on and the blanket used to cover him while he was feverish, weak and feeling cold.
“This is something we expect to get resolved today,” Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview Friday morning on the “Today” show .
Frieden said the CDC has been working alongside local authorities to get the apartment cleaned. So far, he said that bleach has been used to clean the apartment. The delay speaks to the fact that, while authorities continue to stress that they are prepared for Ebola and ready to contain any cases, this situation is unprecedented in the United States.
“This is, after all, the first time we’ve ever had a case of Ebola in the U.S.,” he said.

As many as 100 people may have had contact with Duncan, a Liberian man, according to the CDC. However, they expect the actual number of people who had direct contact and require monitoring to be much lower, as they are trying to track down everyone with whom he had contact.
Four people in this apartment have been quarantined and ordered to remain home . The sheets Duncan slept on and his belongings have been placed in sealed plastic bags , Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said in a news conference Thursday.
But there was a delay in getting the apartment cleaned because there was “a little bit of hesitancy” in finding a company to do the work, David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Thursday.
In addition, officials were waiting for a permit that would allow hazardous materials to be taken on the state’s highways, according to the Associated Press .
People with Ebola are only contagious when they are displaying symptoms . Duncan began showing symptoms by Sept. 25, and that night he went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Even though he told the hospital he had traveled from West Africa, and had a fever and some abdominal pain, he was diagnosed with a low-grade virus and sent home , according to Texas Health Resources, the health-care system that oversees this hospital.
Duncan had told a nurse about his travel from Liberia, but that information was not shared with the entire team treating him. The hospital issued a statement late Thursday night saying that the lapse occurred because of the way the facility’s electronic health records system is set up.
Nurses and physicians see different portions of the system, and a patient’s travel history is included in the nurse’s segment but not the doctor’s, so “the travel history would not automatically” be visible to a doctor looking at the electronic record, the hospital said.
The facility has changed its system so that the travel history portion now appears before both nurses and physicians and specifically references the West African region being devastated by the epidemic, it said Thursday night.
Texas health officials said Thursday that the relatives of a Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola while visiting family in the U.S. are being quarantined in their home. (Reuters)

D.C. hospital evaluating patient who has Ebola-like symptomsBy Elahe Izadi , Susan Svrluga and Abby Ohlheiser October 3 Follow @ElaheIzadi Follow @SusanSvrluga Follow @abbyohlheiser
Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)
UPDATE: The District of Columbia Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday that they have ruled out Ebola for the patient at Howard University Hospital.
EARLIER STORY: Two Washington area hospitals said within hours of each other Friday that they had each admitted a patient with symptoms and travel histories associated with Ebola.
A person who had recently traveled to Nigeria came to Howard University Hospital in the District overnight "presenting symptoms that could be associated with Ebola," spokeswoman Kerry-Ann Hamilton said in a statement.
"In an abundance of caution, we have activated the appropriate infection control protocols, including isolating the patient," she said. "Our medical team continues to evaluate and monitor progress in close collaboration with the CDC and the Department of Health."
Just hours later, Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Md., north of Washington, confirmed that it was evaluating a patient who "presented with flu-like symptoms and a travel history that matches criteria for possible Ebola."
But on Friday night, Shady Grove Adventist officials said they had ruled out Ebola. "Our medical team has determined that the patient has malaria and does not have Ebola," the hospital said in a statement.
While Ebola continues to devastate West African nations including Liberia and Sierra Leone, the outbreak in Nigeria – where the Howard patient had traveled – may actually be coming to an end , with no new cases since Aug. 31, the CDC reported earlier this week. At one point, 894 people in Nigeria were being monitored since they had come into contact with someone sick with Ebola.

Overall, the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history has killed at least 3,439 people in West Africa and infected thousands more, according to the World Health Organization.
But before an Ebola case was confirmed in Dallas this week, there had not been a single Ebola diagnosis in the United States.
Potential Ebola patients who were evaluated in New York , California , New Mexico and Miami all tested negative for the virus.
[RELATED: How do you get Ebola? ]
People with Ebola are not contagious until they begin showing symptoms, which include a fever of greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, severe headache and vomiting. And you can only get Ebola through contact with a contagious person's bodily fluids.
Several Ebola patients have been transported from West Africa to the United States, including three Americans who were in Liberia — doctors Richard Sacra and Kent Brantly and missionary worker Nancy Writebol — who have already been discharged after they were successfully treated here. A Liberian American, Patrick Sawyer, fell ill after traveling to Nigeria and died of the disease.
The NIH in Bethesda recently admitted an American patient who had been exposed to Ebola.
On Thursday night, NBC News announced that a freelance cameraman working for the network in Liberia has tested positive for Ebola and will return to the United States for treatment.
In Maryland, all health providers and labs are required to report suspected Ebola cases to the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene immediately, said spokesman Christopher Garrett. The state agency works with local health departments to ensure that proper procedures, including isolation, are followed; information has been distributed to hospitals, nursing homes, labs and other providers.
Officials at several local hospitals said they have been following CDC guidelines. At the University of Virginia Health System, an emerging-infectious-diseases work group was formed earlier this year to respond to MERS; this summer, that group began preparedness planning for the possibility of Ebola infections.
The system has already been tested; the University of Virginia Health System has had one patient who met CDC criteria for Ebola screening, based on travel history, fever and other symptoms.
"We confirmed that concern with public health authorities and went through the formal process of admitting and evaluating that person for Ebola,” said Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology, infection prevention and control. “We ruled out the possibility of Ebola.”

We found mankinds first computer technology in an ancient Greek shipwreck and robots are going back for moreThe Sea
October 3, 2014
One of the world’s most mysterious artifacts was plucked from the Mediterranean sea in 1901, when a shipwreck discovered by Greek sponge divers off the coast of Antikythera yielded not just magnificent works of art but also what archeologists suppose is evidence of mankind’s earliest “computer”—an instrument dating to the era of Archimedes, with gears and dials for calculating solar and lunar cycles. What little they know about this device, dubbed the Antikythera mechanism , is intriguing enough to warrant high hopes that a modern-day exploration of the shipwreck will uncover additional fragments of the object, or other evidence of ancient innovation.
Scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Hellenic Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities are at the site right now for  a month-long excavation , the first one approved by the Greek government since 1976 (when Jacques Cousteau explored the wreck). This time, they’ve got 3D-mapping capabilities, autonomous robots, and a very special diving suit.  The technology—much of it used elsewhere for more prosaic purposes—has revolutionized underwater treasure-hunting since Cousteau’s time.
Tap image to zoom
(WHOI/Argo/John Fardoulis)
First, the Exosuit: an atmospheric diving system that allows its wearer to descend as far as 300 meters, or a thousand feet, below the sea surface and stay there for hours (50, if need be) without needing to decompress before returning to the surface. This allows the diver to walk around the Antikythera wreck, which lies a little under 200 feet deep, without experiencing any change in atmospheric pressure or even getting wet. Full specs  (PDF) are available from the suit’s manufacturer, Nuytco.  WIRED reports that the suit has been used by workers in New York to repair the city’s pipes and in Dubai to inspect oil pipelines.
Then there are the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), operated by a team of engineers from the Australian Centre for Marine Robotics. These robots are the key to mapping the shipwreck in 3D. The Sirius AUV, pictured below, has been sent on multiple trips around the site to record layers of data—including water column measurements and tens of thousands of high-resolution photos—to be stitched together for the map. Sirius has previously been used to monitor the health of Australian coral reefs. It can travel faster and farther than a human diver, even one equipped with jet-powered SCUBA fins.

(WHOI/John Fardoulis)
Of course, some plain old SCUBA diving is taking place around the wreck, too—though the divers are assisted by propulsion vehicles (these resemble small boat propellers attached to steering wheels) and closed circuit rebreathers, which are considered vast improvements over traditional oxygen and carbon dioxide tanks. Oh, and metal detectors.
When Cousteau’s team explored the Antikythera wreck in 1976, divers were limited to ten minutes on the ocean floor at a time. That was enough to offer tantalizing glimpses of what the wreck contained, and to recover some of it, but much was frustratingly out of sight and reach. This year’s cohort of archeologists has the opportunity to get a much fuller picture.

Fighting rages between rebels and government forces around airport in eastern Ukraine

(Pro-Russian rebels pressed…)
DONETSK: Pro-Russian rebels pressed Friday to seize a key airport in eastern Ukraine despite fierce resistance by government forces.
A reporter on Friday saw three rebel tanks firing their cannons at the main terminal of Donetsk airport, where government forces have holed up. Sniper shots rang around the area.
Rebels have made some gains in the area near the airport, seizing some buildings on its fringes and using them to target the main terminal.
Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko said two Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and another nine wounded since Thursday. He said that Ukrainian forces at the airport have undergone rotation and firmly stood their ground.
The airport, located just north of Donetsk, the largest city in the east, gives the Ukrainian forces a convenient vantage point to target rebel positions. Its loss would be a major blow to Ukraine and would also allow the rebels to receive large cargo planes with supplies in addition to truck convoys from Russia.
Fighting for the airport has intensified this week, threatening to derail the truce declared Sept. 5. A follow-up deal which called for both parties to pull back their artillery to create a buffer zone hasn't been implemented.
Kiev and the West have asserted that Moscow is fueling the separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine by providing arms and personnel, something Russia denies. Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, Yuriy Sergeyev, told reporters Friday that "it is evident that Russia demonstrates little resolve to fully comply with obligations under the Minsk arrangements."
He said the failure to follow the agreement "would be absolutely disastrous."
Sergeyev said Russia still regularly shells Ukrainian military and civilian areas.
"So far, positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been shelled about 800 times," he said. "As a result of these attacks, about 40 Ukrainian servicemen were killed and about 200 wounded."
At least a dozen civilians have been killed since the cease-fire, he added.
Residential areas in Donetsk have been caught in the crossfire. A Red Cross staffer died Thursday when a shell landed near the group's office in Donetsk.
The rebels said the shelling came from the Ukrainian side, while Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin blamed the death of the Red Cross worker on "terrorists."
A spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement late Thursday, saying the aid worker's death, along with the shelling of a school that killed three people earlier this week, "underscore the fragility of the current cease-fire and the importance of ensuring a secure environment in south-eastern Ukraine that will allow humanitarian actors to carry out their work and deliver critical assistance to those most in need."

4 things Chase customers should do right now4 things Chase customers should do right now
By Jose Pagliery   @Jose_Pagliery October 3, 2014: 1:15 PM ET
 
'Apple Pay' may be safer than plastic
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
If you're a Chase bank customer, you're right to feel powerless right now.
Hackers broke into JPMorgan's computer systems and stole more than 80 million customers' personal information, including their names, emails, physical addresses and phone numbers.
Anyone who used online banking or the Chase smartphone app were affected.
It's time to play defense.
1. Watch out for scammers. Hackers now have enough information to contact you, and they know you're a JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) customer.
Don't trust any phone calls, emails or letters claiming to be from the bank. Instead, directly call the number on your bank card or a previous statement.
Scam artists will seek even more information from you -- like your birthday, Social Security number or bank account number -- so they can tap into your account and steal your money.
And beware: Scammers will likely scan your Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ), Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) or LinkedIn ( LNKD , Tech30 ) page first. Expect them to sound like a bank that knows about your personal habits.
2. Don't change your login or get new cards -- yet. According to the bank, hackers didn't manage to steal usernames, passwords, account numbers or Social Security numbers.
As such, don't rush to change these things. It's an unnecessary inconvenience.
More importantly, though, you might have to change all these things later. The New York Times reported that hackers got root access to the bank's computer system. That's as deep as it gets.
So, hackers might still be lurking in the bank's computers -- even if the bank claims it closed the hole and has "no evidence" hackers are still inside its network.
 
Chase's 'ATM of the future'
3. Check your bank statement regularly. If hackers are still in the bank's computers, they could grab even more information.
Operate under the assumption you're at risk of fraud all the time. Carefully review your bank and credit card statements for any unexpected charges -- especially tiny ones.
Fraudsters typically test a stolen debit or credit card by charging a few cents on the card. They do it to avoid catching your attention.

Santelli: Yields tell the storysantelli: yields tell the story
Zydus plans to have 15 biologic products in two yearsZydus plans to have 15 biologic products in two years
BS Reporter | Ahmedabad Oct 03, 2014 08:59 PM IST
With an eye on the growing biologics market, Ahmedabad-based pharma major Cadila Healthcare (Zydus Cadila) is planning to mark its presence in the segment. The company plans to launch one to three products by next year, and hopes to have a portfolio of around 15 products in the market in a couple of year's time.
Biopharmaceuticals or biologics as they are also known are basically products that are extracted from or manufactured in biological sources, and are distinct from chemically synthesized pharmaceutical compounds. Biologics could be novel compounds or copy-cats called biosimilars.
Zydus is already working on novel biologics as well as biosimialars. "In India we already have six products in the market, and is one of the larger players in the segment. It plans to launch at least one to three products by next year in the segment," informed a senior company official.
It is pushing three programs in biologics the US, and back in India it has 18 programs, and by next year it should have around nine products in the market. In another couple of years, Zydus would have a portfolio of at least 15 biologics in the Indian market. There are plans to have two would be novel biologics which should be in the market in about three years.
As such the global market for biosimilars could touch $250 billion by 2020, and the company is working hard to tap the opportunity. It has invested significantly in developing capabilities in research. It has set up a new plant for manufacturing biosimilars a few years back.
As a senior official of the company explained, "We took a long time to scale up capabilities, whether in chemistry, biochemistry, biologics. Now, whether it is small molecule research of large biologic research, what used to take around seven to eight years time earlier (to reach proof of concept), we can do it in three years time now."
It also has an alliance with German biopharma firm Pieris AG to develop and sell multiple anticalin protein therapeutics, a new class of drugs that can be used for the treatment of a variety of disorders.

Gujarat FDCA to start operations at Patan drug testing labGujarat FDCA to  start operations at Patan drug testing lab

The Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA) is likely to start full operations at the food testing laboratory at Patan in around a month's time that would double the drug testing capacity of the state.
The laboratory that has come up with an investment of around Rs 55 crore would also be able to offer testing services for medical devices, H G Koshia, commissioner of Gujarat FDCA said. For that matter, it is likely to be a part of the Centre's plan to have testing labs all over the country.
At present, there are around three testing labs in the state. Of these, two are food testing labs (at Rajkot and Bhuj) and one is a food and drug testing lab at Vadodara.
Work on the food and drug testing combination lab at Sidhpur in Patan district is in the final stages.
Once operational, the Sidhpur lab would be able to test around 7,500 samples in a year.
As for the Vadodara lab, it can test over 7,500 drug samples annually. Currently it tests around 6,000 and 6,500 samples in a year. Hence, with the new lab becoming operational, the drug testing capacity of the state would virtually double.
Earlier, last year the FDCA had set afoot the idea of a mobile drug testing laboratory for spurious drugs. This is expected to expedite the process of detection of spurious drugs. Currently, the state FDCA is a team of around 150 drug inspectors, and is likely to ask for another 15 more to take care of additional districts.
The state government added seven new districts in 2013, taking the total number of districts in the state to 33.

Auto major Tata Motors is upbeat about the growth of compact sedan segment in Madhya Pradesh and expects the festive demand to help auto sector recover from the current slag, said officials.
Last month, the company launched its compact sedan 'Zest' which received very good response throughout the country.
"In Madhya Pradesh, auto sector witnessed lows last year which continued in the first quarter of this year but the compact sedan segment has beaten the trend," said Prashant Fadnavis, head - emerging markets, passenger vehicle business unit, Tata Motors.
The compact sedan segment growth last year was 34 per cent and in the first quarter of this year, it witnessed 22 per cent growth, hence we are extremely confident about good demand in this segment in the coming days, added Fadnavis.
Keeping in view the demand for its compact sedan Zest, Tata Motors has ramped up its production, said officials.
Currently, demand for Zest has been overwhelming and its petrol variants (Revotron engine) have a waiting period of six weeks. While, the waiting period for Zest diesel is four weeks, and for Zest AMT is three months waiting, added officials.

CINCINNATI (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says pellet guns have been pulled from shelves at the Ohio store where a 22-year-old man holding an air rifle was fatally shot by police.
A spokesman for the world's largest retailer tells The Associated Press that the move last week was a store-specific decision, not a change in national policy.
A special grand jury in the racially charged case decided last week that officers' actions Aug. 5 were justified. Police responded to a 911 call that a man was waving what appeared to be a rifle, and officers have said John Crawford III, who was black, was shot after not responding to commands to drop his weapon.
It turned out to be an air rifle.
A family attorney calls Wal-Mart's action "about eight weeks too late."

How Clayco is investing in smart building products0
A. There is no set dollar amount. We have a pretty big balance sheet to do the deals we find interesting. We have the flexibility to do small and large deals. We’re going to be doing things within a range of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions of dollars.
Q. What’s your investment profile?
A. We’re looking at things like mobile technology and smart building products, which can be both more cost effective and energy efficient. When you combine that with some of these technologies that can make that building smarter, that allows the user of the building to have a better experience. Their iPhone becomes their security badge. Smart window technology tints the window based on the where the sun is and the weather outside. Getting back to core construction, we’re looking at technologies that can make that (construction) guy more efficient in the field with new tools and mobile devices that tell him where he needs to be and when.
Q. What lessons have you learned about putting together the right team?
A. I’ve been in a situation when a transaction was taking place and the founders walked away with a lot of money. Even though they said it wasn’t going to change their perspective, it did. I learned that if you’re going to write a big check to someone, you either need to make sure you have hooks in them to keep them incentivized, which maybe means less cash and more equity to share on the upside or you make sure there’s a team below them that can take the reins. That was a big learning experience that I can certainly apply here. You need to make sure you’ve got a team that you can partner with going forward and that they’re aligned with you on a longer term.

Sports cars and half-ton trucks on display at 2014 automotive rally.
There's a lot to look forward to as 2015 cars starting gracing showroom floors.
Every affiliation has its conventions and automotive ones are interactive. There’s no better place to be as far as work goes. Over 80 new models were available to 70 members of the Midwest Automotive Media Association during its annual fall rally at the Autobahn Country Club in Joliet, Ill., on Wednesday. For some members, it's the first time they’ll see cars that are forthcoming on dealer lots, while other members are reminded of models vying for year-end votes on the industry’s most coveted awards. Either way, the day-long program helps automakers prep their presentations before it hits the public. With temps in the low seventies and sunny skies streaked with clouds, the rally at the Autobahn was a high point of the year before auto show season shifts into first gear.
1. Too much BMW?
For nearly a decade, automakers have all but ignored mid-size trucks, issuing few new models — or even updates — and expecting few sales. They focused instead on high-volume full-size trucks and all sizes of SUVs and crossovers. ( David Undercoffler )
Like Bruce Dickinson and the cowbell, some folks have a fever, and the only prescription is more BMW. Since 2007, BMW has nearly doubled its product line from seven models to thirteen, and nearly tripled its trim levels from 33 to 82. Fortunately, the world’s biggest luxury car maker had only four models at the rally, but one of them was arguably the most scrutinized luxury launch of the year: the i8, BMW’s plug-in hybrid supercar. Since there are currently only eight in the country, there was a wait for the harbinger of BMW’s hybrid powerplants. The 357-horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque come from a small electric motor up front and rear-mounted, turbocharged, 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine. Take a second to soak up that last part, because in no way does it feel like a three-cylinder anywhere.  Acceleration is fairly linear, though not as much as a pure electric vehicle, but theres no questioning its reported 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. Wide sills make getting in and out a stretch, but once inside we were surprised at the roominess and comfort for both passenger and driver. The rear seats are useless.
As exciting as it was, I was more smitten by the M4 coupe , which in guided track laps only gave me a hint of its capabilities. Whatever comes of the i8, the M4 remains the paragon of BMW.
2. American speed
News broke yesterday that the 2015 Corvette Z06 was insanely fast , hitting the 60 mph mark in 2.95 seconds, making it the fastest front-engine rear-wheel drive production car. It wasn’t available for test laps but the Z28 was and it’ll rock your rib cage.
Then there’s Dodge. While the rest of the auto industry tends to maximize fuel efficiency, Dodge is out parading a four-door family sedan that makes 701 horsepower. The Charger Hellcat was not to be driven, but the full stable of Challengers, including the bat out of Hellcat, were there. As was the Viper, in case Dodge wanted to out-Dodge itself. American muscle car lovers rejoice, the renaissance is in full swing.
0
I feel like we’ve been covering America’s beloved pony car a lot in the past 10 months, partly because we love 50th anniversaries and partly because there’s a 1968 Ford Mustang convertible in the family.
Ford offered up the 2.3-liter EcoBoost and the 5.0-liter V-8 available for test laps yesterday. I took the EcoBoost first, and was impressed with the interior styling—a mix of race-car like switches and round cluster gauges. The miniscule buttons of MyFord Touch are still present on the touchscreen, but redundant steering wheel controls minimize the need to use it. The steering wheel is busy with buttons, which is a turn off. The EcoBoost had plenty of pep, and got in and out of corners without any roll. But it’s nothing compared to the hungry V-8. That beast wanted out of guided laps, wanted to overtake whatever was in its path. Starting at $32,100, there’s a lot to love about the 2015 Mustang GT.
4. Year of the truck?
There were a lot more trucks on display at this year’s fall rally, including the American-made full-size SUV lineup and a GMC Yukon made for police fleets (no sirens, that’s up to the buyers from each municipality). The most notable were GM’s two all-new midsize offerings, the GMC Canyon and the Chevy Colorado , which are injecting life into a moribund segment. While GM is hoping to lure in owners of outdated Ford Rangers or steer potential buyers away from the segment-dominating Toyota Tacoma, the big play is to bring people back who had bought into the crossover craze. The inside seats five comfortably and has more refinement than you’d expect from a pickup. I drove the Canyon with a V-6 over a rutted off-road path, and it seemed equally capable of going through work zones and hunting grounds as it would cruising city streets. The V6 gets 26 mpg highway and is versatile in a way not normally associated with pickups. For people who use an SUV as much for hauling or towing as other duties, the new fangled midsize pickup may be the better bet.
5. Off-roading is more fun than guided track laps
I’d forgotten how much fun a Jeep is. In the wooded area in the center of the North track at the Autobahn Country Club, Jeep set up an off-road course through hill and dell, across a sticky creek with steep descents. The course was guided at every point, but splashing up mud and tilting over hills was a blast, especially since Jeep’s hill descent technology and other features made negotiating the course dummy proof. 
Guided track laps can minimize a car from showcasing its abilities, whereas the off-road course really puts the vehicle through a workout. Even the Subaru Outback seemed happy dipping along the rutted truck path that skirted the off-road forest course.
2015 models are hitting dealer lots soon. Take a test drive, it’ll be worth a weekend.

JPMorgan: 76 million customers hackedJPMorgan: 76 million customers hacked
By James O'Toole   @jtotoole October 3, 2014: 8:00 AM ET
 
So you've been hacked... Now what?
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
JPMorgan said Thursday that cybercriminals gathered information on more than 80 million account holders as part of a massive bank hack this summer.
The revelation follows news back in August that hackers had infiltrated seven of the country's largest banks, using sophisticated malware to burrow into their computer systems and manipulate records.
At JPMorgan ( JPM ), the hackers got contact information for 76 million households and 7 million small businesses, including names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses, as well as "internal JPMorgan Chase information relating to such users."
Related: What you need to know about the big bank hack
But the bank said that the hackers didn't get any account information -- account numbers, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers -- and that it hasn't seen "any unusual customer fraud related to this incident."
"The Firm continues to vigilantly monitor the situation and is continuing to investigate the matter," JPMorgan said in a securities filing , adding that it is cooperating with law enforcement.
JPMorgan said anyone who uses its online services were affected by the hack. That includes its website and smartphone app. The bank did not immediately clarify to CNNMoney whether customers who only do in-person banking were spared.
Although it appears that the hackers haven't been able to access bank accounts, they could still cash in by selling email addresses and other personal information to spammers.
The source of this summer's attack still isn't clear. Some analysts have pointed to hackers Russia, though the evidence is only circumstantial.
Related: FBI investigating hack on JPMorgan
Hackers from Russia and eastern Europe are often top FBI suspects in cyberattacks. The timing of the hack raised suspicions given the mounting tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine and economic sanctions.
In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, JPMorgan said it planned to deploy over 1,000 people and budget $250 million annually to focus on cybersecurity.
CNNMoney's Jose Pagliery contributed reporting.

Alibaba May Be Ascendant  But Bomoda Gives Brands Their Own "Open Sesame" For Chinareddit
In the classic tale, "Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves," the protagonist undergoes a rags-to-riches transformation to emerge as the sole guardian of a secret incantation ("Open Sesame") that grants him exclusive access to an immeasurable, hidden treasure.
How fitting, then, that this story's modern corporate namesake - the Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba.com (NYSE: BABA ) - has just experienced the largest IPO in stock market history, and now dominates online sales in the most populous country on earth, handling 80% of all transactions .  Certainly, the news of the last few weeks would seem to indicate that Alibaba is now the prime purveyor of a much sought-after "Open Sesame" for Western brands in China.
That is, of course, if brands market their products through Alibaba.
Brand visibility on a dominant online sales channel can, and will, move product. It is therefore understandably tempting for Western brands (including those already engaged in China, and those that still plan to become engaged) to simply peg their future business objectives on a focal partnership with Alibaba. Make no mistake; Alibaba is a force that cannot be under-appreciated.
However, the quest for long term brand health and ever-increasing profit in China dictates that marketers cannot simply abdicate their roles to third parties, but must formulate and continuously evolve their own vision, strategies, and tactics within China's rapidly changing marketplace.  To successfully navigate such challenges, managers must develop and maintain a deep understanding of their brands' multifaceted resonance and engagement with Chinese consumers.
Just as Alibaba was dominating worldwide headlines during the last few weeks, a breakthrough, strategic data management tool to understand brand dynamics and impact in China was unveiled by the New York-based high-tech start-up, Bomoda , in its just-released, free report, " Into China: 2014 Bomoda Brand Index - How 300 Western Brands Impact Consumers ."
Established in 2012 by one of the founders of Hulu with seed-investment from several marketing and web luminaries including a former CEO of Yahoo!,  Bomoda was originally conceived as a curated, Chinese-language e-newsletter and e-commerce portal linking global Chinese consumers to high fashion and luxury brands . According to Bomoda's CEO, Brian Buchwald, the initial rationale for Bomoda's business model was two-fold.: First, the exponentially growing tide of affluent, global Chinese travelers ( exceeding 100 million trips annually ) presents a unique, and still largely untapped, opportunity for brands to connect with quintessential 'mission shoppers' who are ardent in their pursuit of information about Western fashion and luxury trends and products. At the same time, Bomoda saw vast potential with consumers inside China who overwhelmingly prefer to purchase luxury goods from overseas as a more cost efficient option than buying from retailers inside China - transactions that are subject to steep domestic luxury taxes.  Since the company's inception, Bomoda's vision has borne fruit - with a rapidly growing base of Chinese subscribers to its foundational newsletter, and an expanding range of marketing and e-commerce partnerships with major luxury brands and retailers including Gucci, Lane Crawford, Ferragamo, Omega, Estee Lauder, Cartier, and many others.
As Bomoda's operations grew, an opportunity for a new business vertical rapidly emerged. "While we were engaging an ever-increasing range of  Western brand and retail partners, it became clear that although many of these clients viscerally understood the current and future importance of Chinese consumers to their business, they still experienced ongoing challenges in maintaining detailed, real-time knowledge of Chinese shopper behavior, and the dynamics of their brands within the Chinese marketplace," said Buchwald. "And, this was not only true for brands lacking their own direct presence in China, but also among professionals with global decision-making responsibilities in companies boasting worldwide operations. In many cases, these executives lamented to us that the regional knowledge within their China units did not always easily flow back into their global organizations."
To answer this need, Bomoda has now expanded its offering by establishing a new China Business Intelligence Service to address critical gaps in China market knowledge faced by Western brand executives. This service centers on a proprietary brand data analysis and management system that benchmarks current brand impact in China, while delineating strategic and tactical priorities for brands to achieve future growth. Bomoda's clients receive reports through a customized dashboard delivered on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule as needed.
Utilizing this system, the 2014 Bomoda Brand Index focuses on Western brands headquartered in Europe, North America, and Australia - brands which, relative to those originating in Asia, face greater cultural, linguistic, and business challenges in establishing relevancy with Chinese consumers.  The 300 brands in this first report have been organized into 'peer sets' based on their primary product lines and pricing, with a total of seven categories highlighted in the findings: Luxury, Accessible Luxury, Contemporary, High Street, Beauty and Cosmetics, Jewelry/Watches/Accessories, and Multi-Brand Retailers (a wide range of other categories - including non-luxury categories - will be addressed in future reports). Unlike many other established brand rankings for China which are wholly based on periodic consumer surveys, Bomoda's data analysis centers on over 250 discrete data points that, together, offer a comprehensive picture of how the target brands interact with Chinese consumers.
Such data includes current social media performance across a wide range of platforms (e.g. not just Weibo and WeChat), search, PR/KOL-reference, degree of mobile engagement, impact of existing brand websites (and corresponding Chinese relevancy), and current e-commerce performance. Bomoda's algorithm then utilizes factor analysis to weight different clusters of these variables, and to ultimately 'score' each target brand on three dimensions: Reach, Engagement, and Experience. What emerges are rankings that reflect actual in-market conditions, versus what consumers report they think, feel, and do in the more 'aloof' context of a market research survey.
While the overall ranking of the 300 brands in the Bomoda report contains a large number of top brands that are known to be already heavily focused on, and active in, China (Burberry, Nike, Coach, Chanel, Gucci, and many others), the report also underscores the rapidly emerging global orientation of Chinese consumers through its ranking of brands which, while still largely inactive in their own marketing efforts in China, are nevertheless already garnering growing Chinese consumer attention.
The Bomoda report offers a master ranking of all 300 brands, followed by a ranking of the top-25 brands in each of the seven categories highlighted. For each category, the report also offers detailed insights, current practices, and data correlations for the three output dimensions of Reach, Engagement, and Experience.
Said Buchwald, "This report, and the customizable analytical services Bomoda now offers, are meant to be both informative and practical. Even if a brand chooses to partner wholly, or in part, with a powerhouse like Alibaba, it should not choose to do so as a 'concession' or 'default' in response to a lack of market understanding. Rather, we want to equip our clients to make the best, informed, strategic decisions. We also hope our data will allow brands to wrest back direct control of the billions in value that is currently transacted through re-sellers on Alibaba and other platforms. In sum, we want to empower our clients to be stewards of their own brand destinies in China."

Former Fed Boss Ben Bernanke Denied Mortgage Refinance
NDTV | Written By: Varun Sinha | Updated On: October 03, 2014 13:37 (IST)
Arcil Cuts Bad Loan Purchase Target by 30 Per Cent to Rs 3,500 Crore
Imagine Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan being turned down for a home loan once he retires. Yet, that is exactly what happened to former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who was till February 2014, the most powerful central banker in the world.
At a conference in Chicago on Thursday, Mr Bernanke said he was unsuccessful in refinancing his mortgage, Bloomberg News reported. Refinancing means replacing an existing loan with a new loan offering lower interest rate or more flexible tenure.
According to reports, Mr Bernanke wanted to refinance the mortgage on his Capitol Hill house, which he and his wife had bought for $839,000 (nearly Rs 5 crore at 1 dollar=60 rupee) in 2004.
Mr Bernanke, who has not taken up a regular job after two terms at the Federal Reserve, reportedly charges $250,000 (Rs 1.5 crore) for giving a speech and has also signed a book contract, which is expected to fetch him millions of dollars.
According to analysts, his application for refinance was rejected on grounds that he recently changed his job, a criteria that makes getting credit difficult even in India.
Mr Bernanke's revelation led to many hilarious tweets,
Binyamin Appelbaum@BCAppelbaum
Name: Ben Bernanke. Job? None. Other sources of income? I'm writing a book. And giving speeches. #DENIED
Money.com@MONEY
Don't feel bad if you can't refinance your mortgage: Even Ben Bernanke can't get a loan
zerohedge@zerohedge
Going forward instead of getting paid at a rate of $250,000 per hour, Ben Bernanke would prefer a mortgage refi LOI instead
The episode highlights the tight credit situation in the US property market, economists say. It also shows how rigid lending rules have become post the subprime mortgage crisis that triggered the global recession in 2008.
The subprime crisis resulted from banks extending mortgages to risky buyers on high interest rates. Large investment firms then bought such loans as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). A number of such loans became delinquent starting in 2007, triggering bankruptcy across many banks in the US. The fallout was a major contributor to the global recession that followed.

Live telecast of RSS chief's speech irks Opposition
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat’s annual speech on Dussehra — and its unprecedented live telecast by public broadcaster Doordarshan — demonstrated the bonding and synergy between the Sangh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but drew sharp criticism from the Opposition and the social media.
On Thursday, Mr. Bhagwat’s speech lauded the Central government for “its initiatives on the front of economy, border security, international relations and many other areas.” The RSS chief, who underlined Hindutva as the core of Indian nationalism, added: “But we need to wait for some more time with a sense of hope and faith. The government should now ensure that these policies maintain their momentum in a determined and well-organised manner.”
Mr. Modi, a former full-time activist of the Sangh, tweeted in response: “Mohan Bhagwatji talked about important national issues in his speech. The issues of social reform that he raised are very relevant today.”
Opposition uproar
Doordarshan’s decision to telecast the RSS chief’s speech live did not go down well with the Opposition that severely criticised the broadcaster and the government. Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi said: “This is absolutely shockin
The Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) condemned the live telecast. “The RSS used the occasion to propagate its Hindutva ideology,” it said.
Doordarshan’s Director General (News) Archna Datta however, told The Hindu that each event is judged by its news worthiness. “We found it news worthy.”

Supreme Court declines urgent hearing plea of Sahara chief SubrataRoySubrata Roy was seeking bail to attend the cremation and perform rituals relating to the death of his aunt. (AP)
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: October 3, 2014 8:16 pm
The Supreme Court today declined to give an urgent hearing to the plea of jailed Sahara chief Subrata Roy seeking bail to attend the cremation and perform rituals relating to the death of his aunt.
The application was mentioned by Roy’s advocates at the residence of Chief Justice H L Dattu who said that there is no urgency in the matter and it will come for hearing in the regular court.
Official sources said that Roy had sought relief for 15 days.
His aunt, who was staying with the Sahara chief’s family, had died yesterday in Lucknow at the age of 90.
On Wednesday, Roy was sent back to his cell in Tihar jail at the end of the period granted by the Supreme Court to stay at an air conditioned facility in the complex to negotiate sale of his overseas luxury hotels.
The court had extended Roy’s stay at the Tihar Jail conference room by 15 days on September 8 for him to sell the properties to raise Rs 10,000 crore to be deposited with SEBI for his bail.
The Supreme Court, on August 1 had allowed Roy and two of his group directors to use the fully air-conditioned conference room in Tihar jail complex for 10 days from August 5, within a given time lot of 6:00 am to 8:00 pm.
The meetings held by the group under the surveillance of CCTV cameras.
Roy, 65, was using the conference room with services like Wi-Fi and video-conferencing. He was allowed two laptops, two desktops, landline phones with STD/ISD facilities and a mobile phone.
Two secretarial and one technical person were also allowed to assist him. Roy has been lodged in Tihar Jail since March 4 this year.

Western firms prefer Indian executives for language andexpertiseHaving an Indian executive in a senior role can help companies make more informed decisions about their plans for the country. (Reuters)
PTI | Singapore | Posted: October 3, 2014 8:12 pm | Updated: October 3, 2014 8:22 pm
Indian executives have emerged as preferred candidates with Western companies looking to appoint Asian directors on their boards, according to analysis done by Singapore-based placement firm.
DTCA, a firm specialising in placing executives in top roles and on company boards, analysed the composition of the boards of the 20 largest companies in four leading economies in the world -United States, Germany, France and UK.
The number of Asian executives holding non-executive director positions in these companies has risen to 23 this year, from just nine in 2009.
Indian executives are leading this pack, with 8 of them holding such positions with top multinational companies currently, said DTCA.
“With an increasing number of Western companies looking to expand in Asia, especially in India, there is a growing belief that you need to have local talent at the very senior level to be able to fully exploit the region’s growth potential,” said Fabrice Desmarescaux, Managing Partner and Co-Founder of DTCA, who has nearly 20 years’ experience working with top Asian executives.
The trend has gathered pace over the past five years as Western companies have focused their attention on expanding their business in Asian economies such as India.
As these companies boost their presence in the region further, they have been looking to appoint Asian executives to their boards to help them achieve their goals, not least because they want to understand the markets and the culture in order to fully exploit the opportunities, he said.
“Gathering the board once a year in Asia, beyond the entertainment value for the directors and the cosmetic announcement effect at the AGM, will not help.
The best way for boards to make informed decisions about Asia is to appoint Asian directors,” said Desmarescaux.
He said Indian executives are being appointed by Western companies for reasons like felicity with English language, market size, regional expertise and prior familiarity with western firms.
Indian executives, especially those in senior roles, tend to speak fluent English which makes it easier for companies to deal with them and vice versa.
It is a key market for many western companies.
Having an Indian executive in a senior role can help companies make more informed decisions about their plans for the country.
Many Indian executives are also well versed with other regional economies and can help the Western companies formulate expansion strategies in those countries as well.
They have often worked with Western multinationals and are well versed with their business model and practices.
That coupled with their local knowledge makes them a key asset to have on the board.

Poor-rich gap growing in India  Asia-Pacific:UNESCAPPrint
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: October 3, 2014 8:08 pm
The gap between the poor and the rich is growing in the Asia-Pacific region and there has been an increase in income inequality in many major economies including India, China and Indonesia, a UNESCAP report has said.
“Inequality is…key socio-economic challenge for the region. At the national level, there has been an increase in income inequality in many major economies in recent decades,” said the report of United Nations – Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific.
“Widening income gaps across societies and within communities are the consequence of a series of factors,” it added.
The Gini coefficient – a measure of income inequality – between early 1990s and late 2000s increased from 30.8 to 33.9 in India; 32.4 to 42.1 in China and in Indonesia it increased from 29.2 to 38.1, the report said.
However, during the same period the coefficient decreased in countries such as Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand and Uzbekistan.
Weaker labour market institutions, inadequate social protection systems, poor-quality education, inadequate access to credit and land and excessive asset concentration are among the factors for widening income gaps, the report said.
“The gap between rich and poor is widespread in the region and continuing to grow in many countries…the poorest 20 per cent of the population accounts for less than 10 per cent of national income,” it said.
UN-ESCAP conducted the study for about 40 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
The data ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) in the regions shows that persons with a net worth of USD 30 million or more accounted for 30 per cent of the region’s income in 2012-13, the report said.
“This shows that wealth concentration is a major characteristic of income inequality. The region had around 49,000 persons (0.001 per cent of Asia-Pacific population in 2013) classed as UHNWIs, with about USD 7.5 trillion of net wealth in 2012-13,” it added.
The wide gap in national income held by the ultra-rich and the poor is striking, the report said.
“It has been observed that the wealth-income ratio is rising due to the growing share of capital in national income, which is further exacerbating the inequality gap between the top 1 per cent of the population and the poorest 20 per cent.”
In addition to vertical inequality among individuals, there have also been widening horizontal disparities, especially between rural and urban areas, as well as between coastal regions and the interior.
“This is particularly worrying for large multiracial countries with significant regional variations, since it can trigger social and political instability,” the report added.

RSS chief Bhagwat says Hindutva is India's 'national identity', Opposition condemns live telecast of speech by DD

Nagpur: In an address whose live telecast by Doordarshan sparked a controversy, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday described Hindutva as the country's "national identity" and the "thread of unity" running through its diversities.
Speaking at the customary function on Dusshera which coincides with 89th foundation day of his organisation, the RSS chief also patted the Narendra Modi government for initiatives on national security, economy and international relations in a short period of four months.
The hour-long broadcast by DD for the first time of an RSS function stoked a row with Congress and CPI(M) attacking the government for "misuse" of the state broadcaster while BJP defended it, saying RSS genuinely contributed to patriotism and always patronised 'justice to all' philosophy.
RSS chief patted the Modi government for initiatives on national security, economy and international relations in a short period of four months.
#mohan bhagwat #mohan bhagwat address #rss #narendra modi government
Coming out in support of Bhagwat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the address, saying the issues of social reform the RSS chief raised are "very relevant" today.
"Mohan Bhagwat ji talked about important national issues in his speech. The issues of social reform that he raised are very relevant today," Modi tweeted.
In his address, Bhagwat said RSS has been engaged since 1925 in building a virtuous, strong and organised society.
"The all inclusive and all encompassing truth is what we call Hindutva. It is our national identity. That is why we should take the Sangh Shakha to each home in every village, street and community," he said.
"Sangh has been doing it for many decades. It believes in unity in diversity, which does not ask anybody to leave anything except their vices and arrogance, which is the thread of unity running through the country's diversities, this is Hindutva," he said.
Deprecating the live telecast, Congress spokesman Sandeep Dikshit said it was a "dangerous tradition".
"It is a dangerous tradition. This is not an organisation which is completely neutral. It is a controversial organisation," he said, adding it is a political decision of the government.
His party colleague Abhishek Manu Singhvi feared that from now on, the country would be ruled through the official media "for Nagpur, by Nagpur and of Nagpur".
Condemning the live broadcast, CPI(M) said, "The RSS uses the occasion to propagate its Hindutva ideology."
The CPI also came out against the live telecast with its National Secretary D Raja saying the government, particularly the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, should give an explanation to the people for allowing DD to be the mouthpiece for the RSS.
In his address, Bhagwat said people should give some more time to the Modi government for expeditious and efficient execution of its policies.
Unless the last person in the country feels satisfied with welfare initiatives, security and safety, the government cannot complete its task, the RSS chief said.
"We don't have a magic wand to change but the government seems committed," the Sangh chief noted.
Bhagwat said Modi's recent visit to the US has sent positive signals and has ushered a new enthusiasm among people of the country.
"A new ray of hope has entered in the hearts of the people. The entire country was feeling proud of the visit and the subsequent talks with the US government," he said, adding, the world needs India.
Voicing concern over upsurge in jihadi activities across the country especially in southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, he said the nation is yet to see the impact of an effective policy to curb such threats to national security.
"There is no visible reduction in smuggling of rare minerals from southern coast (Kerala and Tamil Nadu). The population imbalance in West Bengal and Kerala has been caused by illegal migration of a particular community from across the national border.
"The ruling parties in those states have adopted a 'near surrender policy' and that has led to serious threat to the life of local population besides law and order situation as well as national security," Bhagwat said.
"The nation has yet to see the impact of joint plan of Central and state government in putting effective checks on these jihadi and Naxal activities," he said.
Bhagwat also referred to the Sangh's pet issues of cow slaughter ban and said there should be complete prohibition of this practice.
"We feel it necessary to put a ban on meat exports, beef in particular, and cow smuggling in the immediate future," he said.
Asking people to boycott Chinese products, he said, "We speak about self-dependence and standing up to China. The new government seems to be standing up to it. But where will the government draw strength if we don't stop buying things from Chinese-made idols of our gods and goddesses and other products of daily use."
The right-wing, volunteer Hindu nationalist organisation was formed on Vijay Dashmi in 1925 in Nagpur.

Washington: The US visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was "extremely successful" and his summit talks with President Barack Obama gave both leaders an opportunity to share their vision for the bilateral relationship and energized the strategic partnership, the White House said.
During the private dinner that Obama held on September 29 for Modi, both leaders shared anecdotes. Phil Reiner, senior director for India at the National Security Council, said that Obama was looking forward to the dinner as it provided an "excellent opportunity to get to know each other better".
The "small, private official working dinner" in the White House provided a "unique opportunity for the two leaders to sit together and exchange ideas", he said.
The focus of the talks was on challenges of governance and the issues associated with reform and the vision that Modi and Obama have for the bilateral relationship.
#modi meets america #narendra modi #barack obama #modi in us
The focus of the talks was on challenges of governance and the issues associated with reform and the vision that Modi and Obama have for the bilateral relationship.
He said that during the dinner, much of the conversation was on the mandate that the two came into office with and the challenges both face to put the agenda into action.
Both leaders found "lot of commonality" and discussed ways in how to make the government more accessible.
Both discussed how to increase engagement between the government and the people and the affinity between the two nations.
Modi shared his vision for India, and how he has launched the scheme of bank accounts for all, his digital India mission and of having a chief technical officer in every department, said Reiner.
The engagement was "very positive" and both "shared personal anecdotes", he said.
The talks on Sep 30 focussed on their bilateral strategic partnership, on regional issues, economic ties, defence and security issues and climate change among other matters.
"I would say that the assessment on our part is that the prime minister's visit was extraordinarily successful. It has provided a boost in terms of the vision and focus that we have for our bilateral relations, and energized the strategic partnership," Reiner told foreign correspondents.
Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Nisha Desai Biswal, said the discussions "went a long way in re-energising and re-launching the bilateral relationship".
She said that Modi "shared his very robust vision for India's transformation, and the things he wants to go work on, and it resonated with the president, and all of us who were there".

Gujarat refuses to permit SIT plea challenging Maya KodnanisbailPress Trust of India | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 3, 2014 9:27 pm
The Gujarat Government has refused permission to the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team to challenge the bail given to former Minister Maya Kodnani in a post-Godhra riot case.
Kodnani, who was given bail by Gujarat High Court, was convicted in the Naroda Patia riot case – in which 97 people were killed – and awarded 28-year jail term by the trial court.
“We have taken a decision of not granting permission to SIT to file an appeal before the Supreme Court to challenge bail to Kodnani on the basis of some past judgements of the apex court,” Law and Justice Secretary V P Patel said.
Kodnani, who handled Women and Child Development portfolio in the then Narendra Modi Cabinet, was granted bail by the High Court on July 30 on health grounds.
Prashant Desai, Special Public Prosecutor representing SIT, said the State Government had sought his opinion on challenging Kodnani’s bail in the apex court.
“When Mayaben Kodnani was granted bail by the High Court, the State Government sought my opinion on whether or not to file an appeal in the Supreme Court.
“Looking into the situation and facts of the case, I was of the opinion that there is a remote chance of success. Despite my opinion, the Gujarat Government has all the authority to go to the Supreme Court,” Desai maintained.
The HC had granted bail to the former MLA considering her submission that she suffered from acute depression and tuberculosis, for which she is being treated at Ahmedabad City Civil Hospital.
Kodnani’s sentence was also suspended till her appeal against the trial court order is disposed by the High Court. Kodnani, who was convicted as a ‘kingpin’ of the massacre, was sentenced to a 28-year jail term by a special trial court in Naroda Patia area of Ahmedabad city, and she became the first convict in the Naroda Patia case to get regular bail from the Gujarat High Court.
The three-time legislator was also the first woman to be convicted in a post-Godhra riots case.
Kodnani, who was a BJP MLA representing Naroda at the time of the 2002 riots, was made Minister of State for Women and Child Development in the 2007 Narendra Modi-led Gujarat cabinet.
However, Kodnani had to resign after her arrest in the case in March 2009.
In August 2012, a special SIT court had awarded life imprisonment to then BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi and 29 others for their roles in the 2002 riots in Ahmedabad at Naroda Patia.
The massacre had taken place a day after the Godhra train burning incident of February 27, 2002.
The Naroda Patia massacre case is one of the nine cases investigated by the Supreme Court appointed SIT which probed Godhra and post-Godhra riots in the year 2002.

Busting One of Tech s Biggest MythsThese guys have been busting myths for over a decade since the show premiered in 2003.

Although not the typical guests you would expect at a tech conference, Savage and Hyneman said Evernote reached out to them because they’re both “esoteric makers” for many different kinds of projects. They’re working on a future collaboration project that will be revealed to the public in the near future.
After the speech, Business Insider caught up with the MythBusters hosts to ask what was the single coolest tech myth they’ve ever busted on the show.
“Using a cellphone will not blow up the gas station,” Savage said, referring to the common myth that you could accidentally blow up a gas station with a cellphone.

He said it’s not the cellphone, but static sparks created when drivers rub themselves on the car that cause most of these fires. A lot of times, the drivers talk on their phones when the spark happens, so it just looks as if the cellphone is the cause of the fire, when it’s actually irrelevant.
“When you’re moving in and out of your car, you’re generating static electricity. If you feel a spark, that’s usually between 10 and 20,000 volts of static electricity—and that’s plenty strong enough to make gas fume,” he said.
In fact, this is something the cellphone industry acknowledges, too. According to an ABC report , two industry studies have concluded there’s no evidence that cellphones are a hazard around gasoline. Instead, it notes drivers should avoid static fires.
Savage said his show might have actually helped raise awareness of this problem. Since that episode aired nearly 10 years ago, the American Petroleum Institute told him, “the number of fires at gas stations has dropped by two-thirds.”

Sonia Gandhi expresses shock at Patna stampededeathPrint
Press Trust of India | Posted: October 3, 2014 10:11 pm | Updated: October 3, 2014 10:13 pm
Congress President Sonia Gandhi tonight expressed “shock and grief” over the deaths and injuries in a stampede in Patna.
“Dismayed at the unfortunate incident, Gandhi expressed the hope that the injured are being adequately attended to and conveyed her condolences to the families of those who passed away,” a Congress statement said here.
Thirty two people, most of them women and children, were killed and several injured in a stampede that broke out this evening at the Gandhi Maidan in the Bihar capital shortly after the Dussehra celebrations there.
The tragedy occurred when people were returning after watching the “Ravan Vadh” ceremony where a huge crowd had gathered to witness the event, police said.
Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also expressed sadness at the incident and attacked the JD(U) government in Bihar for allegedly failing to put in place measures to prevent the tragedy.
He said similar incidents had taken place during Chhatt puja in Bihar but the state government has “failed to learn lessons.”
Paswan, MP from Bihar, will be visiting the state tomorrow to take stock of the situation.
JD (U) chief Sharad Yadav assured the state government headed by his party will probe the incident and take action against those responsible for failing to take adequate precautionary measures.
Expressing sorrow at the tragedy, Yadav said “the incident will be probed and those whose laxity and carelessness led to the tragedy will face strong action.”

How our brains trick us into ignoring movie stunt doublesBy Rachel Feltman October 3 Follow @rachelfeltman
Who knows what you've ignored today? (Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)
Our brains are constantly perceiving the world as more stable than it actually is. Consider this: Every time the light hits your face differently, you look a little different -- but people don't perceive you as having suddenly changed into someone else. In fact, they probably don't see your face as having "changed" at all. Without this neurological trick, the world would be a decidedly more confusing place.
But according to a study published Thursday in Current Biology , that mechanism -- which researchers have dubbed the "continuity field"-- can also steer us wrong, and have us convinced that two totally different faces or forms are the same.
"The brain is creating stability out of what's actually a very unstable system," said David Whitney , the senior study author and a University of California at Berkeley professor of psychology. His lab coined the continuity field term in a previous experiment. In that study, they observed the mechanism by which people meld similar looking objects together.
"When you're watching Harry Potter, you don't notice that his plain T-shirt changes to a Henley, for example," first author and doctoral candidate Alina Liberman said. "Your visual system is primed to see things as remaining stable. You have a bias towards ignoring small changes in your environment."
This new study found the same bias in faces, which are obviously more complex -- and more important -- than T-shirts.
Liberman showed her subjects faces -- one every six seconds -- that varied in similarity to each other. After a brief shot of the face, they'd be shown a series of faces that got closer and closer to the one they'd just seen. But the subjects favored morphed faces halfway between their two previous target faces over the previously seen face on its own.
In other words, the subjects were primed to believe that the two faces they'd seen at such close intervals had been the same person, and were quick to "recognize" a morphed face that supported that perception. So we don't just ignore Harry Potter's obvious wardrobe goofs -- we ignore the brief appearances of his stunt double, too.
"If you see two faces in the span of about 10 seconds," Liberman said, "You expect them to look the same."
And thank goodness we do. "It's a way of smoothing our perception of people," Whitney said. "Without this mechanism, we'd experience fluctuations in identity." We'd have trouble recognizing someone as a single individual when they moved their face or moved into a different light.
With that Twilight Zone-esque alternative on the table, I happily forgive my brain for tripping up on sneaky movie cuts.

American Sniper movie trailer releasedBy Dan Lamothe October 3 Follow @danlamothe
In "American Sniper," directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the autobiography of the name, Bradley Cooper plays U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, who is said to have had the most confirmed kills in U.S. military history. Kyle struggled with PTSD and was killed at a gun range by a fellow veteran in February 2013. (Warner Bros. UK)
The first trailer for the highly anticipated and somewhat controversial “American Sniper” has been released, giving viewers their first look as actor Bradley Cooper playing Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who is billed as the sniper with the most confirmed kills in U.S. military history.
The movie is based on a best-selling book by the same name. It will likely depict some of the intense combat and sacrifice that Kyle saw during multiple deployments to Iraq, and his struggle to adjust to life at home in between. Kyle was shot to death on a Texas gun range in 2013, allegedly by a Marine veteran he was trying to help through post-traumatic stress.
In July, a Minnesota jury awarded $1.845 million in damages to former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura, deciding that he was defamed by Kyle for saying that he punched out Ventura in a bar in 2006 for saying that the SEALs “deserved to lose a few” in combat.
Kyle did not name the governor by name, but said he swung at a celebrity after he “started running his mouth about the war and everything and anything he could connect to it.” He later identified him as Ventura in interviews.
The reaction to the jury’s decision was extremely polarized, with some saying Ventura should have dropped his lawsuit after Kyle died and other saying the sniper shouldn’t have included inaccuracies in his book. The Kyle family has stood by the facts in the book.

Though exports have helped boost the economic recovery since the 2008 financial crisis, American elites worry that growing populism, driven by fears of lost wages exploited by opportunistic politicians, is a major barrier for the US effort to ink major international trade deals.
“Most Americans believe trade is going to hurt them,” John Veihmeyer, the chairman of the auditors KPMG International, said. “Joe Public on the street has heard the soundbite,” Irene Dorner, the CEO of HSBC USA, said. “People are running for cover,” Jon Huntsman, the former US Ambassador to China, added. “If we were to take any kind of vote on Capital Hill, I’m not sure it’ll pass. I’m not sure we’d be able to do what we’d done in the past, where there was kind of a bipartisan consensus. I’m not sure that exists.”
These leaders in business and politics had gathered at an event organized by HSBC, a bank that finances 10% of global trade. The bank’s executives have been barnstorming the country, trying to whip up support for new trade deals with a coalition of Asian countries and the European Union.
Trade is win-win, they argue, and they have the charts to prove it, thanks to analysis by the Dartmouth economist Matt Slaughter—US exports have doubled in absolute terms since 2003, trade companies pay 15 to 30% higher wages, the elimination of barriers to trade has boosted US national income by 10 percentage points annually. Those gathered at the event in Washington, DC seemed baffled at the idea that anyone might regret free trade deals—and they blamed misinformation.
“People have internalized the benefits of free trade so much,” Honest Tea CEO Seth Goldman said, adding that Americans may not know it. After all, he couldn’t make his beverages without importing tea grown abroad, and there’s no iPhone without a global supply chain.
But all of this does some injustice to the American people’s intelligence. According to recent polls , 68% agree that “trade” is a good thing for the economy, but many more are skeptical that it creates jobs (just 20% believe it does) or raises wages (only 17%).
For all the talk of exports growth, a fuller story compares looks at both exports and net exports, as the chart below does: For about a decade from 1996 to 2006—the period coinciding with the introduction of the North American Free Trade Agreement and trade liberalization with China—trade was a net drag on the the US economy as Americans purchased more goods and services abroad then they sold.

It’s no coincidence, some economists argue, that wages in sectors most affected by import have fallen—and indeed, they say that trade explains the bulk of wage reductions in the last 25 years. Trade has diffuse benefits for the entire economy, but very concentrated negative effects on a few key constituencies. At the event, Dorner observed that “if you’re here, you probably agree with us.” There was probably a similar consensus the other cities HSBC visited on its trade push: Los Angeles, where the film industry plans around Chinese distribution; San Francisco, home to the digital economy; Houston, a city built on the petroleum trade; and Chicago, the fourth-largest exporter in the country.
Not on HSBC’s itinerary: The rust belt cities of Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland, or South Carolina’s textile counties. And while the benefits of trade were touted at HSBC’s events, there was little discussion on how to help the people who absorb the negative impact.
Indeed, the system designed to address that problem—the US Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) policies set up to help displaced workers gain new skills and stay employed—is widely regarded as broken and ineffective. In this 2007 report , Slaughter suggests that the many parts of TAA be incorporated into the unemployment insurance system, and bolstered with relocation and retraining assistance. This is an agenda begging for an update.
And while the economic argument is perhaps the largest obstacle to new free trade deals, almost nothing was said about concerns that Americans may legitimately have about  opaque trade negotiations , provisions that might give multinational corporations unfair power over developing economies , or weak labor and environmental standards that leave Americans complicit in sweatshops and child labor . Nor does it touch on the complicated politics of currency manipulation, which will only become more important if the US dollar continues to strengthen.
None of that makes new trade deals a bad idea: It just means a bad trade deal is a bad idea. As Karan Bahtia, the top international lawyer at General Electric, observed, global growth trends mean that US economic sustainability “is going to depend on being more deeply engaged in the global markets.” After all, 95% of the world’s consumers live outside the United States.
But selling the American people—and American politicians—on the deal will require more than telling trade’s winners what they’ve already won. It’ll mean telling the losers what’s going to be different this time.

4 things Chase customers should do now4 things Chase customers should do right now
By Jose Pagliery   @Jose_Pagliery October 3, 2014: 1:15 PM ET
 
'Apple Pay' may be safer than plastic
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
If you're a Chase bank customer, you're right to feel powerless right now.
Hackers broke into JPMorgan's computer systems and stole more than 80 million customers' personal information, including their names, emails, physical addresses and phone numbers.
Anyone who used online banking or the Chase smartphone app were affected.
It's time to play defense.
1. Watch out for scammers. Hackers now have enough information to contact you, and they know you're a JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) customer.
Don't trust any phone calls, emails or letters claiming to be from the bank. Instead, directly call the number on your bank card or a previous statement.
Scam artists will seek even more information from you -- like your birthday, Social Security number or bank account number -- so they can tap into your account and steal your money.
And beware: Scammers will likely scan your Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ), Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) or LinkedIn ( LNKD , Tech30 ) page first. Expect them to sound like a bank that knows about your personal habits.
2. Don't change your login or get new cards -- yet. According to the bank, hackers didn't manage to steal usernames, passwords, account numbers or Social Security numbers.
As such, don't rush to change these things. It's an unnecessary inconvenience.
More importantly, though, you might have to change all these things later. The New York Times reported that hackers got root access to the bank's computer system. That's as deep as it gets.
So, hackers might still be lurking in the bank's computers -- even if the bank claims it closed the hole and has "no evidence" hackers are still inside its network.
 
Chase's 'ATM of the future'
3. Check your bank statement regularly. If hackers are still in the bank's computers, they could grab even more information.
Operate under the assumption you're at risk of fraud all the time. Carefully review your bank and credit card statements for any unexpected charges -- especially tiny ones.
Fraudsters typically test a stolen debit or credit card by charging a few cents on the card. They do it to avoid catching your attention.

What stopped stocks freefall this weekStocks stabilize as five shock absorbers kick in

The stock market stabilizes. (Sal Ruibal, USA TODAY)
Just when it looked like the U.S. stock market was going to crack amid the pressure of a new array of risks, it found its footing and stabilized thanks to a handful of factors that acted like shock absorbers for the market.
Just three days ago, on the first day of October, a month that spooks investors because of stock market crashes in October 1929 and 1987, stocks were in free fall. Wall Street was buzzing about how far stocks could fall — and whether the benchmark S&P 500-stock index was finally on a collision course with its first 10% drop, or correction, since late 2011.
The world — and the stock market — appeared in chaos and disarray as a confluence of scary headlines rattled the nerves of even the most ardent Wall Street bulls, prompting a 238-point plunge Wednesday in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong seemed on the verge of spinning out of control. The U.S. announced its first-ever diagnosis of Ebola on home soil. The small-cap Russell 2000 stock index — a bull market leader the past five years — fell 10% below its early March all-time high and into official “correction” territory. And weak manufacturing readings in Germany and the rest of the eurozone sparked fears of a global growth slowdown.
Fast-forward to today and the stock market appears far more stable, with stocks turning sharply higher amid fresh signs that the U.S. labor market — and the broader economy — may be in solid shape after all.
In early trading Friday, the Dow was up more than 140 points to 16,941, after climbing as much as 150 points earlier in the session. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.9% to 1964 and the Nasdaq was up 1.2% to 4483.
What caused the tone of the market to flip from bearish to bullish virtually overnight? Here are five factors that have acted as shock absorbers for the fragile market at a pivotal time.
1. Blowout jobs report. Any concerns that the U.S. job-creation machine was stalling out went by the wayside Friday when the government released its September jobs report.
The U.S. economy created 248,000 jobs last month, topping forecasts of 215,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The unemployment rate declined to 5.9% — the lowest level since July 2008 — and better than the 6.1% forecast.
The government also revised up the weak August jobs report to 180,000 jobs from 142,000, and July job gains to 243,000 from 212,000. However, worker pay didn’t budge, as average hourly wage gains were unchanged. That signals that wage inflation remains tame, which is a bullish sign for stocks as it gives the Federal Reserve some ammunition to argue that speeding up the timetable for interest rate hikes might not be necessary, despite the strong reading on the labor market.
The upbeat jobs report also shows that the economy is not falling off a cliff and is still strong enough to support solid corporate earnings growth despite slowdowns in Europe and China.
“This morning there is a sigh of relief on both Wall Street and Main Street,” says Sung Won Sohn, a finance professor at California State University CI. “The jobs slowdown in August was an aberration and the economy is back on a healthier growth trajectory.”
2. Hong Kong protests don’t cause meltdown. The pro-democracy protests have not spiraled out of control, despite the ongoing standoff between the China-backed Hong Kong government and protesters. In fact, the size of the street protests appeared to be dwindling Friday after the Hong Kong government agreed to talks with the protesters. What’s more, the key Hang Seng stock index rose 0.6% to 23,064.56 Friday after steep selloffs earlier in the week and after markets were closed for two days for holidays tied to China’s independence 65 years ago.
Investors viewed both developments in Asia as a sign that the protests might not spiral out of control as feared and morph into an economic crisis.
3. Small-cap stocks rebound. Market pessimism peaked Wednesday when the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index closed down more than 10% from its March 4 record high of 1208.65, putting it into official correction territory. However, the small-cap index mounted a 1% rebound Thursday and is up another 1% today.
The rebound in what is considered a proxy for risk-taking on Wall Street suggests that the buy-the-dip mentality on Wall Street is not dead. It also downplayed fears that the small-cap selloff was going to drag down the broader market.
4. Ebola, a scare, but not a crisis. The first diagnosed case of the deadly Ebola virus in the U.S. has dragged down shares of airlines and other travel-related stocks, but Wall Street is still not treating the scare as a major economic crisis — at least not yet. Markets typically don’t sell off sharply unless there is a clear sign that a health-related epidemic has real, lasting negative economic impact.
5. Seasonally strong time of year. The stock market is heading into its strongest seasonal three-month and six-month periods of the year, so investors are giving the market the benefit of the doubt for now. The bulls on Wall Street still argue that the economy and labor market are strong, which should translate into solid performance for corporate profitability, a key underpinning of the stock market rally the past five years.

The U.S. is now on the World Health Organizations Ebola Response RoadmapBy J. Freedom du Lac October 3 Follow @jfdulac
Through the beginning of October, there have been 7,491 probable, confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola in West Africa, according to the latest " Ebola Response Roadmap " from the World Health Organization.
But the worldwide number is higher: For the first time during the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, the WHO has included the United States on the "Ebola Response Roadmap," including the single case from Texas in its update.
According to the WHO's update, which was released Friday, the Ebola death toll is up to 3,439 in West Africa. All but eight of the deaths came in the Ebola-ravaged nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. (The others were in Nigeria, where the outbreak may be coming to an end .)
The number of U.S. Ebola cases remained at one through early Friday afternoon, even as health officials in Texas said that "approximately 10 people" who had contact with the Ebola patient in Dallas are considered higher risk. Also on Friday, Howard University Hospital in Washington said that a patient was being evaluated after coming to the facility "presenting symptoms that could be associated with Ebola."

Judging America  Photo Series Captures Nation s Stereotypesreddit
Terrorist. Gangster. Stripper. Landscaper.
When people are viewed as stereotypes, they're labeled on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Photographer Joel Parés , a U.S. Marine from Puerto Rico, sought to highlight these prejudices in his new series, " Judging America ."
"My inspiration for this series is the fact that America is a country that is very diverse with many ethnicities that together create the United States of America," he told photography blog Fstoppers.
Parés has observed stereotyping throughout his lifetime, like when his twin brother was bullied for being a "nerd" as a child, or when his friends from India were called "terrorists" and taunted with phony Middle Eastern accents while he was stationed in the South during his stint in the Marine Corps.
"It hurt me to see all of these things happening, so I decided that I would use my photography as my voice crying out for change," he told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. "My goal is to open the eyes of those who judge and let them see that it is wrong, and they need to get to know someone before they begin to label them under a certain category."
For the series, Parés photographed each subject twice. One photo shows the subject dressed to mimic a stereotype, and the other shows the subject as he or she really is.
"[M]any of us judge incorrectly by someone’s ethnicity, by their profession and by their sexual interest," he also told HuffPost. "The purpose of this series is to open our eyes and make us think twice before judging someone, because we all judge, even if we try not to. The first image is not necessarily what you actually see, but it is what you categorize them in your head without knowing who they truly are. The second image explains the truth about the person and how incorrect they were judged initially [all sic]."
Parés has experience in front of the camera, having worked as a model, according to Fstoppers. However, he is passionate about working behind the camera because he loves the possibility of "telling a story in a unique way, a way that can inspire the world," he told the photography blog.

Women wearing jeans is against Indian culture: YesudasUpdated: October 4, 2014 01:42 IST
Yesudas strikes a sour note with comments on women’s attire

TOPICS
social issues (general)
“What should be covered must be covered. Women should not trouble others by wearing jeans,” K.J. Yesudas, musician, said here on Friday, inviting protests from political leaders, women’s groups and the public.
He was speaking at the inauguration of the Gandhi Jayanthi cleanliness drive at the Sri Swathi Thirunal College of Music here.
When women wear jeans, people are tempted to pay attention to what is beyond it, thus forcing them to do undesirable things, the well-known singer said. “They [women] should not try to become like men but must behave modestly,” he continued. The attire, he said, is unbecoming of Indian culture and what lends beauty to a woman is her demureness.
While the programme went ahead without protests, women’s groups took out marches later in the city. “Utterly tasteless and unworthy of such a great cultural artist,” was how CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat reacted when The Hindu spoke to her on Friday. “A person of his stature should be standing on the side of women in their fight against violence instead of putting his weight behind those justifying the violence and blaming them for the dress they wear,” she said while asking Mr. Yesudas to withdraw his statements immediately. Activist K. Ajitha said the acclaimed singer had acted like a typical male chauvinist. “It is now well accepted that the sexist attitude of male was behind rape and not the dress code of women,” she said while observing that the comment only betrayed the sexist streak in the singer.
Noted writer Sara Joseph said there was something wrong with the mindset of people who found fault with the way women dressed. “Jeans are a globally accepted outfit and there is nothing wrong in wearing it,” she said. Shooting holes in Mr. Yesudas’s argument against jeans by linking it to morality and culture, Ms. Joseph noted that the dress was widely used by women in the United States, where the singer spent much of his time. .
Film-maker Geetu Mohandas, whose debut feature film Liar’s Dice is the country’s official entry for the 87th Academy Awards, was cautious in her reaction while staying clear of “mindless blaming of a well-respected and gifted individual”. “But I would like to say that every citizen in our democratic country has the freedom and right to wear a dress of their choice,” she said.
The singer’s comments found an echo on social networking websites with sentiments ranging from deep disappointment and outrage to support for his freedom of expression
An unfortunate fallout of the social media outrage saw his daughters-in-law being dragged into the controversy, with users uploading photographs of them in jeans captioned with a question on the singer’s “hypocrisy”.

No doubt that on Monday, when Indian leader Narendra Modi visits the White House, he and President Obama will try to stick to the agenda: economic and security cooperation, India’s relations with Pakistan and China, and how the world’s two largest democracies can build better ties. But the media in both countries probably won’t let them forget that not long ago, it wasn’t clear whether Modi could even enter the United States, much less be received at America’s most powerful address
Prime Minister Modi, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept into power in the spring, was denied a U.S. visa for the last nine years because of suspicions around his role in anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat state in 2002, when he was chief minister there. But he’s not the only foreign leader blocked from coming to the United States. On the contrary, the U.S. has long used access to its shores as a political cudgel.
The most famous example is probably the Reagan administration’s 1988 decision to bar Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat from attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York City. Nowadays, Arafat is remembered mostly for his statesmanship and that historic handshake with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn in 1993. But Americans regarded Arafat with more suspicion in the 1980s.

The United States is obligated to admit foreign nationals to travel to the United Nations under the 1947 U.N. Headquarters Agreement, which based the organization in New York City. But American governments have maintained that they can make exceptions for people considered to be a threat to national security. In a statement explaining the Reagan White House’s rationale for refusing Arafat a visa, then-Secretary of State George Shultz explained: “U.S. law excludes members of the P.L.O. from entry into the United States by virtue of their affiliation in an organization which engages in terrorism.”
U.N. members roundly criticized the decision. Only the United States and Israel voted against a resolution condemning the decision, and the body ultimately convened its General Assembly in Geneva in protest.
Similar moves by the U.S. have provoked less backlash.
The George W. Bush administration considered denying a visa to then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, before his first trip to New York in 2005, but decided to grant it. The fire-breathing Iranian leader thanked the administration with a predictably incendiary speech to the assembled dignitaries. In 2012, the Obama administration barred 20 of roughly 160 Iranian officials from attending the U.N. General Assembly with him.
Earlier this year, the White House decided to block the new Iranian government’s nominee for U.N. ambassador, Hamid Aboutalebi, from entering the United States because of his involvement in the 1979 takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran and ensuing hostage crisis.
Obama has also used visa bans against close associates of Vladimir Putin as part the U.S. punishment for Russia’s increasing aggression in Ukraine. Other Russian leaders are blocked from traveling to the United States under a law, the Magnitsky Act, that Congress passed in 2012 in response to blatant human rights violations in the country.
Modi may have his election and India’s status as a world power to thank for the U.S. dropping his travel shackles. But being lumped in that kind of company isn’t a great foundation for a blossoming bilateral friendship.

JPMorgan hack exposed data of 83 million  among biggest breaches in history0
News of the actions by the states emerged a day after the bank said in a regulatory filing that customer names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses were taken in the attack that the bank said surfaced in August. It added that it was continuing to investigate the matter and that customers would not be liable for any unauthorized transactions that were promptly reported to the bank.
When asked to comment on the investigations, JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said the company was careful not to speak more about the breach until it had “complete information.”
She said that, given the fact that no account information was taken, the bank was not legally required to disclose as much as it has.
FRAUD WARNING
However, cybercrime experts warned that the hack could fuel years of fraud, as criminals use the stolen data to "phish" for customer passwords and ferret out other consumer accounts.
The bank said it has not seen any rise in fraud in the wake of the discoveries, but security researchers said the information that hackers stole, such as addresses, tends to change relatively slowly, which gives criminals a long time to use it.
Their first step will likely be to use the information to send emails to customers purporting to be from JPMorgan Chase. Links embedded in those emails could be used to con customers out of their passwords, a practice known as "phishing."
"Hackers might send out emails saying 'Your JPMorgan Chase account has been breached, please log into our portal and enter your information,'" said Alex Holden, chief executive of Hold Security, a cybersecurity firm that monitors trade in stolen credentials.
The bank's letter to account holders on its website on Friday made no mention of "phishing," but it linked to a "frequently asked questions" document whose last answer warned about "phishing." Wexler said the bank is making the warning more prominent on its website.
"The risk is phishing" Wexler said, adding that people should be on the lookout. She said that there was no evidence that account numbers, passwords, user IDs, birthdays, or Social Security numbers were taken.
The stolen data is likely to end up being sold on underground cybercrime exchanges to fraudsters who will use it for "phishing" and other schemes. Holden said it is likely to be broken up into groups based on categories such as zip codes, with wealthy demographics going for higher rates. He estimates that lots of varying sizes would sell for between $1,000 and $15,000, with each of them being resold multiple times.
Such information can be used to craft "phishing" emails to seek other types of online accounts, beyond the initial firm that was breached, particularly when combined with personal details from social networking sites such as Facebook , Google , LinkedIn and Twitter, security researchers warned. Details from social media profiles can provide criminals with rich information that they can use to craft convincing "phishing" emails, including information about family, friends, education and work.
"Social media helps the criminals pursue their trade," said Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner for specialist operations for London's Metropolitan Police.
JPMorgan's Wexler said that the bank is not offering credit monitoring to customers because no financial information, account data or personally identifiable information was compromised.
JPMorgan disclosed at the end of August that it had hired outside forensics experts to help it investigate a possible cyberattack.
The bank said in April that it expects to spend more than $250 million on cybersecurity this year, with about 1,000 people focused on the area. The bank's efforts will grow exponentially in the coming years, it added.

Gujarat refuses to permit SIT plea challenging Maya Kodnanis bailPress Trust of India | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 3, 2014 9:27 pm
The Gujarat Government has refused permission to the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team to challenge the bail given to former Minister Maya Kodnani in a post-Godhra riot case.
Kodnani, who was given bail by Gujarat High Court, was convicted in the Naroda Patia riot case – in which 97 people were killed – and awarded 28-year jail term by the trial court.
“We have taken a decision of not granting permission to SIT to file an appeal before the Supreme Court to challenge bail to Kodnani on the basis of some past judgements of the apex court,” Law and Justice Secretary V P Patel said.
Kodnani, who handled Women and Child Development portfolio in the then Narendra Modi Cabinet, was granted bail by the High Court on July 30 on health grounds.
Prashant Desai, Special Public Prosecutor representing SIT, said the State Government had sought his opinion on challenging Kodnani’s bail in the apex court.
“When Mayaben Kodnani was granted bail by the High Court, the State Government sought my opinion on whether or not to file an appeal in the Supreme Court.
“Looking into the situation and facts of the case, I was of the opinion that there is a remote chance of success. Despite my opinion, the Gujarat Government has all the authority to go to the Supreme Court,” Desai maintained.
The HC had granted bail to the former MLA considering her submission that she suffered from acute depression and tuberculosis, for which she is being treated at Ahmedabad City Civil Hospital.
Kodnani’s sentence was also suspended till her appeal against the trial court order is disposed by the High Court. Kodnani, who was convicted as a ‘kingpin’ of the massacre, was sentenced to a 28-year jail term by a special trial court in Naroda Patia area of Ahmedabad city, and she became the first convict in the Naroda Patia case to get regular bail from the Gujarat High Court.
The three-time legislator was also the first woman to be convicted in a post-Godhra riots case.
Kodnani, who was a BJP MLA representing Naroda at the time of the 2002 riots, was made Minister of State for Women and Child Development in the 2007 Narendra Modi-led Gujarat cabinet.
However, Kodnani had to resign after her arrest in the case in March 2009.
In August 2012, a special SIT court had awarded life imprisonment to then BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi and 29 others for their roles in the 2002 riots in Ahmedabad at Naroda Patia.
The massacre had taken place a day after the Godhra train burning incident of February 27, 2002.
The Naroda Patia massacre case is one of the nine cases investigated by the Supreme Court appointed SIT which probed Godhra and post-Godhra riots in the year 2002.

Patna stampede: At least 32 killed  15 injured during Dussehra celebration at Gandhi MaidanAn injured woman is carried on a stretcher to a hospital for treatment in Patna, India on Friday, (Source: PTI)

At least 32 people have been  killed in a stampede during the Dussehra celebration at Gandhi Maidan in Patna.  More than 15 people have been injured in the incident.
The tragedy occurred when people were returning after watching the “Ravan Vadh” ceremony at the Bihar capital’s main Dussehra event at Gandhi Maidan where a huge crowd had gathered to witness the event, police said.
“Thirty-three people have died,” Bihar Home Secretary Amir Subhani said.
Officials said the dead were mainly women and children.

According to the Patna DM Manish Kumar Verma the injured have been rushed to Patna Medical College Hospital.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the Bihar Chief Minister to enquire about the stampede. He sanctioned Rs 2 lakh each for the next of those killed.
“Amongst the dead, there were 5-6 children and around 20 women,” according to Patna District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma.

Principal Secretary Home Amir Subhani said that one more person died on Saturday, taking the toll to 33. Twenty-nine others were injured of whom the condition of four patients was stated to be critical, Subhani said.
Of the 29 injured admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), 17 are women and 12 are men, he said.
Subhani, who along with Additional Director General of Police (Headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey has been appointed to inquire into the stampede incident, said he would begin the probe with a visit to the spot at Gandhi Maidan at noon.
The incident happened at the Exhibition Road area near Gandhi Maidan in the heart of the city, as some people in the crowd started jostling with each other to move forward, eyewitnesses said.
The police have blocked the entry of people to the stretch now.
Some eyewitnesses said that panic broke out following rumours that a live electric wire had fallen to the ground. Slippers, shoes and footwear were seen strewn on a 500 metre stretch as people tried to flee from the scene.

Airlines & the Ebola outbreakairlines & the ebola outbreak
Patient in isolation at Maryland hospital with Ebola-like symptomsBy Elahe Izadi , Susan Svrluga and Abby Ohlheiser October 3 Follow @ElaheIzadi Follow @SusanSvrluga Follow @abbyohlheiser
Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)
UPDATE: The District of Columbia Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday that they have ruled out Ebola for the patient at Howard University Hospital.
EARLIER STORY: Two Washington area hospitals said within hours of each other Friday that they had each admitted a patient with symptoms and travel histories associated with Ebola.
A person who had recently traveled to Nigeria came to Howard University Hospital in the District overnight "presenting symptoms that could be associated with Ebola," spokeswoman Kerry-Ann Hamilton said in a statement.
"In an abundance of caution, we have activated the appropriate infection control protocols, including isolating the patient," she said. "Our medical team continues to evaluate and monitor progress in close collaboration with the CDC and the Department of Health."
Just hours later, Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Md., north of Washington, confirmed that it was evaluating a patient who "presented with flu-like symptoms and a travel history that matches criteria for possible Ebola."
But on Friday night, Shady Grove Adventist officials said they had ruled out Ebola. "Our medical team has determined that the patient has malaria and does not have Ebola," the hospital said in a statement.
While Ebola continues to devastate West African nations including Liberia and Sierra Leone, the outbreak in Nigeria – where the Howard patient had traveled – may actually be coming to an end , with no new cases since Aug. 31, the CDC reported earlier this week. At one point, 894 people in Nigeria were being monitored since they had come into contact with someone sick with Ebola.

Overall, the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history has killed at least 3,439 people in West Africa and infected thousands more, according to the World Health Organization.
But before an Ebola case was confirmed in Dallas this week, there had not been a single Ebola diagnosis in the United States.
Potential Ebola patients who were evaluated in New York , California , New Mexico and Miami all tested negative for the virus.

People with Ebola are not contagious until they begin showing symptoms, which include a fever of greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, severe headache and vomiting. And you can only get Ebola through contact with a contagious person's bodily fluids.
Several Ebola patients have been transported from West Africa to the United States, including three Americans who were in Liberia — doctors Richard Sacra and Kent Brantly and missionary worker Nancy Writebol — who have already been discharged after they were successfully treated here. A Liberian American, Patrick Sawyer, fell ill after traveling to Nigeria and died of the disease.
The NIH in Bethesda recently admitted an American patient who had been exposed to Ebola.
On Thursday night, NBC News announced that a freelance cameraman working for the network in Liberia has tested positive for Ebola and will return to the United States for treatment.
In Maryland, all health providers and labs are required to report suspected Ebola cases to the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene immediately, said spokesman Christopher Garrett. The state agency works with local health departments to ensure that proper procedures, including isolation, are followed; information has been distributed to hospitals, nursing homes, labs and other providers.
Officials at several local hospitals said they have been following CDC guidelines. At the University of Virginia Health System, an emerging-infectious-diseases work group was formed earlier this year to respond to MERS; this summer, that group began preparedness planning for the possibility of Ebola infections.
The system has already been tested; the University of Virginia Health System has had one patient who met CDC criteria for Ebola screening, based on travel history, fever and other symptoms.
"We confirmed that concern with public health authorities and went through the formal process of admitting and evaluating that person for Ebola,” said Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology, infection prevention and control. “We ruled out the possibility of Ebola.”

LIC gets Rs. 11 500cr in I-T refunds  policy holders to benefitinsurance
Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has received more than Rs. 11,500 crore in income tax refunds and a big chunk of the amount would be passed on to policyholders, an official said.
“We received I-T refunds in two tranches aggregating to more than Rs. 11,500 crore, after winning a dispute with the I-T department at the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT),” an LIC official, who wished not to be named, told PTI here today, adding that this refund happens to be the largest which the company has received so far.
This could not be ascertained with LIC Chairman S.K. Roy.
A text message sent to him also remained unanswered.
In its order dated April 3, 2013, ITAT Mumbai had delivered a judgment in favour of LIC with respect to assessment years 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10, the official said.
As a result of the above ITAT judgment, the LIC received a refund of Rs. 4,190.19 crore for assessment years (AY) 2007-08 and 2009-10 on December 31, 2013. A refund for AY 2008-09 worth Rs. 7,500 crore has been received by the LIC recently, the official said.
As per Section 26 of the LIC Act of 1956, 95 per cent of the surplus coming from I-T refunds ought to go to its policyholders, while the remaining 5 per cent has to be paid to the government in the form of dividend, after arriving at actuarial valuation at the close of the current fiscal year, the LIC official said.
LIC has paid advance income tax for the financial year 2013-14 (AY2014-15) to the tune of Rs. 5,118.92 crore, as against Rs. 4,323.99 crore in 2012-13 (AY2013-14). LIC's service tax obligations for FY14 was Rs. 4,022.40 crore (provisional) as against Rs. 3,682.58 crore in FY13, he said.

Nancy McIntyre on leveling the playing field0
I continued to support robotics programs at school and finally made my way to the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation, a nonprofit focused on engaging students in robotics engineering programs around the world. Once I was in a position to see how these events work across the globe, I noticed a recurring theme: that there were always many fewer girls in attendance than boys. I knew that the girls competing were just as good as good as the boys. So after one recent trip, I decided I wanted to help level the playing field.
A light bulb went off. I knew one thing I could do was develop a comprehensive approach to increase the number of all-girls robotics teams in my home state of California. I envisioned training sessions where girls could work alongside women engineers who could mentor them through robotics competitions. I envisioned providing insights to teachers on ways to foster girls' interest in robotics, and to show them what girls can contribute to these teams when they are included and encouraged. And most of all, I envisioned hosting an event where all of the girls' teams would come together to compete, and also to bond by sharing their experiences with women leaders and to network with their own peers.
I envisioned all this — and now I'm doing it. The Robotics Education and Competition Foundation program began in earnest just a few short weeks ago. I secured the support of local schools, and I am so proud to hold our launch event. I will welcome 50 to 100 girls, teachers and mentors to begin designing, building and working together to participate in the current VEX Robotics Competition season. I want to empower and inspire female engineers — and help to bring up the next generation of brilliant women in robotics.
I am so excited to get started. As I embark on this goal, I'm reminded of a line of a poem I recently discovered: "You ask, 'What if I fail?' But, oh, my darling, what if you fly?"

How different is the current bull marketHow different is the current bull market?
N Sundaresha Subramanian & Puneet Wadhwa | New Delhi Oct 03, 2014 12:58 AM IST
"A client asked me, 'the dollar is nearing an all-time high against the euro. It will be good for technology stocks in the long run, right?' I simply said 'yes, sir'. What else could one say," asks Harish Vasudevan, a Mumbai-based stock broker. The current stock market rally is seeing a very different kind of small investor, he says. "They Google search. They give you more information about a company than even the promoter. They talk to five people before they buy 100 shares."
The e-commerce generation is learning to buy shares like they buy clothes and mobile phones - after thorough research.
This was not so when the country saw its previous bull market. Though the internet was around, people would trust their brokers and relationship managers for information. "In those days, even for buying 5,000 shares, people would not talk to more than one person," he recalls.
Brokers like Vasudevan are struggling to keep themselves in tune with this super-informed, new-generation retail investor. True, an informed investor is just what the doctor ordered for a strong bull market. But it may still be too early to say if informed choices will necessarily turn out to be multibaggers.
Similar to the 2004 rally
The current one is an election year that saw a Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance government taking charge at the Centre in May. According to data compiled by Business Standard Research Bureau, the Sensex gained 11 per cent over the period between May 15 and September 30 this year. This jump was less than a third of that seen during the same period in 2009, the previous election year which brought the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) under Manmohan Singh back to power. That year, recovering from the post-Lehman Brothers crisis, the index had gained 37 per cent. By comparison, in the corresponding period of 2004, the election year in which UPA had come to power for the first time, the Sensex had gained only nine per cent from its 5,000 level. However, the index went on to rise four times over the following three years.
This year, the performance of smaller stocks has largely been proportionate with the blue-chip ones. While the BSE Mid-cap and Small-cap indices have gained 24.74 per cent and 37.10 per cent, these had, respectively, clocked 63.5 per cent and 74.1 per cent in 2009. In 2004, the gains for these indices were 17.5 per cent and 28.5 per cent, respectively. Besides the range of returns, there are several other parellels that people are drawing between now and 2004.
Ambit Investment Advisors Chief Executive Andrew Holland says: "In 2004, first there were expectations of high GDP (gross domestic product) growth, then earnings growth began accelerating. And, in turn, markets started to play catch-up. I think, at present, we are in a phase similar to the 2003-2006 period." The Sensex can double from its current level over the next three years, he says. Not everyone, though, seems to share Holland's optimism.
A sagging Reliance
In 2009, while all 30 Sensex stocks were in the green in the first few months of a new government taking charge, there is no such luck this time. At least three big stocks have given negative returns since Modi was voted to power. While Reliance Industries Ltd's (RIL's) stock has lost the most (10 per cent), Bharat Heavy Electricals and Tata Power have also been losers. With 2.8 million small shareholders and hundreds of funds holding the stock in big chunks, RIL is a key sentiment driver. By comparison, Cipla, which has been the biggest gainer in this rally, has only 0.15 million small shareholders. Maruti Suzuki, the second-best performer, has only 95,751 small shareholders.
In its core area, RIL faces uncertainty over gas pricing. Also, its merger with Network18, which brings key synergies to its 4G telecom venture, is still awaiting regulatory approval. In 2004, though RIL was not among top gainers, it was not among top five losers, either.
"When Reliance is down, the broader sentiment gets affected, as a large number of people are yet to see money despite a Sensex rally. RIL has taken big bets, investing billions of dollars in retail and 4G - not its core areas. These stories take time to play out. The stock will pick up when clarity emerges," said a fund manager marketing a new fund offer.
The e-commerce theme
One sure and present threat to the retail sector, where Reliance Industries has spent significantly, comes from e-commerce. According to the fund manager quoted earlier, each big bull market has a defining theme, and every time this tends to be new. "In 1994-96, it was financial services; in 2004-07, it was real estate and infrastructure; my gut feeling is, it will be internet and e-commerce businesses this time." He points out, though there are few options for investors in the listed space, new companies will list and become key drivers of the bull market as it matures. "When a rally started in 2004, were there any listed real estate companies? Had you heard of a Purvankara? Still, see what happened by 2007," he says.
Vasudevan agrees that e-commerce is the next big thing. "It has picked up exceedingly well even in the Tier-II and -III centres. Entire stocks of cellphones vanish in seconds. It is a dream market for manufacturers. Once the speed increases with launch of 4G, there will be a big fundamental shift," he predicts.
Goldman Sachs analysts had said in a recent report, 'India's digital dividend': "India currently has about 25 million online buyers. That is only a 10th of the country's total internet user base of about of 252 million. We believe that lower broadband penetration and limited access to electronic payment systems are primarily responsible for such low internet buyers-to-user conversion rate. We believe the government's initiatives to expand the broadband connectivity and improvements in the retail ordering/distribution technologies would help improve this ratio. Given that e-commerce models like "marketplace" provide scale and reach for small businesses with very little investment, we believe investments in retail technology solutions could boost the productivity of the retail economy."
This report also said that the impact of internet and communication technology (ICT) on India was growing at an exponential rate. "There are already 900 million mobile phones and 250 million internet users in India, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. This is enabling a rapid flow of information, bringing people closer together, and allowing consumers to purchase virtually anything at any time. ICT is spurring innovation and entrepreneurship, and boosting productivity in all areas it touches."
'Corrections will be short-lived'
The Reserve Bank of India's decision to hold rates, amid fears of the US Federal Reserve raising those in the near future, has left the Street nonplussed. But expectation of quicker decisions and clearances from a tech-savvy Modi government has fuelled hopes of faster economic growth. This is key to higher corporate earnings growth, which would push up valuations.
S Naganath, president & chief investment officer, DSP BlackRock, expects India's annual GDP growth to accelerate to seven per cent in 2015, 2016 and beyond - even as many other emerging-market economies are expected to slow. "The growth is driven by implementing half-finished projects. Equity valuations are reasonable, earnings momentum looks set to take off and domestic investors are buying."
Naganath believes the Sensex has material upside over the next three years. "Any correction (a five per cent to 10 per cent decline is a possibility) are likely to be short-lived," he says.
Ambit's Holland says: "When the Nifty moved from the 7,600 level to around 8,200, I did not really want to chase the markets, because it was more driven by global liquidity than fundamentals. However, the market has retracted a bit from that level and may correct a bit more due to global factors. So, what we will see now is more of stock-picking than index-picking. That is how people will make money over the next two-three years."
Vasudevan, meanwhile, is busy reading reviews of different smartphones; he wants to replace his BlackBerry to keep in touch with his clients on popular chat application WhatsApp.

Why has the quality of spinners in India declinedTweet
0
Two years ago, when England won the Test series in India 2-1, R Ashwin, India's favoured offspinner since the dropping of Harbhajan Singh , took 14 wickets at 52.64. This summer in England, Ashwin played the final two Tests of the five-match series; Ravindra Jadeja played in the first four. Their combined aggregate of 12 wickets was seven fewer than the tally of the best spinner in the series: England's Moeen Ali, a part-timer.
On India's domestic circuit, spinners have ceded place to seamers. In the last three seasons of the Ranji Trophy, only Shahbaz Nadeem , the Jharkhand left-arm spinner, has finished among the top-five wicket-takers. Till the turn of the millennium, Ranji teams had high-quality spinners who were at par with those playing for the national side. Now, a country that boasted the likes of Erapalli Prasanna, Bishan Bedi, BS Chandrasekhar, Maninder Singh, Narendra Hirwani, Venkatapathy Raju, Anil Kumble, Sunil Joshi and Harbhajan Singh suddenly finds its pool dry.
What are the factors that have contributed to this decline? Five experts - Bishan Bedi, Maninder Singh, Narendra Hirwani, Murali Kartik and Amol Muzumdar - share their thoughts.
A lack of quality spin
Bishan Bedi (former India left-arm spinner and captain): Where is India's next-generation spinner coming from? We are at a very strange crossroads where everybody and anybody wants to get into the team in a fast manner. That does not happen when it comes to spin bowling. Spin bowling is all about learning your craft over a period of time. You can't learn spin bowling by just delivering four overs in a T20 match.
Murali Kartik : (former Railways and India left-arm spinner): We have come to a stage where even a part-time bowler is being looked at as a spinner. To bowl spin there are lots of important basics in technique that need to be developed. That is not happening right now because the youngsters at the grass-roots level are playing the limited-overs versions. Before you are learning what your action is, learning how to bowl the conventional form of spin, the thing that is happening now is, because of the lure of money, youngsters want to play the shortest format.
At the age of 18 or 19, if you ask a spinner to play T20 and then ask him to bowl well in four-day cricket, it will not be possible. Even within India, you are not getting spinners to bowl well, even if you give them spinning pitches. So they do not have the wherewithal to bowl at all overseas.
Amol Muzumdar: (former Mumbai batsman and captain) The spinners are not a threat anymore. When does a batsman feel threatened at the crease? Only when the ball has fizz. If you are darting the ball at him, I am happy [as a batsman], absolutely happy to face that. But when the ball fizzes off the surface, when it has flight and spin, then batting is not easy. And that is not seen anymore.
I remember facing Venkatapathy Raju in Mumbai in my early years of first-class cricket. I could hear the turn in the air. Same with Maninder Singh. That really put me in my crease. I told myself I had to be careful. They put me on the back foot.
Narendra Hirwani: (former India legspinner and former national selector) There was a time when the level of spinners at Ranji Trophy and Test level was virtually the same. That divide has become very big now. During Bishan paaji's time there were Padmakar Shivalkar and Rajinder Goel, who were equally good left-arm spinners.
Today the youngsters are a little too smart for their own good. When you become too smart, you become cautious. But these youngsters do not understand that every batsman is afraid of spin.
Maninder Singh: (fomer India left-arm spinner) This is a concern. The BCCI did not either realise or it did not bother to make sure young spinners coming up did not start drifting towards T20 cricket. I will give the example of Akshar Patel, the Kings XI Punjab [and Gujarat] left-arm spinner. He darts everything in to the batsman, which is absolutely fine for T20, but I hope it does not become a habit.
The part pitches play
Kartik: It was a knee-jerk reaction [making green pitches] when we lost Test series in England and Australia in 2011 and 2012. The thought process was we needed to play on wickets which are conducive to fast bowling.
In India, say I win the toss on a green pitch and ask the opposition to bat. I play three seamers, a batting allrounder who can bowl a little, and a spinner. Generally, if you bundle out the opposition anywhere between 120-220 runs, the next thing you do is you ask for a heavy roller when it is your turn to bat. So over four innings, by the time the match is into the third day and when the wicket is supposed to disintegrate, because the heavy roller has been used, the wicket is no longer green for the seamers. It becomes a flat deck. And because of the grass cover that has been rolled time and again, there are no natural variations, there are no footmarks. So even on the fourth day there is nothing for a spinner.
Also, the SG Test ball, which is used in domestic first-class cricket, starts [reverse] swinging once the ball is 30 to 40 overs old. By the time the spinner comes in to bowl the ball is about 60 overs old. But he gets only about ten overs to do the holding job on a pitch made for the seamers.
I bowled a total of 71 overs during the 2013-14 season in seven matches for Railways. Out of that, for ten overs I ran in and bowled seam-up against Tamil Nadu at the Jamia Millia ground in Delhi. At times we have played on pitches that resembled the Wimbledon tennis courts.
I can still bowl on those wickets because I have bowled in the conventional four-day method. Harbhajan Singh has done that. [Ramesh] Powar has done that. Sunil Joshi has done that. But Ravindra Jadeja , Iqbal Abdulla, Vishal Dabholkar have learned only the restrictive way of bowling: round-arm, undercutting. That is what is happening closer to the grass-roots.
Making spin-friendly pitches is no foolproof solution. By doing that the spinner goes in with a false sense of confidence that he has taken lots of wickets. But you are still not a complete bowler. Your skill sets are not up to the mark.
Hirwani: I have always said that a spinner should train on a wicket where he needs to make the ball turn. Not on pitches that take turn easily. It should be a pitch where you need the skills - not everyone can spin on it.
A defensive attitude
Bedi: There is no imagination. You are only playing a waiting game. So the batsman will always be on top. You have to make a batsman do what you want him to do. Spin bowling is a philosophy. How to outwit your opponent. It can be compared with playing chess. It is not bowling flat, like young Indian bowlers, even Jadeja, are doing.
Hirwani: I feel the main reason behind that is if the idea is to minimise the runs I want to concede, I need to not reduce the spin on the ball. If you spin less, then you could give less runs, but you also reduce the chances of taking a wicket. So if you minimise taking risks, you also cut down your chances of taking a wicket. The shorter versions of the game have started affecting some spinners.
Take even Harbhajan Singh . Why did he slide in the latter half of his career? He started to focus more on checking the runs. His line started to go towards the middle stump and that reduced his chances of taking wickets. An attacking line for an offspinner is pitching on the fifth stump [outside off], where he is trying to get the batsman bowled by breaking in. The moment he brings the line inside, he starts becoming defensive. That means only if the batsman makes a mistake will you get a wicket. But then how are you forcing the batsman to commit a mistake?
My message to even senior spinners like R Ashwin is: bowl your stock delivery 80% of the time in first-class cricket, and for rest of the time you can use the variations as a surprise. A spinner should not become predictable.
Kartik: Even in first-class cricket, spinners and captains now place a long-on, long-off, deep point with silly point and short leg, when all you are doing is darting the ball. To dart you do not need to know the fundamentals of spin bowling. To bowl flight, to beat the batsman in the air, to spin the ball, you need the basics to be very strong. It takes time.
Is modern coaching to blame?
Muzumdar: Earlier there were spinners with different actions. In the 1980s there was Maninder Singh, Ravi Shastri, Venkatapathy Raju and so many others. But all had different actions which were natural. That is the essence of spin bowling - keep your action natural. I think now we are over-coaching some youngsters.
Take Harmeet Singh, the Mumbai left-arm spinner. When I saw him a few years ago in the indoor nets in Mumbai, he had a unique action. It was not the conventional action. His front foot would land with a heavy thrust on the ground. That was his skill and it helped him deliver the ball nicely. But now he delivers with a much lower arm and that is because he has changed his action. I fear we have lost one more good spinner due to over-coaching.
Maninder: As a coach, I do not try and change the action at all. I try to look at the strengths of the youngster and coach accordingly. But I have seen certified coaches teach kids about the arm coming from a certain height and degree. I would rather focus on the youngster's natural arc and polish that.
Hirwani: Many of my students at my academy in Indore tell me: "Sir, I have bowled 60 balls. Sir, I have bowled 50 balls today." I tell them: if you want to make cream, you have to condense it, and that only happens after boiling it for a period of time. A good rabri [sweet] is made only when the cream rises. For quality you need quantity.
I would bowl minimum of 90 overs a day as a youngster at the Cricket Club of Indore. I would bowl at just one stump for a couple of hours. In all, I would bowl for a minimum of five hours. If you are bowling at one stump you end up bowling about 30 overs in an hour. This kind of training, bowling at one stump, is equivalent to vocalists doing riyaaz [music practice]. You build your muscle memory.
Bedi: I keep hearing about pitching it in the right areas. The right areas is between your ears, in your mind.
I also had an outstanding coach. He gave me a lot of cricket sense. Cricket ability and cricket sense are two different things.
You just have to bowl. Bowl and bowl and bowl. I would feel good only when I had bowled sufficient hours to get the confidence first in the nets which then I could take in to the match. It took me a long, long time to learn good bowling. I would bowl at least seven to eight hours every day. I was obsessed.
The importance of captains
Muzumdar: As a captain you have to be patient. You need to relax even if a four or six is hit off a spinner. Nowadays batsmen go after a slow bowler, especially ones who do not impart too much spin on the ball, as soon as he comes in to bowl. So the captain immediately says to keep it tight till his fast bowlers can come back.
I saw the rise of Sairaj Bahutule under Sanjay Manjrekar, Ravi Shastri and Sachin Tendulkar. After about four years, I think, Sairaj picked his first five-for. You had to be patient. And I saw the development in Sairaj in that period. Against Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match, Ajay Sharma was taking control but Manjrekar persisted with Sairaj and Nilesh Kulkarni though Sharma was playing aggressively against the spinners. In the end Mumbai won that match.
Kartik: A captain can make or break a spinner. So he should understand what the spinner goes through, how they function and how they can be turned to match-winners. When the captain wants you to give as few runs as possible, he is not giving the spinner any confidence.
Maninder: Take the example of Gautam Gambhir. I have seen him in T20 cricket place a silly point and a short leg as soon as a wicket falls, when a spinner is bowling. Dhoni does not do that when a new batsman comes in in a Test match. When I had those close-in fielders my focus and concentration went a notch higher. But for that you have to have the habit of bowling with those fielders. With time your confidence goes high and also you stop worrying if you bowl a long hop or a full toss.
New talent on the horizon
Kartik: There are a few slow bowlers but not a spinner. When I started playing first-class cricket there were good spinners who were not getting a place in their state squads. Sunil Joshi, Kanwaljeet Singh, Sunil Subramaniam, Narendra Hirwani, Rajesh Chauhan, Bharati Vij, Sunil Lahore, Pradeep Jain, Rahul Sanghvi, Sarandeep Singh, Harbhajan Singh were quality spinners. Now I can't take a single name.
Hirwani: I have faith in two: Bengal offspinner Aamir Gani, who just turned 18. He has the skills and the desire. I also like Kuldeep Yadav, the chinaman bowler from Uttar Pradesh. He is an attacking bowler.
Maninder: Kuldeep Yadav, if the slight technical flaw in his front arm is fixed.
The problem with T20
Kartik: T20 cricket is not only harmful for a young spinner, it can also affect a senior bowler. Take Pragyan Ojha. He went at the rate of five an over, did not get a wicket in his 35 overs in the one Test he played on the India A tour of Australia in July. This is a spinner who has taken more than 100 Test wickets. He is confused after he has come back. So you can imagine the state of a young bowler who does not know his game inside out. All he is doing is bowling four overs for 25-30 runs and getting one wicket off a good or bad ball, because you know the next day you are up and running for the next T20 match.
Bedi: The modern generation is all about the IPL. Tell me if you get Rs 9, 10, 12 crore why would you want to bowl 35 overs [in a first-class match] for five lakhs? Sport is about money in the modern context.
The way out
Maninder: It is the BCCI's responsibility. When the IPL started, it had a lot of enemies. But that was also the time the BCCI should have taken the challenge of creating a pool of young talent and putting them under the expert guidance of former players or greats. These guys would not just talk about the specifics of spin bowling but also talk to them about how to sustain in the longer format of the game. If you speak to Bishan Bedi, the way he communicates, you would think: five-day cricket is what I want to play.
Kartik: If you are trying to push 11-year-olds into T20 cricket you are never going to learn the art of spin. Till the age of 21 at the state and age-group level at least, there should be no exposure to T20 cricket. Kids should play only three- or four-day cricket - learn to flight to ball, learn to get hit. By getting hit your natural survival instinct kicks in. Right now the natural instinct in T20 is to bowl quick. When you do that you cannot go back and bowl in four-day cricket, where you are trying to prise out a wicket.
If a spinner starts at the age of 12 or 13 he needs at least seven to eight years to understand his bowling: to bowl up and over, to flight the ball, to give the revs, and such things. You can coach, but if you are not allowing the player to first learn and understand his own game there is no point. Technically Test cricket is the deep end because getting a wicket when the batsman is defending is difficult.

RSS chief lauds Modi govt  row over live  national  telecastStorm over DD telecast of RSS chief's speech

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday gave a thumbs up to the Narendra Modi government in his annual Vijaya Dashami address controversially telecast live on Doordarshan.
Bhagwat lauded Modi for his initiatives on national security, economy and international relations and said that his government 'is moving in the right direction.'
He said people should give some more time to the Modi government for expedition and efficient execution of its policies.

DD telecast abuse of state power: Cong, Left
For the first time ever, the RSS chief's speech was telecast live on Doordarshan prompting the Congress and Left parties to accuse the Modi government of misusing the state broadcaster.
Terming the live telecast a "dangerous tradition" Congress spokesman Sandeep Dikshit said, "This is not an organisation which is completely neutral. It is a controversial organisation."
The CPI(M) condemned the telecast saying, "The national public broadcaster has no business to telecast live the speech of the chief of an organisation like the RSS."
Doordarshan officials defended the live coverage saying it was a newsworthy event.

Watch: Modi's US visit gives us renewed hope, says RSS chief Bhagwat
In his hour-long speech, Bhagwat, who had once pulled up the rank and file of the Sangh Parivar for shouting "Namo, Namo" and contested Narendra Modi giving credit to BJP chief Amit Shah for the election victory, showered praises on the government.
He said positive signs are emanating that give people the hope that India is emerging stronger on the international stage.
"There is no magic wand to change to change things, but the government seems committed," said the RSS chief who normally criticises the central government every year.
Bhagwat said Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to the US has sent positive signals and ushered in a new enthusiasm among people of the country.
"A new ray of hope has entered the hearts of the people. The entire country was feeling proud of the visit and the subsequent talks with the US government," he said, adding, the world needs India.
Voicing concern over 'upsurge in jihadi activities' in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the RSS chief said the state governments there were doing nothing to tackle the threat this posed to citizens.
He also criticised the governments in West Bengal and Assam saying, "The population imbalance in West Bengal and Assam has been caused by illegal migration of a particular community from across the national border. The ruling parties in those states have adopted a 'near surrender policy." 
The RSS chief also called for a ban on beef exports, and for an end to widespread purchases of Chinese products.
Speaking on global terrorism, he blamed western countries for the rise of Islamic State. "The selfish interest by the western countries is fully responsible for a new incarnation of terror and fundamentalism that emerged in West Asia in the name of ISIS," Bhagwat said.
RSS chief raised relevant issues: Modi
Meanwhile, PM Modi hailed Bhagwat's speech and said the issues of social reform he raised "are very relevant."
 
"Mohan Bhagwat ji talked about important national issues in his speech. The issues of social reform that he raised are very relevant today," Modi tweeted.

How Your Job Search Could Threaten Your Identityreddit
You finally landed a great job. Whether you were a new graduate, or among the long-term unemployed or under-employed, you put yourself out there and made it happen. But let's say that you flipped a few stones on the job market that were best left unturned, and you got scammed somewhere along the way.
It's not an uncommon tale. Think of it this way: A scammer's job is more difficult these days with so many consumers on the lookout for unauthorized charges on their credit cards or an account they don't recognize on their credit report. It's much easier for a fraudster to tap into a time in everyone's life when they're much more willing to hand over buckets of information about themselves to perfect strangers without a second thought -- and a job hunt is that perfect identity theft storm.
Identity-related crime is a dead certainty these days, but if you properly manage the threat it doesn't have to kill you. And while the pitfalls are everywhere (and the path to a new job is no exception), there are a few rules of the road that might make for a safer journey .
Know Who You're Dealing With
We're accustomed to filling out a gaggle of forms in the job application process -- giving a potential employer your full name, date of birth, education background, address, phone number, email and your Social Security number. And even the most reputable employers will ask for this information -- so can you tell if you're identity is in safe hands? The first line of defense is making sure you know whom you're giving that data to.
Whether you are responding to a job posting or scouring job boards, use common sense. Is it likely that Coca-Cola will be advertising a national position on a local job board?
If you think you're safe on a major message board listing jobs for your specific industry, think again. Many message boards and job listing services don't check out the paid job listings they publish, so you really have no idea who is on the other end of the email receiving your resume, which contains a significant amount of personally identifiable information.
Call the company HR department to make sure the job is the real deal. If you don't want to make that call, spend some quality time online researching the company.
Not every company will have a review on a site like Glassdoor.com, but no reputable company will be without a digital presence of some kind. Make sure you check to confirm the company you're dealing with has one.
Avoid Easy Money
There is no such thing as easy money, but there's no dearth of "companies" out there offering it to unwitting job seekers. The basic rule: If a job seems too good to be true, it probably is. Do your research. You might want to cut and paste a few lines from the job listing and search for them online. A scam will pop up immediately. Some common job scams are listed online with examples of the offers .
Know the Anatomy of a Scam
No reputable company is going to rush you through the hiring process. If you find yourself being invited to an online interview, and somehow during the course of a 10-minute back-and-forth you're offered a job and asked to provide personal information to get everything set for your first day -- run. While scams never follow the rules, as long as you do, the odds of everything being as it should be are ever more in your favor. Always use this rule: Trust but verify.
The next stop-gap is truly common sense. If a company asks you for money to help you find a job, if they ask for your Social Security number before making an offer of employment (this includes companies that run a credit check before making a final offer) or you just get a funny feeling that something's not quite right: Assume the worst, but hope for the best and do your due diligence.
Keep an Eye on Your Identity
If you haven't been terribly diligent about checking your credit throughout your job search, it's actually a great time to get into the habit. At the very least, make time to pull your free annual credit reports from the three major credit reporting agencies to look for signs of fraud, like loans or credit cards you didn't apply for. Monitoring your credit score regularly ( Credit.com shows you two free credit scores , updated monthly) can also tip you off to a big problem if you see a large, unexpected change in your scores. Being unemployed can take a huge toll on your finances; all the more reason to stop the bad guys before they make your life an even bigger hell.

Forex reserves fall by another $1.4 billionForex reserves continue to move down; fall by another $1.4 billion

(During the reporting week,…)
MUMBAI: Falling for the fourth week in a row, India's foreign exchange reserves went down by $1.415 billion to $314.181 billion in the week to September 26 on account of a hefty drop in non-US currency assets.
In the previous week, the reserves had fallen by $101.3 million to $315.596 billion. During the week to July 25, the reserves had touched $320.56 billion, a shade away from the life-time high of $320.79 billion recorded on September 2, 2011.
During the reporting week, the foreign currency assets (FCAs), a major constituent of overall reserves, dropped by $1.391 billion to $287.392 billion, RBI data showed.
FCAs, expressed in dollar terms, include the effect of appreciation/depreciation of the non-US currencies such as the euro , pound and yen held in reserves.
Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has described the fall in reserves as dip in valuation with appreciation of dollar against other currencies.
"In the recent weeks the dollar has been appreciating against the other currencies. Therefore, when we look at our reserves in dollar terms, they have been coming down," Rajan had said on the policy day on Tuesday.
He added that the fall in the forex kitty was not due to the central bank selling the greenback.
The gold reserves remained unchanged in the week under review at $20.933 billion.
The special drawing rights were down $17.4 million to $4.307 billion, while the country's reserve position with the IMF dipped by $6.2 million to $1.548 billion during the week, the data showed.

Deal Street in top gear  jumps 16.5% in Jan-...M&A
(The average M&A deal size…)
MUMBAI: Mergers and acquisitions involving domestic companies jumped to the highest level since 2011 to $26.1 billion during the first nine months this year.
The amount is up 16.5 per cent from the year-ago period. During the first three quarters of 2011, the domestic M&A market had stood at $34.5 billion, according to the data collated by Thomson Reuters.
The average M&A deal size climbed to $75.2 million in the January-September period, against $63.1 million a year ago as most deals were in the $500 million-plus range.
Out of this, domestic deals accounted for $11.1 billion, up 206.6 per cent over 2103, due to Sun Pharmaceutical's pending acquisition of Ranbaxy for $4.1 billion. The deal pushed the healthcare sector to capture 40.3 per cent of domestic deal activity.
However, total cross-board M&As plunged 40.2 per cent to $10.7 billion from the last year levels as both inbound and outbound activity declined. While inbound deals fell 24.6 per cent, outbound deals plummeted 70.2 per cent over the same period last year.
Total worth of completed deals amounted to $21.6 billion, up by 3.6 per cent to $22.4 billion in 2013.
Healthcare deals topped the deal street in market share with 23.2 per cent at $6.1 billion, an increase of 145.8 per cent increase from the first nine of 2013, making it the highest since 2008 when it stood at $6.2 billion.
Energy and power sector followed next with 14.4 per cent of the deals at $3.7 billion, but down to 39.8 per cent from the same period last year.
Technology, media, and telecom sector together managed a market share of 16.7 per cent at $4.3 billion from the first nine months of 2013, up by 35 per cent.

Switchback: Talking Tech (Oct. 3)A .

Apparently not. All the analysts I've talked to about this seem to agree that people really would rather have big screens for video rather than something that they don't have to carry an extra bag around for.
Plus -- not to get all conspiracy-sounding or anything -- the real demand for big-screen phones comes from overseas. (Asian customers like the big screens because it's easier for them to write; Europeans like them because many of them skipped the whole "tablet" thing.) U.S. customers are just along for the ride, since we're not the biggest smartphone growth market anymore.  So get used to it, is what I suppose I'm saying.
Though if the increase in device screen sizes actually causes retailers to make usable pockets, I'm all for it. The shirt I'm wearing now has two pockets that probably couldn't even fit a pack of gum.

Madhya Pradesh villagers offer prayers to Ravana on DussehraMadhya Pradesh villagers offer prayers to Ravana on Dussehra
Neeraj Santoshi , Hindustan Times  Ravan (Vidisha), October 03, 2014

As people across India gear up to witness the annual ritual of burning Ravana's effigy, some villagers in Madhya Pradesh have congregated to offer special prayers to Ravana at his temple. This is one of the few Ravan temples in India.
Chanting 'Jai Lankesh Jai Lankesh' and 'Ravan Baba Ki Jai', villagers have been turning up in great numbers since Friday morning to participate in the special prayers and have food at the 'bhandara' organised outside the temple premises.

The villagers have never burnt the effigy of Ravana here. For them, Ravana is their protective deity, without whose blessings no occasion — marriage or buying a new two-wheeler – is complete. No marriage is solemnised without sending a wedding card to Ravana at his temple. Not just that, all the two-wheeler owners in this village flaunt 'Jai Lankesh' symbols on their vehicles. They believe it prevents accidents.  
Ravan village is located in Nateran tehsil of Vidisha district, nearly 45kms from district headquarters, where for centuries, Ravan has been worshipped by Kanyakubja Brahmins, a Brahmin sub-sect, to which Ravan belonged.
HT travelled to Vidisha district to talk to these Kanyakubja Brahmins about their legacy and heritage and see how these Ravana worshippers celebrate Dussehra. On Friday, villagers gathered in front of the temple to offer special prayers. Some of them were having food outside the temple.
Inside the temple, a 10-feet idol of Ravana greets visitors. The priest Naresh Tiwari, says, "People are surprised to see us worshipping Ravana Baba but can there be a Ram without Ravana? He complements Ram. Ravana was a great Brahmin and an ardent devotee of Shiva. We, who have been receiving his blessings, are proof that our Baba is not evil. He just played his part to let the world see the greatness of Ram but we see his greatness."

In Ravan and its surrounding villages, thousands of Kanyakubja Brahmins as well as people from other castes consider Ravaanaas their protective deity and have never burnt his effigy. A few years ago, residents of the area collected money to build a small temple around the ancient idol.
"Ravan Baba is a constant in all our affairs. The local legend is that an unforeseen calamity would strike the village if anyone tries to put the idol in upright position or disturb it in some way," said Ram Lakhan Tiwari, an elderly man in the village.
Another villager, Hemraj Tiwari, a bank employee, said wherever they go, live or work, they have to worship Ravana, who otherwise gets furious like Lord Shiva. "We believe Ravan Baba's statue wards off evil influence and misfortune from our lives. We have to show our respect to him as has been done by our forefathers for centuries," said Kamal Singh Dhakad, a farmer.  
Amidst the Dussehra celebrations, their faith in Ravana continues to remain unshaken. Bunty Singh, a mason in the village, said when the world burns Ravan Baba’s effigy, they celebrate his ethos. "Our Ravana Baba was a great warrior and scholar. The problem is that people are burning the wrong Ravana. The real evils are roaming freely," he says.

Cameron's address promised tax cuts for 30 mn workers if Conservatives win May 2015 election & his speech was seen as a pitch to return to office.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives today took the lead in a YouGov opinion poll for the first time since March 2012, following his party conference speech.
Cameron's address on Wednesday promised tax cuts for 30 million workers if the Conservatives win the May 2015 general election and his speech was largely seen as a pitch to be returned to office.
The poll put the centre-right Conservatives on 35 percent, with the opposition centre-left Labour Party, led by Ed Miliband , on 34 percent.
The populist United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) was on 14 percent and the centrist Liberal Democrats , the junior partner in the coalition government, on six percent.
If replicated at the general election, with an even swing, such figures would, due to the formulation of Britain's constituencies, likely still leave Labour comfortably the biggest party in parliament but slightly short of a majority.
The survey found people expect their finances to suffer less under a Conservative government, but believe they will be poorer in five years' time irrespective of who wins.
YouGov president Peter Kellner said the big polling issues ahead of the election remained unresolved.
"Can the Tories turn their big lead over Labour on the economy into extra votes as the election approaches? Can Miliband persuade floating voters that he is up to the job of prime minister?" he asked.
He also said it was unclear whether UKIP could hang on to the mainly Conservative voters it had won in the past two years, if the Liberals could revive their "terrible fortunes" and whether the Scottish nationalists could overrun Labour strongholds in Scotland.
YouGov surveyed 2,133 British adults on Wednesday and Thursday.

PATNA: At least 32 people, including 20 women and 10 children, were killed and 26 others injured in a stampede that broke out this evening at the sprawling Gandhi Maidan filled with huge crowds here shortly after the end of the Dussehra celebrations.
The tragedy struck at around 7 PM at the South East corner of the ground near the Exhibition road when people were returning after watching the "Ravana Vadh" (killing of demon king) event and jostled with each other to move ahead, eyewitnesses and officials said.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered to watch the annual event at the historic Gandhi Maidan where several pockets were reportedly dimly lit when the stampede broke out.
Patna Medical College and Hospital'a (PMCH) Deputy Superintendent Sudhanshu Singh said 32 people died in the stampede--20 women, 10 children and two men. Seven girls were among the 10 child victims, he said, adding 26 people were injured and receiving treatment.
Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has ordered an inquiry by Home Secretary and Additional Director General of Police (Headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey, the CMO said.
He has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 3 lakh each to the dead.
Condoling the loss of lives in the stampede, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sanctioned an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the next of kin of those killed.
Eyewitnesses said the stampede was sparked by rumours that a live high high tension wire had snapped and fallen on ground triggering panic. However, there was no official confirmation of the exact cause of the stampede.
Slippers, shoes and footwear lay strewn on a one-km stretch at the stampede site as people tried to flee from the scene.
The PMCH has been cordoned off by the security forces. Hundreds of people were milling around the PMCH, some of them wailing, trying to locate their near and dear ones who got separated in the event.
Several ambulances were seen going inside the PMCH carrying stampede victims.
"There was a rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over in the frenzy," Patna District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma said.
The Bihar Chief Minister was present at the Gandhi Maidan where people watched an arrow setting the 60 feet tall effigy of Ravan into flames.
Inspector General of Police(Patna zone) Kundan Krishnan was seen manning the entrance of the PMCH regulating the entry of people.

Facebook plots first steps into health care field with support communities, apps
Could Facebook help people with their health care?
Facebook's organ-donor status could lead to more health care integration.
Facebook already knows who your friends are and the kind of things that grab your attention. Soon, it could also know the state of your health.
On the heels of fellow Silicon Valley technology companies Apple and Google, Facebook is plotting its first steps into the fertile field of health care, said three people familiar with the matter. The people requested anonymity as the plans are still in development.
The company is exploring creating online "support communities" that would connect Facebook users suffering from various ailments. A small team is also considering new preventive care applications that would help people improve their lifestyles.
In recent months, the sources said, the social networking giant has been holding meetings with medical industry experts and entrepreneurs, and is setting up a research and development unit to test new health apps. Facebook is still in the idea-gathering stage, the people said.
Health care has historically been an area of interest for Facebook, but it has taken a back seat to more pressing products.
Nope. Not Facebook. Between privacy & security concerns and their anti-pharma bias, I would never share too much info there. I'm all for support and awareness, but Facebook doesn't measure up to my expectations of TRUST...
ClueBringer219

Recently, Facebook executives have come to realize that health care might work as a tool to increase engagement with the site.
One catalyst: the unexpected success of Facebook's "organ-donor status initiative," introduced in 2012. The day that Facebook altered profile pages to allow members to specify their organ-donor status, 13,054 people registered to be organ donors online in the United States, a 21-fold increase over the daily average of 616 registrations, according to a June 2013 study published in the American Journal of Transplantation.
Separately, Facebook product teams noticed that people with chronic ailments such as diabetes would search the social networking site for advice, said one former Facebook insider. In addition, the proliferation of patient networks such as PatientsLikeMe demonstrate that people are increasingly comfortable sharing symptoms and treatment experiences online.
Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg may step up his personal involvement in health. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, a pediatric resident at University of California at San Francisco, recently donated $5 million to the Ravenswood Health Center in East Palo Alto, Calif.
Any advertising built around the health initiatives would not be as targeted as it could be on television or other media. Pharmaceutical companies, for instance, are prohibited from using Facebook to promote the sale of prescription drugs, in part because of concerns surrounding disclosures.
Privacy concerns
Privacy, an area where the company has faced considerable criticism over the years, will likely prove a challenge. The company recently apologized to users for manipulating news feeds for the purposes of research.
But Facebook may already have a few ideas to alleviate privacy concerns around its health initiatives. The company is considering rolling out its first health application quietly and under a different name, a source said. Market research commissioned by Facebook found that many of its users were unaware that photo service Instagram is owned by Facebook, the source said.
Facebook's recent softening of its policy requiring users to go by their real names may also bolster the company's health plans. People with chronic conditions may prefer to use an alias when sharing their health experiences.
"I could see Facebook doing well with applications for lifestyle and wellness, but really sick patients with conditions like cancer aren't fooling around," said Frank Williams, chief executive of Evolent Health, a company that provides software and services to doctors and health systems.
People would need anonymity and an assurance that their data and comments wouldn't be shared with their online contacts, advertisers, or pharmaceutical companies, Williams said.
It remains unclear whether Facebook will moderate or curate the content shared in the support communities, or bring in outside medical experts to provide context.
Facebook declined to comment on its health care plans.

Sonia Gandhi expresses shock at Patna stampede deathPrint
Press Trust of India | Posted: October 3, 2014 10:11 pm | Updated: October 3, 2014 10:13 pm
Congress President Sonia Gandhi tonight expressed “shock and grief” over the deaths and injuries in a stampede in Patna.
“Dismayed at the unfortunate incident, Gandhi expressed the hope that the injured are being adequately attended to and conveyed her condolences to the families of those who passed away,” a Congress statement said here.
Thirty two people, most of them women and children, were killed and several injured in a stampede that broke out this evening at the Gandhi Maidan in the Bihar capital shortly after the Dussehra celebrations there.
The tragedy occurred when people were returning after watching the “Ravan Vadh” ceremony where a huge crowd had gathered to witness the event, police said.
Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also expressed sadness at the incident and attacked the JD(U) government in Bihar for allegedly failing to put in place measures to prevent the tragedy.
He said similar incidents had taken place during Chhatt puja in Bihar but the state government has “failed to learn lessons.”
Paswan, MP from Bihar, will be visiting the state tomorrow to take stock of the situation.
JD (U) chief Sharad Yadav assured the state government headed by his party will probe the incident and take action against those responsible for failing to take adequate precautionary measures.
Expressing sorrow at the tragedy, Yadav said “the incident will be probed and those whose laxity and carelessness led to the tragedy will face strong action.”

Drones to patrol Delhi this festive seasonDrones to patrol Delhi this festive season

Visitors to the Ramlila or Durga Puja Pandal this year were not only under the watchful eyes of the Delhi Police on the ground, but in the air too. The Delhi Police have successfully conducted its trial run of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones to boost their surveillance capabilities in crowded areas.
Before this latest attempt, these eyes in the skies were used by the traffic police at Rafi Marg to monitor traffic.
“It is a very useful tool to monitor both traffic as well as law and order. It can also be used to catch a thief in narrow lanes. The drones come with a technology where we can tag a bike and it can tell us the location of the vehicle,” said Muktesh Chander, special CP (traffic), who also heads the technical committee to purchase new equipment for Delhi Police.  
Officials said the drones used for the trial run were of high quality and capable of working well up to 2-3 km radius.
“It produced good quality images and can be remote-controlled. If contact is lost, it comes with a technology where it will return to the designated path,” said a senior Delhi Police official, requesting anonymity.
Sources said that one drone will cost ` 20-30 lakh and the Delhi Police will float tenders soon.
Currently, the Delhi Police are in the process of finalising the specifications for the drones and will most likely prefer ones of 2m length and 1m wide.
Though senior officials are ready to induct this in the Delhi police’s repertoire, they are currently in talks with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to check if they have any objection.
“Before induction, we will take the Directorate General of Civil Aviation into confidence. The feedback of the trial run will be submitted. We need to keep pace with the latest technologies and this is an ideal tool. If required, we will conduct another trial run in markets during Diwali,” the official added.

In Baramati, the home turf of the Pawars, it rarely happens that a member of the first family faces vociferous protests during a public rally. But on Thursday, Sunetra Pawar, wife of former deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar, had to leave her rally in Baramati mid-way after the crowd hurled a volley of questions on development and infrastructure at her. A day later, she talks to Manoj More about what exactly happened, and why her husband won’t campaign in Baramati, the Assembly constituency from where he is contesting.
There were reports that somebody hurled stones at you at Thursday’s rally in Dheklewadi
No, that’s not true. There were protests by four-five youths when I went to address a rally. As I was addressing the crowd, they raised their voice. I found it difficult to speak amid the din. We then left the place.
What was the immediate provocation?
I heard that some Dhangar Kruti Samiti members were protesting. Maybe they wanted to score political points… this is a democracy and everyone has a right to protest. But except for protest by a handful of youths, nothing happened.
Weren’t there protests about lack of amenities in their area?
In Baramati, we have done so much work that there is hardly any room for complaints. Baramati does not lack public amenities. There is politics behind the protest and I have taken it in my stride.
Since you are Ajit’s campaign manager, what is your style of campaigning?
My major thrust is on door-to-door campaigning. We do hold corner meetings, but I feel a personal touch with voters is very important. We campaign mostly during morning and then for a few hours in the evening.
What do you promise voters?
We don’t have to promise voters anything. We never ask for votes. We just have to meet them. I greet them with folded hands and that’s about it. This is because we have provided all kinds of public amenities in Baramati. There is no public project that the Pawar family has not implemented.
How many rallies will Ajit address in Baramati?
There is no need for my husband to campaign in Baramati. I, scores of our relatives and party supporters are taking care of his campaign.
So he will not visit Baramati at all?
He inaugurated the election campaign and now he will address the concluding election rally. This is our tradition in Baramati. My husband won’t campaign here. Instead, he will tour the entire state and campaign for other NCP candidates.
How do you think your husband will fare?
All voters in Baramati are our relatives…We don’t have to worry about the outcome.
What do you feel about the allegations levelled against your husband?
Any human being would get hurt when baseless allegations are being discussed. But I know this is all politics. If you are in politics, you should be prepared to face such situations. It doesn’t worry my husband as well.
Does he get time to himself?
No, not at all. He wakes up at 5.30 am and gets on with this work. He does not go continued…

Chargesheet filed in Darbha attackPrint
Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:30 am
The NIA has filed its chargesheet in the Darbha attack case in which 27 persons, including senior most Congress leaders of Chhattisgarh, were killed in a Maoist ambush in Bastar district last May.
It was the biggest ever Maoist attack on a political convoy in the country in which then PCC chief Nand Kumar Patel, former state Leader of Opposition Mahendra Karma and former Central Minister V C Shukla were killed.
The NIA has named as many as 157 accused in the case, of which nine have been arrested so far. The chargesheet was presented before a special NIA court of Justice Mahadev Katulkar in Bilaspur last week. Subsequently, the court sent all the arrested accused to judicial custody.
Of the named accused, 10 have already surrendered and hence were not arrested.The next hearing is on November 20 when charges will be framed.

Delhi Confidential: In DemandExpress News Service | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:25 am
Elections in Haryana are yet to take place but political parties of various hues are already reaching out to one another for possible post-poll alliances in the event of a hung House. Kuldeep Bishnoi’s Haryana Janhit Congress, whose alliance with the BJP snapped few months ago, seems to be the most preferred choice of major parties. However, Bishnoi is keeping his cards close to his chest and has decided to wait for the results before deciding which way to go.
OLD LINKS
When the NDA government came to power at the Centre, many expected RSS workers, especially the self-styled ones, to try and use excuses to stake claim to various offices. However, the reasons being extended by many lawyers and retired high court judges to seek various appointments have become a topic of discussion in the corridors of power. A former HC judge, for example, told senior BJP leaders about his old Sangh links to seek the appointment of his lawyer-son as a law officer. There are also instances of lawyers’ résumés landing up in Shastri Bhawan for appointment as standing counsel due to their RSS links also abound. The government, however, is not ready to move in a hurry.
EXPANSION MODE
With all the extra work the Prime Minister’s Office has appropriated to itself, it is finding the need to expand. It is said to be looking for extra space in the South Block. The casualty is likely to be the Ministry of External Affairs, which is also housed in the same building. It is learnt that the PMO has asked the MEA to vacate at least four rooms. MEA, incidentally, has got a brand new building for itself, the Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan on Janpath, but many officers prefer to work from their old offices in South Block. The PMO’s request might force some more MEA officials to finally shift to their new offices.
MORE CHANGES
Another round of governors’ appointments is said to be around the corner now that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is back from the US. The states where a change is expected are Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and J&K. Madhya Pradesh Governor Ram Naresh Yadav has been in office since 2011, while N N Vohra has been J&K Governor since 2008. K Rosaiah of Tamil Nadu is a former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.

The stock market stabilizes. (Sal Ruibal, USA TODAY)
Just when it looked like the U.S. stock market was going to crack amid the pressure of a new array of risks, it found its footing and stabilized thanks to a handful of factors that acted like shock absorbers for the market.
Just three days ago, on the first day of October, a month that spooks investors because of stock market crashes in October 1929 and 1987, stocks were in free fall. Wall Street was buzzing about how far stocks could fall — and whether the benchmark S&P 500-stock index was finally on a collision course with its first 10% drop, or correction, since late 2011.
The world — and the stock market — appeared in chaos and disarray as a confluence of scary headlines rattled the nerves of even the most ardent Wall Street bulls, prompting a 238-point plunge Wednesday in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong seemed on the verge of spinning out of control. The U.S. announced its first-ever diagnosis of Ebola on home soil. The small-cap Russell 2000 stock index — a bull market leader the past five years — fell 10% below its early March all-time high and into official “correction” territory. And weak manufacturing readings in Germany and the rest of the eurozone sparked fears of a global growth slowdown.
Fast-forward to today and the stock market appears far more stable, with stocks turning sharply higher amid fresh signs that the U.S. labor market — and the broader economy — may be in solid shape after all.
In early trading Friday, the Dow was up more than 140 points to 16,941, after climbing as much as 150 points earlier in the session. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.9% to 1964 and the Nasdaq was up 1.2% to 4483.
What caused the tone of the market to flip from bearish to bullish virtually overnight? Here are five factors that have acted as shock absorbers for the fragile market at a pivotal time.
1. Blowout jobs report. Any concerns that the U.S. job-creation machine was stalling out went by the wayside Friday when the government released its September jobs report.
The U.S. economy created 248,000 jobs last month, topping forecasts of 215,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The unemployment rate declined to 5.9% — the lowest level since July 2008 — and better than the 6.1% forecast.
The government also revised up the weak August jobs report to 180,000 jobs from 142,000, and July job gains to 243,000 from 212,000. However, worker pay didn’t budge, as average hourly wage gains were unchanged. That signals that wage inflation remains tame, which is a bullish sign for stocks as it gives the Federal Reserve some ammunition to argue that speeding up the timetable for interest rate hikes might not be necessary, despite the strong reading on the labor market.
The upbeat jobs report also shows that the economy is not falling off a cliff and is still strong enough to support solid corporate earnings growth despite slowdowns in Europe and China.
“This morning there is a sigh of relief on both Wall Street and Main Street,” says Sung Won Sohn, a finance professor at California State University CI. “The jobs slowdown in August was an aberration and the economy is back on a healthier growth trajectory.”
2. Hong Kong protests don’t cause meltdown. The pro-democracy protests have not spiraled out of control, despite the ongoing standoff between the China-backed Hong Kong government and protesters. In fact, the size of the street protests appeared to be dwindling Friday after the Hong Kong government agreed to talks with the protesters. What’s more, the key Hang Seng stock index rose 0.6% to 23,064.56 Friday after steep selloffs earlier in the week and after markets were closed for two days for holidays tied to China’s independence 65 years ago.
Investors viewed both developments in Asia as a sign that the protests might not spiral out of control as feared and morph into an economic crisis.
3. Small-cap stocks rebound. Market pessimism peaked Wednesday when the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index closed down more than 10% from its March 4 record high of 1208.65, putting it into official correction territory. However, the small-cap index mounted a 1% rebound Thursday and is up another 1% today.
The rebound in what is considered a proxy for risk-taking on Wall Street suggests that the buy-the-dip mentality on Wall Street is not dead. It also downplayed fears that the small-cap selloff was going to drag down the broader market.
4. Ebola, a scare, but not a crisis. The first diagnosed case of the deadly Ebola virus in the U.S. has dragged down shares of airlines and other travel-related stocks, but Wall Street is still not treating the scare as a major economic crisis — at least not yet. Markets typically don’t sell off sharply unless there is a clear sign that a health-related epidemic has real, lasting negative economic impact.
5. Seasonally strong time of year. The stock market is heading into its strongest seasonal three-month and six-month periods of the year, so investors are giving the market the benefit of the doubt for now. The bulls on Wall Street still argue that the economy and labor market are strong, which should translate into solid performance for corporate profitability, a key underpinning of the stock market rally the past five years.

Marriott International will pay $600,000 to resolve a Federal Communications Commission investigation into whether a hotel's employees blocked customers from using their personal Wi-Fi networks and then charged them to use the hotel network.
The FCC says that employees at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville disabled Wi-Fi networks established by consumers at its conference facilities. They then charged guests from $250 to $1,000 per device for access to the hotel network.
"It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hotspots while also charging consumers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel's own Wi-Fi network," FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc said in a statement. "This practice puts consumers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether."
The investigation began after a March 2013 complaint from someone who attended a function at the resort. That person, according to the FCC, alleged that the hotel was "jamming mobile hotspots so that you can't use them in the convention space."
The FCC says its investigation found that employees used "features of a Wi-Fi monitoring system at the Gaylord Opryland to contain and/or de- authenticate guest-created Wi-Fi hotspot access points in the conference facilities."
Marriott says it believes the actions of employees at the Gaylord Opryland were lawful.
"Marriott has a strong interest in ensuring that when our guests use our Wi-Fi service, they will be protected from rogue wireless hotspots that can cause degraded service, insidious cyber-attacks and identity theft," the company's statement says.
"Like many other institutions and companies in a wide variety of industries, including hospitals and universities, the Gaylord Opryland protected its Wi-Fi network by using FCC-authorized equipment provided by well-known, reputable manufacturers," Marriott says. "We believe that the Opryland's actions were lawful.  We will continue to encourage the FCC to pursue a rulemaking in order to eliminate the ongoing confusion resulting from today's action and to assess the merits of its underlying policy."
In addition to paying the fine, Marriott will have to develop a plan to improve how it monitors and uses its Wi-Fi network at the Gaylord Opryland, the FCC says.
The company will have to file progress reports to the FCC every three months for three years.

CINCINNATI (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says pellet guns have been pulled from shelves at the Ohio store where a 22-year-old man holding an air rifle was fatally shot by police.
A spokesman for the world's largest retailer tells The Associated Press that the move last week was a store-specific decision, not a change in national policy.
A special grand jury in the racially charged case decided last week that officers' actions Aug. 5 were justified. Police responded to a 911 call that a man was waving what appeared to be a rifle, and officers have said John Crawford III, who was black, was shot after not responding to commands to drop his weapon.
It turned out to be an air rifle.
A family attorney calls Wal-Mart's action "about eight weeks too late."

The gendered brain debateUpdated: October 2, 2014 02:21 IST
The gendered brain debate
social issues (general)
All this latest slice of paranoid gender-obsessed biology teaches is how attached science is to its pink and blue safety blankets
I just took a test to see whether I had a male or female brain. This is how it goes: you clasp your hands in front of you, and check whether your left or right thumb is on top of the other. Right thumb on top? You’re basically a woman. Left thumb on top? Come over and join me in the man camp — we have Nintendo 64s.
Devastated as I am that my brain is apparently in complete opposition with the gender I’ve always aligned myself with, I will attempt to take the results with a massive pinch of salt. For one thing, I’ve always been massively suspicious of attempts to gender the brain, whatever the source. And I had read about the test in the Daily Mail, whose scientific credentials on psychological theory go about as far as my mate Paul shrugging in the pub and saying, “Women, eh?”
Brain gendering isn’t just tabloid fodder, by any means, and it’s not a trend that died with Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. The Guardian debunked various myths about male and female brains last December. Popular Science also pointed out last year that we should stop looking for “hardwired” differences in male and female brains because there’s no way for us to prove the direction of causation.
Whenever a press release gets written up into the mainstream media claiming to have found the key to supposed male and female differences because it’s all located in the brain, we go through the same rigmarole: everybody humours it for a bit; someone claims that it explains their ex-boyfriend’s thoughtless behaviour; someone else counters on a Reddit thread that he probably couldn’t help it if his neural connections weren’t dense enough to deal with the relationship; and eventually we all throw up our hands and admit what we’ve learned from all this to-ing and fro-ing related to a few MRI scans and a barely significant statistic: precisely nothing.
But that doesn’t stop us. It’s come around again, polluting everything from the Mail to the BBC, in the form of a programme called — what else? — Is Your Brain Male or Female? If you are old enough to read the headline, you might have already had some thoughts about whether your brain was male or female that are ultimately a lot more meaningful than anything you can learn from a picture of someone else’s synapses. You might even have come to the conclusion that you don’t fit easily into a gender binary that says men like spatial tasks, hunting antelope and fixing cars, and women like gossip, makeup and crying. You might not care to have a male or a female brain, but instead think of yourself as a person with various facets of traditional masculinity and femininity and a penchant for wearing blue eyeliner on a Saturday night because that’s just what Peckham’s all about. Imagine that.
There are biological differences present in most men and women that help medical experts come up with amazing things, such as pain medication or treatment for head injuries that take hormonal balances into account. However, the endless attempts to look at your brain — or, even more dangerously, your behaviour — and declare you a biological oddity have far-reaching negative consequences. What exactly are you supposed to do if you’re a feminine boy bullied by your macho father whose right thumb rests over his left when he clasps his hands? Resign yourself to the idea that you were born with a brain that somehow just isn’t right? And if you’re a female teenage tomboy flirting with androgyny, does it help if someone wants to medicalise your explorations into your own identity?
This paranoid, gender-obsessed landscape that uses evolutionary biology as a stick to beat us deserves to be taken seriously no longer. If we really want to progress radically, we’ll have to let go of the pink and blue safety blankets and start talking about the fact that everyone’s brain and behaviour are different — which is probably the scariest fact of all.

The 5 Tax Mistakes You re Making Right Nowreddit
I know, it's a busy time of year. You're back from the summer holidays. Orders need to get out the door. Projects need to be done. Budgets need to be approved. You're doing your best. But there's something big you're not doing. And you know it. It has to do with your taxes, which, if you're making profits, is likely the biggest expense on your income statement. You could be doing things right now to save on taxes. But you hate taxes and even talking about them kind of upsets your stomach. Me too. But you need to do pay attention. Now. Because if you're like most of my clients you're making at least five mistakes. Fixable mistakes, as long as you take action right away.
You're not making your estimated payments. Or you're making them, but just not on time. Or you're making them, but you're not paying in the full amount it. I get it--it never seems like you have enough cash. It physically repels to sign the check. It kills you that just when you see your business starting to thrive you get knocked back with a giant tax payment. But this is the law and many of my clients try to pretend it's not. If you make your payments late you'll be subject to penalties and fines. If you don't make your payments you'll be subject to penalties, fines and a whopping tax bill next year when you file your returns. And if you don't make your payment then well I have two words for you: Wesley Snipes. The smart business people I know suck it up, schedule their tax payments with their other accounts payables and forecast this amount as a required quarterly disbursement along with everything else. Tax payments are not optional. Don't make this mistake.
You are not putting enough away in your retirement plan. A recent survey found that 70 percent of business owners have their wealth tied up in their own businesses. Another report found that only 5 percent of companies with four or fewer employees offer a retirement plan, compared to 31 percent of companies with between 26 and 100 employees (which is still insanely low). The more retirement options you offer to your employees the more you can put away yourself. Not only that but many of my clients still don't fully take advantage of individual IRAs or even create Simple Employer Plans (SEPs) for themselves. Not only can this save taxes, but retirement plans are critical for diversifying your assets in case, God forbid, your own company falls on hard times. Put a plan in place. Now.
You cling to bad stuff. It's time to face it: that customer is never going to pay you. He says he will, you hope he will, it kills you that he hasn't. But he won't. And by the way, that pallet of calibrated switch-screws aren't going to sell either. I know you had good intentions when you bought it. But no one wants it. It was a bad buy. Move on. Write off the receivable. Write off the inventory. This will clear your head. It will clear some space on the floor. And it will provide a tax deduction for you too.
You're not taking advantage of the healthcare tax credit. OK, I admit this is not such an enormous benefit and most of my clients don't qualify. That's because to take advantage of this credit you can only employ less than 25 people and their average salary must be less than $50,000 per year. And you have to purchase health insurance. And (soon enough) from the government exchanges. But if you do qualify for this, you can get a credit of up to 50% on what you pay for your health insurance. And that's a credit, which means you can carry it forward or backward to offset taxes in the past or future if you're not making any money this year. If you do qualify and you haven't taken advantage of this since 2010 then you should have a frank discussion with your accountant. If he's still employed by you after this discussion then have him go back and amend your past returns to take advantage of this credit.
You're not meeting often enough with your accountant. I know, he's not the most exciting guy in the world. I'm an accountant and my idea of excitement on a Saturday night is watching Ken Burns' latest biography on Roosevelt. But this is a cost of doing business--meeting with your accountant (hopefully a Certified Public Accountant). And you need to do this at least quarterly. Yes, quarterly. Too many of my clients have a "year end" tax meeting (which means late December or, and I'm not kidding...January) which oftentimes just turns into a crying and moaning session about the state of America and our broken tax system. And it's usually the accountant who's doing the crying and moaning. By meeting with your CPA quarterly, sharing your numbers, discussing the future and (egads!) planning you will be able to consider the tax impacts of any significant business transaction you make before you make them in order to take the most advantage.
You're not doing these things, are you? Thought not. Hey, join the crowd.

How young people should save for retirementHow young people should save for retirement
By Carolyn Bigda
Young people should be saving for retirement. Here are some easy ways to start.
How much do you need to save for retirement?
It's the million-dollar question that never has a precise answer, especially for young people who have decades to go before retiring. But plenty of researchers and financial advisers try to provide some guidance, even for those just starting out.
Here are their suggestions:
Save 15 percent. A study this summer by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found that a 25-year-old who saved 15 percent of her salary annually could retire at age 62 and replace 70 percent of her preretirement income.
cComments
@Gabby Chen You realize that by being "as conservative as can be," you're actually putting your retirement savings at risk, right? Earning 2% a year is barely keeping up with inflation, and you might actually be LOSING money each year. Money that you don't need for 30...
markr867

If you put away only 10 percent every year, you can take home the same amount of retirement income — you just have to wait until age 65 until you can finish working. (The calculations assume an average annual return of 4 percent, after inflation.)
What happens if you don't start putting away for retirement until you're older? As you may have guessed, you have to save more to reach the same goals. A 35-year-old with zero retirement savings would have to save 24 percent of his income to retire at 62, and 15 percent of his salary to leave the workforce at age 65.
Include the employer match. Setting aside 10 percent to 15 percent of your income may seem like a lot of money, but the good news is those figures include any matching contributions your receive from an employer.
More than 80 percent of companies with a 401(k) or other retirement plan offer a match, according to the latest data from the Plan Sponsor Council of America, a nonprofit that works on behalf of companies offering 401(k) plans.
And the most common match formula is 50 percent of every dollar contributed, up to the first 6 percent of pay. That means if you earn $50,000 and contribute 6 percent to your 401(k), or $3,000, your employer will kick in another $1,500. Together, that adds up to a 9 percent contribution — not far off from the percentage you need to save each year.
Make adjustments. What if you stop saving for retirement for a few years, say, because you go back to graduate school or take time off to have children?
A study by Baltimore-based mutual fund company T. Rowe Price found that a worker who had been saving 13 percent of his salary until age 35, but then stops making any retirement contributions for five years, can catch up.
To do so, though, he would have to increase his annual savings rate to 17 percent. (Older workers who take a break have to increase their contributions by considerably more because there is less time for the money to compound and grow.)
The bottom line: When it comes to retirement saving, "there's no such thing as 'all set,'" said William Bernstein, a financial adviser and author of several books about investing, including "If You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly." "Only your probability of success changes, or you have to save more or less."
Use calculators. Plenty of calculators are available online to help you.
The Vanguard Group, known for its low-cost index mutual funds, offers a simple version at personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/retirement (click on "set your retirement goals"). The calculator estimates how much you'll have accumulated by age 65, as well as the amount of money you can withdraw each month.

Finding Out Whom to Trust When You Do Business Togetherreddit
I began thinking about the importance of knowing whom to trust in doing business together when I experienced two major breaches, one as a customer seeking services and another when I was providing services myself.  In both cases, I hadn't done any advance checking of these companies. In one case, I was drawn by the convenience of finding a service in my town; in the other, I was willing to extend credit based on a promise of future work and an offer to pay the balance at a meeting where I was invited to pitch my services. Plus I was impressed by the flair and confidence of the person hiring for me.
But in both cases, I made major mistakes by not doing some careful checking in advance.  Many people don't do this either, because they don't want to take the time to check and because they want to use the service or get a customer or client to opt for their service now.   But often it pays to check and not hire the service provider or extend credit until you do some checking.
The first situation, which I have written about in Huffington Post articles: Auto Repair Scams and in A Warning About Warnings , occurred when I went to a local auto repair service.  I went there to have my old Toyota station wagon checked to be sure it would be safe to go to Las Vegas, and after the inspection the manager assured me it would be fine, so I got the air conditioner fixed for the trip.  But he didn't warn me about the risks I might face in driving a 22-year old car with 144,000 miles on it to a very hot location during the summer, though I knew of a few other people who had driven cars over 200,000 miles.  But the auto repair expert had a duty to warn me, since he was the expert and I sought out his advice on this very subject.  Then, since I wasn't warned, after I fixed the air conditioning, the car overheated on my third day in Las Vegas, and fearing the risk of taking the car back across the desert after fixing the radiator, since other things could go wrong, I ended up getting a new car I couldn't afford, and later the auto repair service denied any responsibility for what happened, even the unnecessary air conditioner repair I wouldn't have gotten if warned of the risk; I would have flown and rented a car instead.  However, if I had checked out this company's reviews, such as on Yelp http://www.yelp.com, before deciding to take my car in for an inspection and then a repair, I would have looked for another service center, since the company had several negative reviews about poor service and unnecessary repairs -- and now they have my bad review, too.
The second situation occurred when I was in the position of providing a service to a prospective client.  Normally, with a new client, I would get a retainer check and wait for it to clear my bank or get a payment through PayPal or a credit card. But in this case, the client seemed so stylish and personable, talked about hiring me for extensive work, and invited me to present my writing services at a weekend event at a luxury hotel. So I agreed to take small advance check and spent two days rewriting a manuscript.  But after that the client had low attendance at the weekend event and claimed to be waiting for checks to come through from expected clients.  So in the end, not only did the initial check bounce, but the client only paid a small amount on account. Then the additional payments due stopped coming, along with the client's excuses about why no money was available to pay me due to high office expense and the funds needed to bring in new clients.  That's when I thought to do some checking about this client and discovered several scathing reviews on Yelp from people who had hired this person to provide some services under another business name.  But they didn't get the promised services or obtain a refund for the services they didn't get. Needless to say, had I done some checking in the first place, I would never have advanced credit or done as much work as I had without being paid up front.
So where do you check?  One of the most well-known review services is Yelp, which covers most of the service industry, and even if some smaller shops and services don't have any reviews, the companies will often be in the Yelp database.  Plus now there are other services, which include the businesses listed in Google Places which turn up in a Google search.  Another is Angie's list, which charges a small membership fee to consumers and lists business for free.   Another site is Yahoo Local which has over 50 million reviews.  A few others include Citysearch, Merchant Circle, Insider Pages, and FourSquare.  Then there's the local Better Business Bureau and Chamber of Commerce, or try putting the name of the company owner or company in Google search and see what turns up. If there has been any extensive negative commentary about the company or company owner, it is likely to show up there
In short, before you make any major commitment to purchase services or agree to extend a substantial amount of credit to anyone, check them out to see if there are any warning signs through negative reviews online.

What it costs to make the iPad Air
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
If the iPhone 6 Plus isn't big enough for Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) junkies craving new gear, they only have to hold on just a little bit longer.
Technology news site Re/code reported Friday that Apple will hold a new event Oct. 16 to highlight updates to the iPad line, as well as new iMacs and the latest OS X operating system.
Related: Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer benches the Clippers' iPads
The site said the event will be more low-key compared to the huge affair Apple held for the iPhone 6, Apple Watch and ApplePay last month.
The iPad was once a sales dynamo, but lately it's been struggling. In it's most recent quarterly filing, Apple said iPad revenue had slipped 8% from a year before and the number of units it sold fell similarly. The device still makes up about 16% of the company's total sales.
With an increasingly varied range of iPads and a new collaboration with IBM ( IBM , Tech30 ), the updates unveiled later this month might be enough to get the device jibing with the rest of the company's renewed mojo .

Man ki baat: Radio Modi gives lessons in faith  of a differentkindOnly when you are ready to walk on your own will people show you the way, says Narendra Modi in his maiden Radio message.
New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 1:13 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday exhorted people to realise their own potential to herald an era of progress, “as the nation belongs to all individuals and not just the government alone”.
Modi said he would ease procedures for doing business, as he took to the radio for the first time to address the nation, with the promise to make it a regular affair. It is after decades that a prime minister is addressing the nation through radio.
“I have been receiving many interesting suggestions from people…. The country belongs to everyone, not just the government alone. It belongs to all its citizens,” Modi said, hinting that the nation’s progress is not the responsibility of the government alone. “If you have ideas and actual incidents which are constructive, do share with me. Together, let’s serve India and take our nation to newer heights,” he said, a day after he launched a national cleanliness/sanitation drive with gaiety.
He also referred to Mahatma Gandhi, whose birth anniversary was celebrated on Thursday, and hardsold one of the Mahatma’s favourite products — khadi. The Prime Minister urged people to buy any khadi product so that the poor engaged in their production could benefit.
He cited some of the interesting suggestions by people, include starting skill development from the 5th Standard, initiating special programmes to motivate specially-abled children, using more dustbins, banning polythene and making easier the registration of small-scale industries.
“You know, our scientists have undertaken the Mars mission successfully at minimum expenses. There is nothing lacking in our capabilities.” he said. “We need to recognise our internal strengths,” he added, narrating a story by Swami Vivekananda about how a lion, raised by sheep, rediscovered its prowess after meeting another lion.
Referring to specially-abled children, Modi said they are the “responsibility of not only their families but also the entire society”.
The Prime Minister harped on the ‘swachh bharat’ campaign launched on Thursday by him, adding that he had invited participation of nine prominent people, each of whom should attract nine more, who will involve nine more and so on, to create a chain.
“Let us pledge to affirm to remove dirt. Yesterday, we began the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and I want you all to join this abhiyan,” he said.
‘Man ki baat’
Remember the tiger who forgot how to roar because it was reared by sheep? Recognise your inner strength
Only when you are ready to walk on your own will people show you the way
We will help you, but this country is yours, not that of the government
Tune in twice a month, write to me, I have more to say

Modi and Sonia land in battlefield HaryanatodayComments
The Haryana BJP has pinned its hopes on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will address a series of rallies across the state, beginning in Karnal, from Saturday.
The rally is being considered the BJP’s way to counter the INLD’s campaign, especially after the party brought in its convicted chief Om Prakash Chautala to address a political rally in Jind.
The PM is expected to address eight-ten rallies in the state, covering all 10 parliamentary constituencies. Senior leaders Sushma Swaraj, Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chouhan are also expected to address rallies.
BJP leader Virender Garg said, “In the next 10 days, the party campaign will be high voltage. Besides Modi, a number of other leaders are coming to address rallies. There is no damage to the party because of Chautala’s appearance in the poll battle…”
The Congress campaign will also pick up pace as party president Sonia Gandhi addresses rallies at Rohtak and Sirsa Saturday. CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda has already reached Rohtak to pep up cadres in his hometown.
Congress sources said the party had intentionally organised Sonia’s rally in Rohtak, where it can ensure success, unlike the lacklustre Rahul Gandhi rallies during the Lok Sabha polls. Rahul will also campaign in the coming week, as will other senior Congress leaders.
Campaigning ends on October 13 and the state goes to polls on October 15.

Had nothing to do with BJP-Sena split:PawarPawar in Pune, Friday. (Source: Express photo by Arul Horizon)
Express News Service | Pune | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:55 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 9:25 am
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has denied MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s claim that he engineered the split between BJP and Shiv Sena.
Speaking at a campaign rally on Thursday, the MNS chief had claimed that Pawar had conveyed to the BJP leaders that the NCP would break ties with the Congress if they broke their alliance with the Sena. On September 26, the NCP announced its decision to break the alliance, within an hour of the BJP making the decision to part ways with the Sena public.
Addressing the media in Pune on Friday, Pawar denied the charge. “I played no role whatsoever in the Sena-BJP break up. I must thank Raj Thackeray for portraying me as a leader who can influence the decisions of a rival national party. We announced our decision to break the alliance with the Congress the same day because there wasn’t much time left. With only 24 hours to go for the nomination filing deadline, we had to announce our decision so that we could file nominations for all Assembly constituencies,” said Pawar.
Pawar said he did not anticipate that the NCP would be forced to take the extreme step, as Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and several other senior Congress leaders had appeared “extremely positive” about continuation of the Congress-NCP alliance in Maharashtra.
“When I met Sonia Gandhi, she was extremely positive about the continuation of the alliance in the state. Several other senior leaders also shared her feelings. We also had several rounds of meetings with national leaders and state leaders. However, while these talks were on, we learnt that the Congress had announced a list of 110 candidates, which also contained names of constituencies which we had demanded. This showed their intentions, so we did not have any other option but to fight alone,” said Pawar, adding that the party had prepared to contest only 130-135 seats and, hence, had to do a lot of running around at the last moment to field candidates from all constituencies.
Pawar also said the Narendra Modi wave would not be a factor and ruled out a post-poll alliance with the BJP.

Although dynastic politics took a drubbing during the Lok Sabha polls, elections in western Maharashtra’s Maratha heartland of Satara continue to be a family business.
In a majority of the region’s eight Assembly segments, the contest for the upcoming state polls would be decided by a clash between rival political dynasties rather than between rival parties.
Given the voters’ loyalty to dynasties, all parties have been liberal in giving election tickets to members of established political families.
The Shiv Sena and the BJP, which have limited presence in the region, have also adopted this strategy.
Interestingly, it was Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji’s descendent Udayanraje Bhosle, who halted Narendra Modi’s march in this belt, leading NCP to a resounding victory during the general elections. The sugar belt, which was the capital of Shivaji’s kingdom, has always been NCP’s mainstay. The NCP wrested four out of eight seats in the region during the 2009 Assembly polls, while Independents (3) and Congress (1) got the rest.
In Patan Assembly seat, the polls have been an affair between the Patankar and the Desai families for several decades. This time is no different. While the NCP has fielded sitting legislator and former public works department minister Vikramsinh Patankar’s son Satyajit, former Congress minister the late Balasaheb Desai’s son and former legislator Shambhuraj Desai is contesting on a Shiv Sena ticket for the fourth time.
Voters have remained loyal to both families even as they switched parties — Vikramsinh Patankar left Congress to join the NCP in 1999, while Desai left the Congress for the Sena in 1997. In fact, locals refer to local Shiv Sena workers as ‘Shambhusena’. Those backing the Patankars maintain that what they say matters more to them than what the NCP seniors say.
The race for Karad (North) Assembly seat is no different. It is a fight between the NCP’s Balasaheb Patil and the Congress’s Dhairyasheel Kadam. Patil, a three-time legislator, is the son former Congress heavyweight the late Pandurang Patil. Kadam too hails from a political dynasty. In 1999, Patil had contested as an Independent after being denied a ticket by the NCP, and won.
Former CM Prithviraj Chavan (Congress), who is the son of former Union minister Dajisaheb Chavan and former Congress state chief Premilakaki Chavan, will face BJP’s Atul Bhosale, who comes from the famous Mohite-Bhosle family, and seven-time legislator and Congress rebel Vilaskaka Undalkar (NCP) in Karad South.
Undalkar’s father was a renowned freedom fighter. While Undalkar, 77, has spent 35 years as a legislator, his family was in public life since much earlier. While Bhosale too has switched sides from the Congress, his supporters are confident that voters who have remained loyal to the family would remain with him.
Another Shivaji descendent, Shivendraraje Bhosale, continued…

There is no need for Ajit to campaign in Baramati we never ask forvotes‘There is no need for Ajit to campaign in Baramati… we never ask for votes’
Written by Manoj Dattatrye More | Baramati |       October 4, 2014 8:29 am
Comments
In Baramati, the home turf of the Pawars, it rarely happens that a member of the first family faces vociferous protests during a public rally. But on Thursday, Sunetra Pawar, wife of former deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar, had to leave her rally in Baramati mid-way after the crowd hurled a volley of questions on development and infrastructure at her. A day later, she talks to Manoj More about what exactly happened, and why her husband won’t campaign in Baramati, the Assembly constituency from where he is contesting.
There were reports that somebody hurled stones at you at Thursday’s rally in Dheklewadi
No, that’s not true. There were protests by four-five youths when I went to address a rally. As I was addressing the crowd, they raised their voice. I found it difficult to speak amid the din. We then left the place.
What was the immediate provocation?
I heard that some Dhangar Kruti Samiti members were protesting. Maybe they wanted to score political points… this is a democracy and everyone has a right to protest. But except for protest by a handful of youths, nothing happened.
Weren’t there protests about lack of amenities in their area?
In Baramati, we have done so much work that there is hardly any room for complaints. Baramati does not lack public amenities. There is politics behind the protest and I have taken it in my stride.
Since you are Ajit’s campaign manager, what is your style of campaigning?
My major thrust is on door-to-door campaigning. We do hold corner meetings, but I feel a personal touch with voters is very important. We campaign mostly during morning and then for a few hours in the evening.
What do you promise voters?
We don’t have to promise voters anything. We never ask for votes. We just have to meet them. I greet them with folded hands and that’s about it. This is because we have provided all kinds of public amenities in Baramati. There is no public project that the Pawar family has not implemented.
How many rallies will Ajit address in Baramati?
There is no need for my husband to campaign in Baramati. I, scores of our relatives and party supporters are taking care of his campaign.
So he will not visit Baramati at all?
He inaugurated the election campaign and now he will address the concluding election rally. This is our tradition in Baramati. My husband won’t campaign here. Instead, he will tour the entire state and campaign for other NCP candidates.
How do you think your husband will fare?
All voters in Baramati are our relatives…We don’t have to worry about the outcome.
What do you feel about the allegations levelled against your husband?
Any human being would get hurt when baseless allegations are being discussed. But I know this is all politics. If you are in politics, you should be prepared to face such situations. It doesn’t worry my husband as well.
Does he get time to himself?
No, not at all. He wakes up at 5.30 am and gets on with this work. He does not go continued…

Chargesheet filed in DarbhaattackPrint
Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:30 am
The NIA has filed its chargesheet in the Darbha attack case in which 27 persons, including senior most Congress leaders of Chhattisgarh, were killed in a Maoist ambush in Bastar district last May.
It was the biggest ever Maoist attack on a political convoy in the country in which then PCC chief Nand Kumar Patel, former state Leader of Opposition Mahendra Karma and former Central Minister V C Shukla were killed.
The NIA has named as many as 157 accused in the case, of which nine have been arrested so far. The chargesheet was presented before a special NIA court of Justice Mahadev Katulkar in Bilaspur last week. Subsequently, the court sent all the arrested accused to judicial custody.
Of the named accused, 10 have already surrendered and hence were not arrested.The next hearing is on November 20 when charges will be framed.

Delhi Confidential: InDemandExpress News Service | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:25 am
Elections in Haryana are yet to take place but political parties of various hues are already reaching out to one another for possible post-poll alliances in the event of a hung House. Kuldeep Bishnoi’s Haryana Janhit Congress, whose alliance with the BJP snapped few months ago, seems to be the most preferred choice of major parties. However, Bishnoi is keeping his cards close to his chest and has decided to wait for the results before deciding which way to go.
OLD LINKS
When the NDA government came to power at the Centre, many expected RSS workers, especially the self-styled ones, to try and use excuses to stake claim to various offices. However, the reasons being extended by many lawyers and retired high court judges to seek various appointments have become a topic of discussion in the corridors of power. A former HC judge, for example, told senior BJP leaders about his old Sangh links to seek the appointment of his lawyer-son as a law officer. There are also instances of lawyers’ résumés landing up in Shastri Bhawan for appointment as standing counsel due to their RSS links also abound. The government, however, is not ready to move in a hurry.
EXPANSION MODE
With all the extra work the Prime Minister’s Office has appropriated to itself, it is finding the need to expand. It is said to be looking for extra space in the South Block. The casualty is likely to be the Ministry of External Affairs, which is also housed in the same building. It is learnt that the PMO has asked the MEA to vacate at least four rooms. MEA, incidentally, has got a brand new building for itself, the Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan on Janpath, but many officers prefer to work from their old offices in South Block. The PMO’s request might force some more MEA officials to finally shift to their new offices.
MORE CHANGES
Another round of governors’ appointments is said to be around the corner now that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is back from the US. The states where a change is expected are Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and J&K. Madhya Pradesh Governor Ram Naresh Yadav has been in office since 2011, while N N Vohra has been J&K Governor since 2008. K Rosaiah of Tamil Nadu is a former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.

How I did it: Bre Pettis of MakerBot0
It dawned on us that we were a company when we started doing payroll and paying taxes. And then people started using MakerBot as a verb, like, “I'm going to MakerBot this.” We hit a huge emotional milestone when we announced that everyone was getting health insurance. We had about 80 people at that point. I remember telling everyone, and people started to cry. Now they could get sick and have babies. For me, that was an important day.
We started the company with a very experimental business model. We were super open source, which in many cases is like a religious phenomenon. People believe in sharing and in a world without money — and that worked for us in the beginning. But once the Replicator launched, clones started popping up. Somebody ran a Kickstarter that was like, “MakerBot makes the best printers, and they're open source, so I'm going to make them in China, and I'll sell them to you for half!”
We love our community, and we love sharing, but we had taken this utopian business model all the way to the edge. If we hadn't changed course, it would have destroyed the company. So we stopped sharing our designs. Everybody who had a business in the open-source community was like, “Of course, you have to do this,” but to the super-open-source folks, we were cast out of heaven. That was a stressful, painful decision, but, in the end, it allowed us to continue to innovate. For me, the big mission has always been to make 3-D printing accessible to everyone. That's the important thing.
We raised $10 million in 2011. Our rule was, we wouldn't accept money from anybody we didn't want to have dinner with. One of our investors introduced me to Jenny Lawton, an entrepreneur who had run several companies. She put HR infrastructure into place and helped us hire a lot more people. She's now president.
I was out raising money to go public a year ago when Stratasys suggested joining forces. It made sense: Stratasys makes the industrial printers we lusted after when we started the company, and our desktop solution would make Stratasys very full spectrum. The merger allowed us to focus on innovating and growing instead of the distraction of going public.
Before we merged with Stratasys, I gathered the team together to create the MakerBot Way, which is a document that sums up who we are. Stuff like “We do what we say we're going to do” and “We have a greater purpose here.” We've done a great job at maintaining our culture as we have scaled up. Even with more than 500 employees, we still have a scrappy feel.
One of my psychoses is that I feel like I can do anything. Actually, I believe anybody can do and make anything, even things that don't exist. The making isn't the hard part; it's having faith. If you do only reasonable things, you'll never start your own business. It takes vision — a belief that you'll be able to do the things you have no idea how to do.

What s Trey Gowdy s End Game With BenghaziTrey Gowdy Captains Benghazi Investigation As The Anti-Issa
Posted:
reddit
WASHINGTON -- As he strode into the hearing room in the Capitol Hill visitor's center on Sept. 16, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chair of the special congressional committee investigating the 2012 attack in Benghazi, made a quick beeline to a member of the crowd.
It wasn't a fellow lawmaker. They were already on the dais waiting to begin the first open hearing. Nor was it one of the roughly dozen reporters on the side of the room. Rather, it was an aide to Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Gowdy's minority-party counterpart, who had grabbed the chairman's attention before official business began.
Gowdy tapped the aide on the shoulder, said a brief hello, and was on his way. The exchange lasted no more than a few seconds.
"Are you buddies?" The Huffington Post asked the aide later.
"Oh yeah," came the response.
They aren't. But those fleeting niceties were an indication that the hearing wouldn't be the firestorm that had been expected. Gowdy, far from the pugnacious interrogator he had shown himself to be in prior settings, wasn't spoiling for a fight that morning.
Instead, the proceedings were nearly as straightforward and professional as that greeting. Nearly. Over the course of several hours, State Department officials were grilled on American security and the findings of the Accountability Review Board, or ARB, which had been commissioned to look at what went wrong when militants attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, killing Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. It was meticulous and, at times, snoozy. Stories produced by the attending press corps were similar: Gowdy's management had surprised -- not for the fireworks, but for the lack of drama.
For those who worked with Gowdy before he was a hot-shot member of Congress, this wasn't surprising at all.
Long before his 2010 election to Congress, Gowdy was a well-regarded federal prosecutor in South Carolina. He tried cases mostly involving narcotics -- once estimating that drug crimes made up 90 percent of his workload -- but also robberies, child pornography, the first federal murder case in upstate South Carolina in more than a quarter-century, and even a criminal who made "America's Most Wanted."
Those who worked with with him when he was an assistant U.S. attorney, and later after he was elected as a solicitor -- South Carolina's equivalent of a district attorney -- praised his demeanor and approach. He was a showman, for sure, personally handling trials as solicitor, even though his job was more managerial. But he was disarming inside a courtroom and serious about the work.
John Delgado was one of Gowdy's legal sparring partners in South Carolina. Delgado, a "yellow dog" Democrat who "can't wait to put a Hillary sign" in his yard, said during an interview with The Huffington Post over the summer that Gowdy was "very personable, forthright individual." Those times when they'd argue drug cases in the federal courthouse in Greenville, South Carolina, Gowdy would deploy the type of interpersonal skills that would serve him well as a politician.
"He got up in front of the jury -- this is the South, this is just the way we do things -- and I remember Trey saying, 'First thing I want to say is good morning to y'all!" Delgado said. "And the jury responded 'Good morning!' It just flows out of him."
Despite their political disagreements, Delgado called Gowdy a "very capable prosecutor" who was "measured, well-prepared, nuanced, and yet most, most willing to preach to his choir." The guy, he said, "knows his audience."
Beattie Ashmore, a former federal prosecutor who worked a large number of drug cases with Gowdy, had similar recollections. He remembered Gowdy being "incredibly diplomatic and talented in the courtroom" and said he expects the Benghazi hearings to be handled in a similar manner.
"Trey will be prepared, Trey will be tenacious," Ashmore said. "I'm not a D.C. guy, but I watch CNN and Fox News like everybody else. I've seen my friend Trey on YouTube, that's his style. He's able to ask you the most offensive question that one could ever be asked and do it in a vanilla-flavored way."
Sometimes there are other flavors. For all his charm and prosecutorial acumen, Gowdy is ambitious. It's a trait that defined his professional conduct, even during his South Carolina days.
"I do recall him saying to me one time that 'Either next year at this time I'm gonna be in private practice … or a United States congressman,'" said Delgado. "He was making plans then."
Perceptions of Gowdy as a fast-moving grandstander followed him to Congress. He came into office on the 2010 tea party wave, and his penchant for creating camera-ready moments quickly became a trademark, alongside his erratic hair styles.
Sitting on the House Oversight Committee, Gowdy pestered witnesses. Basic criticisms about the Obama administration were turned into over-the-top polemics about the country's crumbling legal foundations. He insisted that Lois Lerner, a top IRS official, had forfeited her Fifth Amendment rights by delivering an opening statement to the committee before going silent -- a strand of legal logic that lawyers found curious. He railed against Attorney General Eric Holder before voting to hold him in contempt of Congress for not turning over documents in connection with a botched federal gun-running investigation. More than anything else, he delivered scathing broadsides about Benghazi.
So when House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) announced that Gowdy would chair a special investigation into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack, Democrats reacted with eye-rolling. And, for a moment, it seemed their suspicions would be confirmed. Gowdy said he would demand answers to questions that had already been asked, and got into trouble for framing the investigation as a court trial, with him, naturally, playing the role of lead prosecutor.
But as quickly as the guffaws started, they stopped. Months passed with barely a peep out of the usually vocal Gowdy. Skeptics saw it as the logical evolution of a manufactured crisis -- once the headlines died down, so too did the actual work. But Gowdy's office said the lack of pomp is by design.
"When all is said and done, Chairman Gowdy intends to lead the committee in a manner that produces a final accounting that is worthy of the sacrifice made by the four brave Americans we lost in Benghazi and worthy of the trust of all our citizens regardless of their political leanings," Gowdy's spokesman, Jamal Ware, told The Huffington Post. "He has said repeatedly, to anyone willing to listen, he wants this process to be viewed as fair."
The truth about the committee's progress likely lies somewhere in the middle. Some Democrats worry that Gowdy's patient approach is just a ruse, and that he'll pounce more forcefully once the 2016 campaign comes around and Hillary Clinton is running. Others have complained that the committee lacks basic organizational structure. According to aides, there have been no business meetings to discuss the scope or timetable of the investigation. The committee has a divided staff (20 for Republicans, 10 for Democrats) and budget (same proportional breakdown).
"This Select Committee was created in May because there was an urgent need to address all of these 'unanswered questions' about the attacks," said one Democratic aide. "They were allocated $3.3 million just for this year to do this. And here it is September and the committee is holding its first public hearing and it is on a Democrat's idea."
For Gowdy's defenders, there is an operational explanation for the slow pace. Investigators have been going through previous testimony and reports to avoid duplication. They've built classified systems, which takes time, met with victims' family members, and, according to several sources, held classified briefings.
Deliberativeness is also done for the sake of legitimacy. Though no one would admit it on the record, Gowdy clearly is contrasting himself with Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) As chair of the Oversight Committee, Issa has been a bombastic thorn in the side of the Obama administration. He runs investigations with little patience, cutting off microphones and leaking incomplete materials. He has a toxic relationship with Democrats.
Gowdy has contributed to that dynamic with his own theatrics. But according to sources close to him, he also recognized the pitfalls of that approach. While Issa proved adept at winning news cycles, his investigations often have been tainted by the perception of partisanship, so much so that the findings have suffered from instantaneous distrust.
"The emphasis [for Gowdy] is on making this as boring as possible," one source close to the committee put it.
Those in Gowdy's office have flicked away talk of the Issa contrast, in part because they see his committee as different in objective. But if you read between the lines, it's hard to not see it as a motivating force.
"As a prosecutor, Chairman Gowdy learned the importance of preparation and the necessity of thoroughness," said Ware, his spokesman. "He also learned that process matters as much as the final result. Having the facts but lacking credibility accomplishes nothing. That is one of the reasons why the Chairman has emphasized conducting this process in a fair, fact-driven manner to ensure the final outcome of the Committee’s investigation is beyond reproach."
That Gowdy wants to distinguish his style was evident from the first hearing. During opening statements, he leaned back in his chair, head jutted forward, giving him an inquisitive glare. While other members looked at their papers and tablets, he never turned away. When it came time to ask questions, he deferred, letting others take the first whacks. More than one aide noted that it was distinctively un-Issa-like to cede the opening spotlight.
When it came time for Gowdy to ask questions, however, the courtliness began to fade. He read witnesses portions of a document that outlined needs to beef up security at the U.S. compound.
"Do you know what that's from?" he pressed Gregory Starr, the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, who worked briefly under Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state.
"I believe it’s part of the ARB report," said Starr.
"From 1999," Gowdy said, emphasizing the numbers for effect.
In a brief moment, Gowdy had deftly cast the promises of post-Benghazi reforms as the usual platitudes that follow a crisis. It was a classic performance. Like the prosecutor working a South Carolina courtroom, Gowdy had spent hours winning the trust of the crowd, before going in for the kill.
As the committee ramps up, old associates expect more to come.
"I'm really looking forward to seeing former Secretary Clinton and Trey square off," Delgado said. "That's gonna be very interesting."

Why You Shouldn t Be  Optimistic  About Corporate  Tax ReformAccording to an article in The Hill this week, " WH adviser 'optimistic' for corporate tax reform ":
A top economic official in the White House on Tuesday expressed confidence that the next Congress can pass corporate tax reform.
... Obama has proposed lowering the corporate statutory rate from 35 percent to the high-20s while eliminating many deductions. Camp also proposed to lower the rate, but down to the mid-20s.
Camp has proposed shielding most of the profits corporations make offshore from U.S. taxation, while Obama has called for a minimum tax on global earnings.
Why is it that any time you hear the word "reform" coming out of Washington, it always ends badly for about 99 percent of us? They talk about entitlement "reform" -- meaning cutting Social Security and Medicare. They talk about regulation "reform" -- meaning our food and workplaces are going to be less safe. They talk about spending "reform" -- meaning doing less of the things that make We the People's lives better. (They never "reform" the military budget. It is more than double what it was when "W" Bush took office. Because we have to defend against the Soviet Union.)
"Reform" is lobbyist-speak for opening up the floodgates, hanging the flags out, lighting the savings accounts on fire, letting dozens of blackbirds fly out of the pie, letting the horses out of the barn and generally fleecing the citizenry.
"Reform" is politician-speak for "time to start the money flowing our way because the favors are going to be flowing your way."
Some numbers:
Corporate profits are the highest ever.
The corporate tax portion of federal revenue dropped from around 32 percent in 1952 to around 8.9 percent now.
Corporate taxes have fallen from about 6 percent of GDP then to less than 2 percent now.
Corporate taxes used to be 52.8 percent, then 48 percent then 46 percent. Then we did "tax reform" and lowered that to 35 percent.
Corporations are holding around $2 trillion "outside of the country" to dodge taxes. That represents up to $700 trillion in taxes owed.
Corporations "strip income" by having a non-U.S. affiliate "loan" money to a U.S.-based affiliate. The interest is deductible from US income so taxes are lower.
As of 2007, the top 1 percent owned 50.9 percent of all stocks, bonds, and mutual fund assets. The top 10 percent owned 90.3 percent. The bottom 50 percent owned 0.5 percent. Things have concentrated upward since then, with all economic gains from the recovery going to the top few.
And now they're trying to "reform" the corporate tax system once again.There are some actual reforms that are actually needed.
Current tax laws actually give a tax break to companies to help them move jobs and facilities out of the country! In July Senate Republicans filibustered to kill a bill that would stop this.
Current tax laws give huge tax subsidies to oil companies. Senate Republicans filibustered to kill a bill that would stop this. (and did it again )
Current tax laws let companies "defer" taxes on profits made outside the U.S. A simple 5 percent-per-year surtax on this deferred income would stop this and raise literally hundreds of billions of dollars for our schools, courts, roads, and other public assets.
Corporate taxes have fallen from about 6 percent of GDP to less than 2 percent. It's time to reverse that and restore funding for infrastructure, courts, schools, etc., boost Social Security and other programs that make OUR lives better.
What do you think the odds are that we will get actual "reform" that will actually make things better?
It's The Money
Everyone know why things are this way. It's the money. The money is allowed to buy influence in our system, and those with the most money are able to buy the most influence. Giant multinational corporations (and the billionaires behind them) have the most money, so they can buy even more tax breaks which means they have even more money so they can buy even more influence.
Politicians get the money to run all of those nasty, lying, smear ads that trick people -- or if they don't trick people they convince people to stay home and not vote. And when they do get voted out of office they go to their reward : a big-money job with the corporations (and the billionaires behind them) who they were helping while in office.( The Nation explains, in " When a Congressman Becomes a Lobbyist, He Gets a 1,452 Percent Raise (On Average)." CBS's 60 Minutes explains in " Under the Influence .")
Here's an idea. How about a new rule: People involved in making national policy can't be getting money or planning on future money from the beneficiaries of that policy. In other words, if you are involved in setting corporate tax rates, you're not allowed to be getting money from corporations now, or hoping to leave government and get money from corporations and/or billionaires. Period.
We should ban people in government from taking jobs (or "speaking fees" or stock or jobs at "institutes" funded by corporations or any other payoffs) that pay significantly more than they make now for a period of maybe seven years.
We should call "campaign donations" from interested parties what they are: bribery. If a company is giving shareholder money to a campaign, an "independent" campaign, even a "think tank" that is actually helping a politician or political party, that is an attempt to purchase influence. Companies don't "speak," they engage in transactions. Companies do not give out their money expecting nothing in return. If companies -- or people -- are giving money to politicians and expecting something back, by law that is the definition of bribery.
Get the money out first. Then maybe we can get some actual reform that actually helps actual people.

New NAS study critical of eyewitness testimonyBy Radley Balko October 3 Follow @radleybalko
We’ve known for decades that eyewitness accounts of events are unreliable and that they generally become more unreliable over time. We’ve also long known that eyewitnesses are vulnerable to suggestion, particularly from authority figures. In short, social science and psychiatric studies have shown that our attention is fleeting, our recollection ephemeral and our memory malleable.
The video below is one of the more well-known examples of how easy it can be to miss key details of a scene while we’re distracted with other things. It’s a short test. If you haven’t already seen or read about it, you can take it right now before reading on.
Despite the fact that social science has been well aware of these problems for decades, eyewitness testimony is still considered particularly powerful in the courtroom. It is precisely because of these two characteristics of eyewitness evidence – that it flawed and subject to suggestion and that it nevertheless retains such power with juries – that the courts should go out of their way to make sure eyewitnesses have been properly vetted, and their testimony has been properly elicited.
The good news is that there are some simple procedures police and prosecutors can follow to vastly improve the integrity of eyewitness testimony. The bad news is that because these procedures result in fewer identifications, police and prosecutors have been reluctant to implement them. And the courts haven’t been all that interested in ensuring that they do. (Two exceptions are the state supreme courts in Oregon and New Jersey.) Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to rule that eyewitness identifications made under suggestive circumstances were a violation of a defendant’s due process rights. The vote was 8 to 1.
This week, a team of researchers at the National Academy of Sciences released a comprehensive report on eyewitness evidence. From the summary:
Research on factors that affect the accuracy of eyewitness identification procedures has given us an increasingly clear picture of how identifications are made, and more importantly, an improved understanding of the principled limits on vision and memory that can lead to failure of identification. Factors such as viewing conditions, duress, elevated emotions, and biases influence the visual perception experience. Perceptual experiences are stored by a system of memory that is highly malleable and continuously evolving, neither retaining nor divulging content in an informational vacuum. As such, the fidelity of our memories to actual events may be compromised by many factors at all stages of processing, from encoding to storage and retrieval. Unknown to the individual, memories are forgotten, reconstructed, updated, and distorted. Complicating the process further, policies governing law enforcement procedures for conducting and recording identifications are not standard, and policies and practices to address the issue of misidentification vary widely. These limitations can produce mistaken identifications with significant consequences.
Writing about the study in USA Today , Innocence Project co-founder Barry Scheck points out that 73 percent of the wrongful convictions so far overturned by DNA testing included false identification by eyewitnesses. More from Scheck:
The NAS report has endorsed several specific, science-based recommendations for law enforcement that are already in place in some jurisdictions about the way identification procedures should be conducted. Since witnesses often pick up inadvertent clues from the officer conducting a live or photo lineup, these procedures must be performed “blind” by an officer who is unaware of the identity of the suspect or who does not know the position of the suspect in the lineup. The witness should also be told that the perpetrator might or might not be present, and that the investigation will continue regardless of whether he or she identifies anyone.
The researchers also recommend that police take a confidence statement. The witness should be asked to describe in his or her own words how confident he or she is in the identification at the time the identification is made. This is critical for helping jurors evaluate the reliability of the identification when the case goes to trial. Witnesses’ confidence is often falsely inflated by confirming feedback by the time they testify at trial. Indeed, researchers recommend that the lineup be electronically recorded so there is a permanent record of what occurred.
Groups like Scheck leads have been making these recommendations for years now. Still, just 10 states now require them. Previous NAS studies on forensic specialties like  bullet lead composition  have made a pretty big splash. The studies helped overturn a number of wrongful convictions and led to procedural changes in police agencies and crime labs across the country, including at the FBI. On the other hand, the broader 2009 NSA study that cast doubt on a number of forensic specialties, including bite mark evidence and blood spatter analysis, hasn’t had the same impact. And previous revelations about sloppy crime lab work and bad forensics haven’t exactly led to government officials rushing to the courthouse to seek out and mitigate the harm done.
Eyewitness testimony reform could be a tough sell, both because it seems so powerful and convincing, and because it’s such a critical component of a large portion of police investigations. Still, Scheck seems optimistic that this study will convince more legislatures and police agencies to adopt the recommended procures to improve the quality of eyewitness testimony. Let’s hope he’s right.

Modi to begin Maharashtra campaign from Mundes turfUpdated: October 4, 2014 00:50 IST

Modi to begin Maharashtra campaign from Munde’s turf
Omar Rashid
regional elections
‘In a way, this is to pay homage to him’
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Saturday launch the BJP’s campaign in Maharashtra from Beed, the home turf of the late BJP leader Gopinath Munde, in the crucial Marathwada region.
Later in the day, Mr. Modi will address another public meeting in Aurangabad, also in Marathwada, and a third one in Mumbai.
“The elections would have been fought under the leadership of Gopinath Mundeji. In a way, this is to pay homage to him,” BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe told The Hindu on why Beed was chosen as the starting point of Mr. Modi’s campaign.
Observers believe that by evoking Mr. Munde, the BJP was trying to appeal to the OBC population in the State.
Mr. Munde’s sudden death earlier this year left a void in the BJP’s State leadership as he was considered a mass leader and a prominent OBC face.
The mantle of taking forward his legacy has been handed over to his daughter, MLA from Parli in Beed, Pankaja Munde-Palwe.
Observers believe that she is being promoted as a probable CM contender keeping in view the OBC constituency in the State.
While addressing a rally in Bhagwangad in Beed, BJP chief Amit Shah on Friday appealed to Maharashtra’s OBC community to “unite under” Mr. Palwe’s leadership and to “complete the unfinished work of Gopinath Munde for the welfare of the backward classes.”
“Under Mr. Modi’s leadership the Central government’s primary policy is to work for the welfare of the OBCs,” Mr. Shah told the crowd.
Though the BJP hopes to benefit from the sympathy factor over Munde, its campaign primarily relies on the appeal of Mr. Modi.
The BJP hopes to come to power on its own strength after it recently split with its long-time ally the Shiv Sena.
On Sunday, Mr. Modi will address rallies in Nashik, Sangli, Gondiya and Kolhapur and is expected to address more than 15 rallies in the State, which goes to the polls on October 15.

EasyJet soars on strike by Air France pilotsEasyJet soars on strike by Air France pilots
By AFP | 4 Oct, 2014, 01.04AM IST
EasyJet on Friday lifted its full-year profits forecast as a record-long strike by pilots at Air France caused passengers to switch to the no-frills British carrier
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: EasyJet on Friday lifted its full-year profits forecast as a record-long strike by pilots at Air France caused passengers to switch to the no-frills British carrier. EasyJet said income grew by about £5.0 million ($8.1 million, 6.4 million euros) thanks to the strike by pilots at Air France, while the British airline raised its 2014 earnings forecast also following a strong end to its financial year.
The British airline said it now expected pre-tax profit for the 12 months to September 30 of between £575 million and £580 million compared with the group's previous guidance of £545-£570 million.
"We finished the year strongly," EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall said in the company's trading update. "This has enabled EasyJet to deliver record profits for the fourth year in a row." The airline added that "the impact of the Air France pilots' strike in September is expected to increase easyJet's revenue by circa £5 million as Air France passengers switched to easyJet".
EasyJet had already said that 40% of its net profits would be in the form of dividends to shareholders. The group will publish its fullyear results on November 18. Air France's main pilots' union this week ended the longest strike in the carrier's history to allow talks over the contentious issue of the airline's low-cost subsidiary Transavia .
Air France sees Transavia's development as vital in the struggle to retain market share in the cut-throat medium-haul sector, which is steadily being overrun by nofrills airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair .
The two-week stoppage has meanwhile cost Air France more than $250 million.

Ebola in US: Global travel open to spread of...Ebola
(Liberian officials said…)
MONROVIA, Liberia: The arrival in the United States of a Liberian man infected with the Ebola virus shows how difficult it is to control or restrict the disease from spreading, and how porous procedures are in a world of globalized air travel.
Liberian officials said Thursday that they planned to prosecute the passenger, Thomas E Duncan , for lying on an airport questionnaire about not having contact with a person infected with Ebola before his travel - a pivotal part of the country's screening process. "He lied on his form," said Binyah Kesselly, chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority . "If he had answered truthfully," he added, Duncan would not have been allowed to leave the country. Duncan took three planes as he flew from Monrovia, the Liberian capital, to Dallas last month, connecting in Brussels and Washington.
His journey illustrates just how easily the disease can travel and how thin the procedures are, relying heavily on the honesty of travelers and the diligence of airport workers. Some experts say the system, given its inherent weaknesses, could quickly be overwhelmed by the rapidly spreading disease. Duncan's temperature was taken by an airport worker in Monrovia who had been trained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, registering a non-feverish 97.3, the agency's director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, said Thursday.
But Duncan did not acknowledge during that screening that he had helped carry a woman stricken with the symptoms of Ebola to and from a hospital just days before, Liberian officials said. That woman died, as did her brother, who helped carry her with Duncan.
The Obama administration has not changed procedures on air travel in light of the Dallas case, beyond stressing its existing guidance to airlines and border agents to be on the lookout for sick passengers.
Customs agents at airports, for instance, conduct "passive surveillance" for overt signs of illnesses, including visual observation and questioning of entering passengers at all U.S. ports of entry. There are "screening procedures in place at our border," Josh Earnest , the White House press secretary, told reporters Wednesday. "There is nothing about this case that we know so far that would indicate any weakness or any flaws in that system right now."
In an interview, Frieden defended the screening process at airports in the United States, saying the costs of a more comprehensive process would not be worth the potential benefits.
"Like any intervention, there are upsides and downsides," Frieden said. There are a lot of downsides. You slow travel. You end up costing people money." The best way to keep the virus out of the United States is to eradicate it at its source - in Africa, he said. But in the meantime, he noted, the risk of another infected person coming to the United States is "not zero."
"Whatever we do, we are not going to get to zero risk in the U.S. until the outbreak is over in Africa," Frieden said. "People may be uncomfortable with it, but we tell it like it is."
Liberia had no screening at its airports before July 26, adding measures only after an American-Liberian man, who was visibly sick and vomited during his flight, took the disease to Nigeria, resulting in 20 infections and eight deaths.
Now, Liberia says passengers' temperatures are taken twice by scanning their foreheads with infrared thermometers, stopping anyone with a fever over 99.5 degrees, in addition to the required health questionnaire. Officials acknowledged that the controls rely in part on the honesty of travelers, but they argued that until symptoms are evident, there were few other options. "There is nothing else we could do short of quarantining people who want to travel 21 days before their departure," Kesselly said, referring to the maximum incubation period for Ebola. But of the 9,624 passengers who have flown out of Monrovia, only two have been flagged for additional screening.
Some health experts said that number seemed suspiciously low, saying that it was "highly unlikely" or "not possible" that such a minuscule percentage of travelers would have fevers, even if unrelated to Ebola. Another expert said it was plausible that airport workers were taking passengers' temperatures and reading the numbers correctly, but questioned the accuracy of the devices and pointed out that such methods had not necessarily worked in the past.

regional elections
Party leaders credit him with putting Sena on the digital map
Aaditya Thackeray, 24, son of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray ranks second on the list of 36 star campaigners of the party for the Maharashtra Assembly election.
The scion’s rise in the Sena has been meteoric — a cause of envy for the kin of other political bigwigs in the State.
He first emerged in the public domain as a poet on social issues in three languages —English, Hindi and Marathi. He was 17 then.
But his claim to fame, or notoriety, came three years later, when he lent support to the ranks of Sena activists in burning Rohinton Mistry’s work Such a Long Journey, which forced the University of Mumbai to withdraw the book from its curriculum.
A few weeks later, at the Sena’s Dasara rally, his grandfather and Sena founder, Bal Thackeray, launched him in politics by anointing him as the president of the newly formed Yuva Sena.
Mission 150
Sena’s “Mission 150” for the Assembly election, akin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Mission 272” for the Lok Sabha election, was his brainchild.
It became a serious bone of contention between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Sena, leading to the break-up of a 25-year-old alliance.
Following the split with the Sena, the BJP’s Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Eknath Khadse hinted that Aaditya and his “childish” Mission 150 caused the break-up.

Wall Street calms down ahead of the jobs report(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)
After three days of selling, investors are now in a wait-and-see mode.
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor 500-stock index were flat Thursday after each fell more than one percent the day before. Stocks looked poised to continue the sell off Thursday morning, but they rebounded in the afternoon in what financial advisers say is a sign that investors are waiting on the jobs report for a new hint on the strength of the economy.
While it’s not clear what would satisfy investors, advisers say that a mediocre report might be the best way to keep the markets from skidding further. A robust jobs report could put investors on edge by raising concerns that the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates sooner than anticipated. A weak showing may spark fears that the economy is losing its footing.
“Best case, at least in the short term, would be kind of a middle-of-the-road report,” says Curtis Holden, a senior investment officer at Tanglewood Wealth Management, a firm in Houston with $830 million in assets under management.
Small-cap stocks, which are issued by younger companies and are generally considered to be higher risk, saw a 1 percent gain after reaching correction territory Wednesday. The threshold, which means small-cap stocks are more than 10 percent off their July highs, is viewed as a sign that there may not be as much upside left in the broader stock market, which is now up nearly 200 percent from its March 2009 lows.
Investors may be sticking with large-cap stocks in an effort to tamper volatility in their portfolios, financial advisers say. Because they are typically viewed as more stable, large-cap stocks are expected to hold up better than those issued by smaller companies in an environment of slow growth, says Scott Wren, a senior equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors. “You want to be in the stocks that have better balance sheets, easier access to credit,” Wren says, “not a one-trick pony.”
Advisers are bracing for more volatility caused in part by worries over slower growth in Europe and Asia and concerns over the Federal Reserve’s next move. Investors may also be growing more cautious following a barrage of bad headlines: including the arrival of Ebola in the United States, the pro-democracy rallies in Hong Kong and trouble in the Middle East.
The dramatic market reaction to news abroad may be caused by concerns over the strength of the financial market at home, advisers say. After a five-year climb, some people may be worried that the market doesn’t have much more room to run.
“I think people are looking at the same chart that I am and they’re wondering ‘how long can this go on?’” says Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, an investment management firm with about $1.35 billion in assets.
There’s no knowing how markets will behave, but advisers say they are expecting more volatility. September and October are historically rocky months for equity performance, Wren says. Stocks tend to perk up by November, December and January, but that isn’t always the case, he cautions. And investors shouldn’t make decisions based on those trends, but rather focus on whether they think the economy is on more stable ground.
“The economy is good, not great,” Wren says. “When you have modest growth and a modest inflation environment, stocks can do fine in that.”
Few advisers recommend getting out of the market completely, but with the chance that volatility may pick up, it might be a good time to re-assess portfolios. Holden recommends people move into assets that tend to have more stable performance. That means buying more U.S. stocks versus those from Europe and emerging market countries and relying more on large-cap stocks than small-cap stocks, he says.
“We’re not going to tell someone they need to run for the hills,” Holden says. “Don’t make rash or drastic moves. But at the same time, know what you own. Know why it’s there.”

Reptiles May Be More Like Us Than You Ever Thoughtreddit
They may not be the brightest bulbs in the terrarium, but surprising new research shows for the first time ever that reptiles are able to learn by watching others (see video above). Known as " social imitation ," this ability is something commonly associated primarily with humans and certain other primates.
Reptiles learn by watching? Before you know it, they'll be saying sharks have personalities.
Actually, another new study has shown that sharks do have personalities, but we'll get to that later.
For the reptile study, which was published in the journal Animal Cognition, European researchers devised a simple experiment involving a dozen bearded dragons and a wooden board with a sliding wire door. The researchers looked to see whether the lizards could learn to use the door simply by watching a "demonstrator" lizard trained to use the door to get to a yummy mealworm.
What happened? Not just one but all eight of the observer lizards successfully copied the actions of the demonstrator. None of the lizards in a control group that hadn't seen the demonstrator were able to open the door.
"This research suggests that the bearded dragon is capable of social learning that cannot be explained by simple mechanisms--such as an individual being drawn to a certain location because they observed another in that location or through observational learning," Dr. Anna Wilkinson of the University of Lincoln's School of Life Sciences in England and the leader of the research team, said in a written statement. "The finding is not compatible with the claim that only humans, and to a lesser extent great apes, are able to imitate."
The shark study was led by the University of Exeter and the Marine Biological Association in England and published in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. It showed for the first time ever that some sharks have strong social connections with others of their species while others tend to be aquatic wallflowers, according to a written statement issued by Exeter University.
The researchers reached the surprising conclusion after observing the social interactions of 10 groups of captive small-spotted catsharks in three different types of habitat.
"We found that even though the sizes of the groups forming changed, socially well-connected individuals remained well-connected under each new habitat," Dr. David Jacoby, a behavioral ecologist now at the Institute of Zoology in London and one of the researchers, said in a written statement. "In other words, their social network positions were repeated through time and across different habitats."
Maybe it's time to show a bit more respect to our scaly friends.

Payments 101: Consumer Tips for Safe Shoppingreddit
Here are a few numbers to consider. Last year's Target breach, which resulted in the loss of more than 40 million customer debit and credit cards, has cost the company more than $148 million dollars. This doesn't included losses related to lost business and impact on the company's stock price. Just last month, Home Depot announced another major breach. While it is not yet known how many customers were affected, some estimate that more than 60 million card numbers were lost. Both of these breaches were caused by a variant of the same malware that steals account data from the business' payment terminals.
If anything, both of these breaches serve as a huge wake-up call for both businesses and consumers when it comes to in-store transactions. Businesses need to determine how to protect their systems from these types of breaches. There are a number of solutions in the works, a few of which I wrote about in my last Payments 101 post . However, consumers also need to learn best practices to better protect themselves.
There are a few simple things that consumers can do to get started and protect their purchases from these types of breaches:
Keep an eye on your credit and debit statements for odd charges. This includes small transactions. Cyber criminals often test accounts with small transactions to make sure the cards are active before making a big purchase. If you see a suspicious transaction, report it immediately and request a new card.
Consider an alternate payment option. Consider paying with credit cards or cash when making in-store purchases. Cash can't be breached and credit card companies cannot hold you liable for fraudulent purchases made on your card. This makes it a lot easier to fix fraudulent charges compared to a fraudulent debit card charge where money is taken directly out of your account. In this case, you have to personally recoup any losses from your bank. Cash, credit and debit cards are not the only payment options. With last week's announcement of Apple Pay, near-field communication (NFC) is front and center as a more secure payment option. NFC is a type of radio communication that allows you to use your smartphone to make payments at NFC-enabled payment terminals. Because the NFC radio is extremely short range (i.e. you have to touch the phone to a terminal to make a payment), many experts say that NFC is inherently more secure than your typical card transaction.
Keep an eye on credit and debit card numbers and personal information with an identity protection service. The Home Depot breach resulted in the loss payment information. The Target breach also included personal information like email addresses, names and home addresses. An identity protection service can alert you when your payment cards and personal information has been compromised. Both Home Depot and Target have offered a free year of identity protection to affected shoppers. Take advantage of these offers.
Believe it or not, these simple security practices can help protect your personal information in the event of a massive data breach. Educate yourself and others on best security practices so your information is safe when the next breach happens.

U.S. stocks rally on strong jobs reportBy Paul R. La Monica   @lamonicabuzz October 3, 2014: 12:42 PM ET
 
Unemployment rate falls below 6%
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
You really have to nitpick to find something negative in the September jobs report . It is good news for the economy.
And here's some more good news. Wall Street liked the jobs report too. Stocks rose more than 1% Friday.
It's a pleasant surprise to see investors celebrating the good jobs numbers. It actually wouldn't have been a huge shock if stocks sold off.
If the labor market (and broader economy) continues to pick up steam, that may increase the chances of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in the spring of 2015 instead of waiting until the summer.
Investors cheered the strong jobs report. Good news was needed after a tough couple of weeks for stocks.
Wall Street has been obsessed with trying to pinpoint exactly when the Fed will hike rates and some investors worry that Fed chair Janet Yellen will turn out the lights on the easy money party too soon.
But let's be honest. The September jobs numbers are not so strong that Yellen is going to have nightmares about inflation. Wage growth is still relatively sluggish -- 2% over the past 12 months. And consumer prices are up only about 1.7%. That's not a sign of an economy in danger of overheating.
Paul Atkinson, head of north American equities for Aberdeen Asset Management, said he does not think the jobs report was good enough to change the Fed's plans for gradual rate hikes beginning in the summer. That will keep Wall Street happy.
To that end, the bond market didn't react as if rate hikes were any more imminent either. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose only slightly Friday, a sign that fixed-income investors are not expecting significant inflation or big moves in rates anytime soon.
 
How to tell when investors are scared
The September jobs report also confirms what the rest of the world seems to know. The U.S. economy is much stronger than the rest of the world. To that end, the dollar gained even more ground against other major currencies on Friday.
Mark Lindbloom, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management, an investment firm that focuses on bonds, said that the jobs numbers were a reminder to foreign investors that growth in the U.S. should be solid, if not spectacular.
Lindbloom said the economy could grow at a 2% to 3% clip annually for a few years, which is much better than the projections for Europe and Japan. He expects more money to keep flowing into U.S. assets as a result.
This is encouraging. But will it last? Axl Rose said/sang/screamed it best. "Where do we go? Where do we go now? Where do we go?" (Welcome to the Wall Street Jungle. We've got fun and games indeed.)
It's been a tough few weeks for the stock market. And CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index remained in Extreme Fear mode Friday even though stocks were higher.
So it's hard to tell if the jobs report will signal an end to the recent market volatility. Investors could wake up next week and decide to once again worry about Ebola, ISIS, Europe's economic malaise and Hong Kong protests.
Keep in mind that stocks popped last Friday as well. Maybe investors are really embracing the TGIF mentality before the weekend?
But Atkinson is not concerned. He said that stocks still look attractive because earnings expectations are reasonable and profits continue to grow at a healthy pace. He added that valuations, while not cheap, are fair.
As for the numerous geopolitical concerns, Atkinson said they will be of "secondary importance" unless oil prices spike. And the opposite is happening. Crude prices are now below $90 despite what's going on in Iraq and Syria.
And as long as energy prices don't shoot higher, Atkinson said that should help stimulate the economy and lead to higher stock prices in the process.

Abercrombie & Fitchs absurd dress code is going all the way to the Supreme CourtFashion
October 3, 2014
Abercrombie & Fitch has been around for more than 100 years, but it’s just over the past two decades that the US retailer has established its famously preppy, rumpled, hormonally charged aesthetic. A meticulous employee dress code, or “look policy”—which doesn’t, apparently, prohibit young men from appearing shirtless in sweatpants—helps to maintain the mood in stores. Now, that policy will bring Abercrombie all the way to the US Supreme Court .
In 2008 Samantha Elauf, then 17 years old, wore her hijab when she interviewed for a job at an Abercrombie store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Heather Cooke, a 23-year-old sales manager, assumed—but didn’t ask—that Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons. Although Abercrombie’s “look policy” states a limited exception will be made for religious head coverings, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that in not asking, Cooke violated EEOC guidelines, and essentially created a loophole allowing for religious discrimination.
Abercrombie has been accused of discrimination in the past: In 2005, the company paid $40 million to several thousand minority and female plaintiffs, to settle a case brought for racial and sexual discrimination. In 2008, the EEOC sued on behalf of 18-year-old Halla Banafa , in a case similar to Elauf’s. In 2011, 19-year-old Umme-Hani Khan sued after Abercrombie’s sister brand Hollister  fired her for refusing to remove her headscarf .
In Elauf’s case, which the Supreme Court has agreed to hear , a manager gave Elauf a low score in the interview’s “appearance and sense of style category.” If that sounds like an absurd category for a professional evaluation, as opposed to a beauty pageant, consider that the company refers to sales associates as “models”—hence, the “look policy.”
Abercrombie & Fitch has not responded to our requests for its most current policy, but here are a few verbatim excerpts from one Buzzfeed published last year :
Clothing choices should be clean and classic, not provocative (e.g., tanks should be worn with an undergarment).
No associate is permitted to wear extreme hairstyles or color.
[Hair] highlights should be blended and there should be no streaks, blocks or chunks of contrasting colors.
[Hair] highlights should appear as if the hair is naturally highlighted by the sun and not manipulated by unnatural bleaching methods.
Earrings should not be larger than a dime and should not dangle.
No more than two earrings in each ear can can be worn at a time for women.
The shape of the earring must be in good taste.
Men are not allowed to wear earrings.
No other pierced jewelry is appropriate.
Fingernails should not extend more than 1/4 inch beyond the tip of the finger.
If polish is worn, it should be clear or natural in color.
Foundation, base or blush can only be worn if it is applied in such a way as to look completely natural.
Eyebrow pencil, eye liner, and eye shadow are acceptable in natural color.
Lipstick should be very natural in color.
Facial hair, including mustaches, goatees, and beards, is unacceptable.
Clothing should be consistent with the season (e.g., a heavy wool turtleneck sweater should not be worn in 90 degree heat).
Associates are prohibited from wearing apparel that is clearly that of a competitor.

Netflixs Hollywood guy on changing the movie businessBy Cecilia Kang October 3 Follow @ceciliakang
“We need to compete for consumer attention with the experience and the quality of the film, not the preciousness of access,” says Ted Sarandos, chief content officer of Netflix. (Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes)
Netflix took on Blockbuster and the cable television industry, and now it has its sights on the movie business. The streaming giant says the old models in place for how entertainment reaches consumers need to change. And the only way to see real change is for Netflix to back its own production of movies and television shows. This week, Netflix  announced its first drive into the film industry with deals to create and exclusively distribute four Adam Sandler movies and the sequel to “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.”
We talked to Netflix’s top guy in Hollywood, chief content officer, Ted Sarandos . Here’s an edited version of our chat on Thursday.
Cecilia Kang: What’s going on here?  Netflix is now a Hollywood studio?
Ted Sarandos: I’d say it’s both radical and evolutionary at the same time. I’ve said this in the past: The existing business models for movies are hugely frustrating to today’s on-demand consumer. The notion that you can create a brand, use the Internet as a global marketing vehicle and then deny access to that product for up to one year seems remarkably out of step with consumers.
C.K.: Why are things changing now?
T.S.: Everyone has a big stake in the status quo, and incumbents don’t like change. A movie does 90 percent of business in theaters in the first three weeks. And then it is held back from home entertainment for four to six months. And then for Netflix, HBO and Showtime for an additional four to six months. It’s meant to preserve an aura of premiumness because you can’t get to it. But I want to assert that we need to compete for consumer attention with the experience and the quality of the film, not the preciousness of access. The experience has to come first.
C.K.: Where does that leave the movie theater experience? How did you break the chain of windowing of releases?
T.S.: By providing people more choice, people will decide in which way they will consume a movie. We have pay-TV deals with Disney – that starts next year – and deals with  DreamWorks and the Weinstein Company that are traditional windowed deals that we decided a while ago. And yet people would think movies on Netflix are old. What they are expressing is that those windows make them old. It becomes a very expensive and passive movie experience. And I don’t think I can meaningfully move the windows around (in that model). We’ve squeezed them as successfully from outside as possible. The Disney deal accelerated the windows by a couple months. The Weinstein deal accelerated the windows by a couple months. But the ability to launch a show — all episodes at once — we couldn’t have done with someone else’s content. We had to produce the programming ourselves.
C.K.: Analysts stress that for long-term success, it is important for you to own the copyrights to your content. That isn’t the case with your television dramas like “House of Cards.” How about with the “Crouching Tiger” sequel and the four Adam Sandler movies announced this week?
T.S.: I’m not trying to be cagey here, within the contract itself, it’s all about confidentiality. (But) we should think that there is a near perpetual license.
C.K.: When you say perpetual is that synonymous with indefinite?
T.S.: Future revenue streams for the film are contemplated in the agreement.
Q: Why Adam Sandler? Does his humor actually translate overseas? Many of his jokes feel awfully inside-baseball within U.S. culture.
T.S.: I’m so glad you asked. The thing that makes this so exciting is we always looked and are thrilled by how popular his films are in North America. Every country we launch in, his library performs through the roof. Every time, there are multiple films (of Sandler’s) in the top 20 films in the country. People are quick to say “Blended” didn’t fair well domestically. But it made almost $140 million, more of it outside the U.S. He is hugely popular in Germany and in the U.S.
C.K.: What kind of films is he making for you? I saw the “O’Doyle Rules!” reference in the news release, which makes me believe that inside joke is a nod to that expression he uses in other comedies.
T.S.: Sandler can move seamlessly from funny and silly physical comedy and something completely different. Look at his body of work, which includes romantic comedy. It’s great for co-viewing. We want him to keep doing more of what he does. When you think of an Adam Sandler movie, these are going to be Adam Sandler movies.

Indias IPR fully compliant with WTO norms: ...Agriculture Investment Innovation
(The government, however,…)
NEW DELHI: India's intellectual property regime is fully compliant with WTO norms, the government said on Friday, two days after the two countries decided to set up a high-level working group on IPR during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit to sort out the contentious issue.
"India has consistently pointed out that the intellectual property right (IPR) legal regime in India is fully TRIPS compliant and that any issues to be discussed have to be discussed in bilateral forums like Trade Policy Forum (TPF)," the department of industrial policy and promotion said in a release.
The US is conducting an 'out of cycle review' on India's IPR regime based on its Special 301 report. It had in April threatened to downgrade India from 'priority watch list' to 'priority foreign country', the lowest grade.
The government, however, said that US agreeing to talk IPR through a bilateral mechanism is a reaffirmation of India's stand that the issue does not need unilateral action. India has refused to be subjected to unilateral action proposed by the US under the Special 301 report, an annual report on IPR under US Trade Act.
The joint statement, issued during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to America, has said, "...The leaders committed to establish an annual high level IP Working Group with appropriate decision making and technical level meetings as a part of the TPF". The statement on the IPR issue will only strengthen the bilateral institutional mechanism, DIPP said. "The joint statement issued merely reiterates whatever has existed in the earlier TPF," it added.
IPR issues are critical for both the countries and India has been repeatedly raising the issue of copyright piracy and misappropriation of traditional knowledge with the US, said government.
The US-India TPF is the principal trade dialogue body between the countries. It has five focus groups: Agriculture, Investment, Innovation and Creativity, Services, and Tariff and Non-Tariff Barriers. TPF has not met since 2010.
"It is appropriate to mention that there already exists the Innovation and Creativity Focus Group in the TPF since 2010 to consult each other no less than twice a year on improving IPRs protection and enforcement, enhancing awareness of IPRs, fostering innovation and creativity, and increasing collaboration between US and Indian innovators," it said.
American companies, particularly from the pharma sector, had alleged that Indian IPR laws discriminate against US companies and violate global norms.
On April 30, the US had brought out the Special 301 report, an annual review of the global state of IPR protection and enforcement, in which it has classified India as a 'priority watch list country'.
On the report, India has said that the Special 301 process is a unilateral measure taken by the US under their Trade Act, 1974 to create pressure on countries to increase IPR protection beyond the TRIPS agreement. New Delhi has always maintained that its IPR regime is fully compliant with all international laws.

Just more than 83% of Coca-Cola's shareholders approved the so-called 2014 equity plan at its annual meeting in April. Coca-Cola's board said that it had taken shareholders' voices into account when devising the changes.

Why Big Pharma Probably Won t Cure Ebolareddit
A colorized transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of a Ebola virus virion.  (Photo by Center for Disease Control (CDC) via Getty Images)
The Ebola virus may be getting closer to Americans than ever, but don't expect big American drug companies to come to the rescue.
Instead, small biotech firms , academics and government agencies are leading the search for an Ebola cure.
Over the past few weeks, an Ebola outbreak in Africa has resulted in over 1,600 cases of the disease , including more than 880 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Two American relief workers became the first people treated for Ebola in the United States, and New York City is suffering its own (hopefully unfounded) Ebola scare.
But as Ebola spreads, pharmaceutical giants are sitting this one out. That's mainly because treating a disease that affects a relatively small number of people who typically don’t have a lot of money doesn’t offer a great return on investment for profit-driven companies, experts told The Huffington Post Tuesday. It's unclear how much profit it would take to get Big Pharma interested in finding an Ebola cure, but right now such a project could well be a money-loser, they said.
“You’re just talking a small number of cases,” said Thomas Geisbert, a professor at the University of Texas medical branch at Galveston whose lab is researching possible treatments for Ebola . Geisbert noted that the number of Ebola patients right now pales in comparison to the number of people suffering from diseases like malaria and cancer. “Who are they going to sell it to?” he said of an Ebola treatment.
Smaller biotech firms are more likely to be drawn to the project of finding a cure or vaccine thanks to the lure of government funding, good PR and the chance to make an impact, Geisbert said.
ZMapp, the experimental treatment reportedly given to the American patients, has only been tested on animals and isn’t approved by the Food & Drug Administration for broad use, Bloomberg reported. The drug, which helps the immune system fight the disease, is the result of a collaboration of small biotech firms -- some with fewer than 10 employees -- U.S. Army funding and Canadian public health research .
A tiny San Diego company called Mapp Biopharmaceutical came up with the chemical structure for the treatment. And Kentucky BioProcessing, which was acquired by tobacco giant Reynolds American earlier this year, produced the drug using tobacco plants.
A handful of other companies are also working with government funding to develop a cure for the deadly disease, according to CNNMoney . The government typically gets involved in these efforts with national defense in mind: Without a cure stockpile, a bioterrorist could possibly wreak havoc using Ebola, smallpox or other diseases, said Jason Kolbert, the head of health care equity research at the Maxim Group, an investment banking firm.
Geisbert said he isn’t sure if increased awareness of Ebola will push Big Pharma to develop a cure, but he’s already seen a “flurry of activity” by the government trying to advance the development of treatments.
If the ZMapp treatment is a consistent success, then that might spur bigger companies to invest more money in finding a cure, said Charles Arntzen, a professor of infectious disease at Arizona State University. Arntzen received government funding to research an Ebola vaccine through the same grant that offered money to the scientists behind Mapp Biopharmaceutical.
Arntzen said he's gotten pretty far along in his research -- all the way to animal testing -- but hasn't been able to move to clinical human trials to test side effects because he needs "the big money" from a larger company.
“We just haven’t found a commercial interest in developing a vaccine,” he said.

Who Will NYC s New Living Wage Policy Benefit Mostreddit
New York City's new wage hike is much-needed relief in a city beset by skyrocketing living costs and mounting income inequality. But for many families -- especially those with multiple children -- the raise still won't get them a living wage.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order on Tuesday raising wages for an estimated 18,000 employees. The raise applies to employees who work on economic development projects that get at least $1 million in subsidies from the city. These workers will earn $13.13 per hour if they don't receive benefits and $11.50 if they do.
The raise will boost childless single people and couples above a living wage. It will help people with one child achieve roughly the living-wage threshold. But larger families -- especially those with single parents -- will still fall far below living-wage levels, according to cost-of-living calculations by MIT researchers , as you can see from the chart below.
The living-wage numbers in the chart are based on the cost of living in Manhattan in New York County, one of the most expensive places in the country. "Poverty wage" is defined by MIT as the level someone needs to earn to reach the federal poverty line , which is $23,850 for a family of four. "Living wage" encompasses the costs of local childcare, medical insurance, rent and other essentials. To get the fairest comparison, we compared these wage levels to wages under de Blasio's plan for people who don't get benefits such as health insurance. Theoretically, because the city's raise for these people is higher, it should get them closer to a living wage. It doesn't always:
De Blasio's New Wages Are A Step In The Right Direction For Many Low-Income Families | Create Infographics
It's also worth noting that for couples to earn as much as is shown in the graphs, both adults would need to work full-time jobs.
The New York State legislature and Governor Andrew Cuomo are currently considering a plan that would boost wages to $10.10 per hour, up from its current statewide level of $8.00 per hour (this wage is scheduled to go up to $8.75 on December 31). The proposed plan would also let municipalities raise the wage up to 30 percent above the state wage floor, so New York City could set its own minimum at $13.13 per hour.
“We cannot continue to allow rampant and growing income inequality,” Mr. de Blasio told The New York Times. “Every tool counts. If we reach 18,000 families with this tool and get them to a decent standard of living, that’s a game-changer for those families.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Coca-Cola is curtailing its pay plan for executives after shareholders including Warren Buffett called it excessive.
The world's largest beverage maker said Wednesday its long-term incentive program will now distribute the company's shares to a smaller group of executives, while the rest will be rewarded with cash bonuses instead.
That will mean the total shares authorized to be awarded under the plan will last longer. In addition, Coke said the mix of long-term equity awards will be adjusted to be more heavily weighted to performance shares, rather than stock options.
Coca-Cola's pay plan came under scrutiny earlier this year after Wintergreen Advisers called it a "raw deal" for shareholders, particularly in light of the company's slowing growth as it faces declining soda consumption in the U.S. and other parts of the world.
Wintergreen CEO Dave Winters had said the company's equity plan would transfer roughly $13 billion to management over the next four years.
In a statement Wednesday, Winters said, "Coca-Cola has finally conceded that the equity compensation plan it put to a vote of shareholders in April was outrageously excessive and inconsistent with past plans."
Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway is Coke's biggest shareholder, is a longtime critic of excessive pay packages. But he said Berkshire Hathaway didn't vote against the plan at Coca-Cola's annual meeting because he didn't want to publicly express disapproval of the company's management.
Afterward, however, Buffett said he discussed his concerns about the pay plan with Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent.
Buffett did not immediately respond Wednesday to questions sent to his assistant.
Last year, Kent was given a pay package worth $18.2 million, according to an Associated Press calculation. That was down 16 percent from the previous year because Coca-Cola failed to meet its own growth targets.
The Atlanta-based company also said it would increase transparency about its stock and option awards and formalize its practice of share repurchases to keep stockholders' stakes from being diluted.

A Solid Jobs Report as the Recovery Continues to Lift Employment... Though Not Yet Wagesreddit
September turned in strong jobs numbers as payrolls were up 248,000, surpassing expectations (sort of; see below), and the unemployment rate ticked down to a six-year low of 5.9 percent. August's initially disappointing payroll count of 142,000 was revised up to a more respectable 180,000, and the average work-week ticked up to 34.6 hours, a post-recession high and a clear sign of an improving labor market.
Analysts expected 215,000, but the BLS pointed out that about 20,000 grocery store workers were back on the payrolls in September after a work stoppage in August. Netting out this number, payrolls only slightly surpassed expectations.
You know my methods, Watson. It's useful to average out the monthly bips and bops in payrolls, so below I give you this month's version of JB's Jobs Day Smoother, showing average monthly job growth over the past three, six, and twelve months.
Source: My analysis of BLS data
The underlying pace of payroll job growth is around 220,000 per month, with a very slight deceleration in recent months. That's a solid, if not breakneck, pace that will continue to gradually tighten up the job market.
The last time the unemployment rate was below 6 percent was in July 2008. Moreover, while the labor force fell slightly (though statistically insignificantly) last month, the decline in the jobless rate over the past year has come for the "right" reason: more people finding work, not leaving the job market (you're only counted as unemployed if you're actively looking for work).
Let me unpack this observation a bit. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) -- the share of the 16 and up population either working or looking for work -- is a key variable to watch these days. It ticked down slightly last month, as noted, but as shown in the chart, has generally stabilized over the past year. This has two important implications.
Source: BLS
First, it suggests a strengthening job market as part of the decline in the LFPR over the recession and weak recovery was due to discouraged job seekers giving up hope. Second, as noted above, it means that recent declines in the jobless rate are due to more people getting jobs versus giving up the search.
While the report and the revisions clearly reflect an economic recovery that is reliably reaching the job market, I see at least two trouble spots to watch, both highly significant.
First, wage trends remain flat at 2%, just about the rate of inflation, implying a) stagnant buying power for most workers, and b) the tightening job market hasn't done much for workers' bargaining power.
Second, in a point I'll return to later in the morning, manufacturing employment has slowed notably over the past few months, adding zero jobs on net in September and October. This may be an early reaction to the strengthening of the dollar in recent months, which makes our manufactured exports more expensive in foreign markets (and imports cheaper).

The Race to Become Boutique: The Health Club Dilemmareddit
If you took a lay of the fitness landscape in New York City, you'd notice that mid-tier gyms, the $70-a-month independently-owned health clubs -- the gym industry's middle class, if you will -- has been hollowed out.
Look around: It's either Equinox or budget chains like Planet Fitness, and in between are the boutique fitness studios -- SoulCycle, FlyWheel, Pure Barre -- which are typically more expensive per visit than even the highest-end health club but offer classes on a pay-per-visit basis, so you won't find yourself shelling out $150 for a month when you've attended only one or two classes.
For many who have embraced the booming boutique fitness scene, the only thing preventing them dropping their gym membership all together is the amenities: There's something to be said for working out before work and having access to a Kiehls-packed locker room with showers, and something to be dreaded about cramming into the tiny locker rooms at most boutique studios and fighting for one of the three showers before settling for dry shampoo from a can.
Sensing that a growing number of people are forgoing their gym membership in favor of specialized experiences like boot camps or cycling studios, some gyms have begun partnering with smaller boutique studios, offering them temporary or permanent space and giving their customers access to the gym's amenities. In exchange, gyms receive foot traffic from the well-to-do clientele that boutique studios tend to attract and, in some cases, a cut of the studio's revenue.
For even the ultra-luxe, national brands, that revenue isn't trivial. DavidBartonGym moved CYC Fitness, a 2-year-old cycling studio with two locations outside New York, into the basement of its Astor Place location in January. "They are already covering 12 percent of our total rent and we are only eight months into the deal," said DavidBartonGym CEO Howard Brodsky. "We project that in 2015, CYC will cover between 16 percent and 22 percent of our total rent."
DavidBartonGym and CYC announced plans this week to open four more CYC studios inside different DavidBartonGym locations. CYC also said it will open its next studio later this year inside the Times Square Row NYC Hotel.
But as fast as new boutiques have sprouted up in Manhattan, independently-owned gyms have bit the dust, and Complete Body is among the last of its kind.
In 2010, Alex Reznik bought the gym's 19th street location, formerly known as the 19th Street Gym, a stomping ground for hardcore bodybuilders that was forced to shut down in 2009.
Today, Complete Body's Flatiron location sits at the epicenter of an explosion in boutique fitness studios. The number of leases signed for gym and studio space in Manhattan more than doubled last year to 22 from the nine that closed the previous year, according to deals tracked by Cushman & Wakefield.
Greg Tannor, a director at the real-estate services firm, says he's seen even greater demand this year for boutique fitness space, with a "tremendous amount of activity from spinning, rowing and Pilates studios."
Such boutiques have boxed in Complete Body on 19th street: SoulCycle moved in two doors down last year, and the Fhitting Room , a boutique studio that offers high-intensity training classes, set up shop across the street in July.
A few streets down, on Seventh Ave., Town Sports International, the parent company of New York Sports Club, opened BFX, or Boutique Fitness Experience , a 10,000-square-foot studio in June offering multiple kinds of classes, from spinning to yoga, taught by popular instructors poached from boutique brands in the area.
To stay relevant, Reznik recruited a number of up-and-coming fitness studios -- including Body Conceptions, 305 Fitness and In Fighting Shape -- to host classes inside the gym and pay by the hour for the rented space.
Similar arrangements exist across the city as growing numbers of homeless fitness studios squeeze into rented rooms within existing health clubs and dance centers, building up followings before taking permanent space. 305 Fitness , for instance, is opening its own 3,600-square-foot studio this month on West 8th Street.
As for Complete Body, its menu of classes has opened up new channels of revenue, Reznik said, from folks who come in off the street and pay the relatively high per-visit prices that nearby studios charge.
At DavidBartonGym, people who aren't members of the gym pay $25 per CYC class, while members get a reduced rate of $20 per class. Stephen Nitkin, CYC's CEO, says the studio is able to keep prices below the $30-40 price of most cycling classes in Manhattan because the location at DavidBartonGym costs CYC a third of what it would have cost to build and operate its own space.
And while the price of many fitness classes in Manhattan may seem outrageous, much like the cost of real estate in the city, many consumers seem willing to pay a premium for the cutting-edge workouts and the attention of instructors who have built up personal brands through widely-followed Instagram accounts and best-selling DVD sets.
In fact, on a national scale, boutique fitness facilities earned more than twice the amount commercial health clubs earned per customer in 2013, according to a report released this month by the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association and ClubIntel, a health club consulting firm.
The report's authors slice the industry as a whole into three segments. There is the commercial fitness-only facilities and nonprofit gyms like the YMCA, which comprise 80 percent of facilities in the U.S. These two segments have "adopted a strategy that embraces a low price point," the study found, with nearly 50 percent of members paying under $25 a month and less than 10 percent of members paying over $75 a month.
On the other other end of the spectrum, representing approximately 20 percent of the market, "are the boutique fitness facilities that are pursuing a high price value proposition," with between 20 percent and 40 percent of customers paying over $100 a month.
"Members appear willing to pay more for the personal interaction and sense of community that comprises many of the studio models," the study's authors wrote. "Facilities that are all about the equipment and access, basically renting out space to work out appear to be doomed to compete on price, essentially on the lowest price possible."
In other words, today's commercial health clubs are seemingly faced with two paths forward: Become boutique-y or become budget.

Brad Stone Tells Retailers That Amazon Can Kill Them or Teach Themreddit
If anybody knows Jeff Bezos and his Amazon empire, it's writer Brad Stone , who wrote a detailed book about the twin American icons and was introduced at the annual Shop.org Summit this week as a leading Bezosologist.
But if the e-commerce professionals packing Stone's keynote speech were looking for the sure way to beat the Amazon juggernaut , they weren't going to find it in that convention center ballroom. That's not to say there is no way to compete against the Seattle giant and we'll get to that in a minute. (Hint: It's not easy.)
First, think about this scene: A few hundred of Amazon's competitors crowding a cavernous room to hear tales of the guy who's got to be in the top five on the list of who makes them the most miserable. They listened politely as Stone, a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter who wrote, The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, said things like:
"Jeff might be one of the best strategists on the Internet today."
"Jeff was the guy who bet the biggest on the Internet and on the inevitability of rapid change that was going to alter the relationship between customers and companies."
"As you know grocery delivery services have been tried many times over the years and have mostly failed to become profitable. Amazon is leveraging all of its advantages to finally make it work."
But what are you going to say? It's basically true. Amazon is a formidable competitor in retail; and it also happens to be in the device game, the content game and in advertising and cloud services, newspapers, groceries and on and on.
Stone is a straight-shooter and so his talk certainly wasn't a Jeff lovefest. He talked about some of the less-than-flattering insights he gained while writing the book, like how it wasn't the other big retailers and Internet businesses that provided Amazon's stiffest competition as it grew into the $74 billion business it is today.
"Amazon's biggest challenge was never eBay or Walmart or Google or Apple," he says. "Amazon's biggest foe has always been chaos, the complexity in its own fulfillment centers."
And he offered an interesting explanation of Bezos' tendency to try new things, beyond selling and shipping products -- trying new things like the Kindle, the Fire phone , even delivery drones . It seems Bezos has given some thought to the way that big discount retailers grow to be feared and reviled; the way they attract bad publicity. And in a memo leaked to Stone, Bezos laid out the attributes that could inoculate Amazon from creating that sort of reaction.
"One of the ones that he settles on, as maybe being able to influence a good reputation, is being seen as an innovator, being seen as pioneers," Stone says. "So as long as you're not completely viewed as just extracting value, but you're inventing new things and adding value, then perhaps this is a way that Amazon can continue to be loved."
No question, Bezos has built an impressive empire, but turning back to the key interest of the retailers in the room, Stone says that Amazon's retail prowess hardly means it's game over.
"I have no special insights into what e-commerce businesses should do," he told the assembled. "I do think there is plenty of opportunity left in the e-commerce market."
Of course, the retailers listening know that. It's why they keep at it. Why they don't just fold up shop and go home. Amazon is a formidable foe, but also survivable.
Back to that hard part: In general, e-commerce retailers competing with Amazon need to find ways to differentiate themselves, to stand out in consumers' minds, to provide the kind of experience that supersedes price and builds loyalty.
"Today people seek authenticity, sustainability, uniqueness in what they wear and display in their homes," Stone says. "These are not necessarily the values that Amazon optimizes for."
He pointed to outlets like zulily, Wayfair and Etsy, that are "deeply focused on special product categories and are great at making and meeting promises to customers."
As for retailers looking for pointers, Stone had some surprising advice.
"In e-commerce in 2014, it's probably a pretty good strategy to watch Amazon and to learn from them," he says. "Make sure you're betting that the world will change rapidly, because it will. Master the chaos and complexity of your own operations, so you can make precise promises to customers. Invent the future you want to see. Find your own assets and leverage them."
Oh, and one more thing, Stone thought would help: Be a Bezosologist.

The Reason Why Countries Rise and Fallreddit
Today's world is going in circles seeking the antidote of growing their countries' economies, not realizing this very fact, which is also the reason why certain countries cannot produce multinational corporations. Politicians are not the solution, they are rather part of the challenge; this is a phenomena only mastered by the few who live in first world countries and very few from emerging markets.
Taking into consideration great thinkers like Dr. Tom Palmer and some professors from MIT, one notes when we look at all the wealthy societies of the world: Luxembourg, Switzerland and Japan. Not long ago they were desperately poor by contemporary standards. What made them rich?
Take Ghana and South Korea in 1960, when they had roughly equivalent per capita incomes. Not anymore; what was different between the two, why did Ghana stagnate and South Korea increased per capita income by over 30 times in one generation?
South Korea opened the market and joined GATT in 1965. Until then, you see flat economic performance and then there's an inflection point. It's really quite unmistakable. Look at the economic data from Fraser Institute of Canada -- they have an Economic Freedom of the World report, which finds consistently that countries that prosper are those that get the institutions right.
Oil is not a source of prosperity. Resource-rich countries, like Nigeria or the Democratic Republic of Congo stagnate. And then there are resource-poor countries that become fabulously wealthy like Hong Kong, and the Netherlands. There's nothing in the Netherlands, not even land, which they have to build out of the sea. But they've got the institutions right.
Since 1977 when the classical article of Meyer and Rowan was published, "Institutional Theory" surfaced and many intellectuals ran with the theory which underpinned the adaption of multinationals in different countries and further evolved as a template for countries to prosper economically. Institutional Theory has been the most successful theory to unlock unprecedented growth in any country, yes, taking note of different economic framework and political environments which affects how the theory is applied.
What are institutions exactly? North (1990, p. 3) offers the following definition: "Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction". He goes on to emphasize the key, implications of institutions since, "In consequence they structure incentives in human exchange, whether political, social, or economic".
A theory is not an answer in itself; a good theory doesn't change its mind, it doesn't apply only to some countries or companies, and not to others. It is a general statement of what, and why; rather than an answer, it's a directive statement for application like a formula that leads to an answer.
Countries with weak institutional theory applied find it challenging to produce globally competitive companies, and it's rare if they do. Many Zimbabwean multinationals are mostly headquartered in South Africa to expand globally.
Although, some recent contributions to growth theory emphasize the importance of economic policies, such as taxes, subsidies to research, barriers to technology adoption and human capital policy, they typically do not present an explanation for why there are differences in these policies across countries. Of primary importance to economic outcomes are the economic institutions in society such as the structure of property rights and perfection of markets.
Therefore, societies with economic institutions that facilitate and encourage factor of accumulation, innovation and the efficient allocation of resources will prosper; however, economic institutions are driven by political will power.

4 months after becoming CM  Naidu steps into newofficeN Chandrababu Naidu at his new office on Friday.
Written by Sreenivas Janyala | Hyderabad | Posted: October 4, 2014 2:46 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 10:10 am
Nearly four months after becoming the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, N Chandrababu Naidu finally stepped into his new office at the Secretariat’s L block here on Friday. With priests chanting prayers on the auspicious day of Vijayadashmi, the CM who has been mostly working out of his residence or the temporary office at Lake View Guesthouse, entered into the office on the 8th floor that has bullet-proof windows and the walls have a coat of blast-proof paint.
For the first time after bifurcation, both Naidu and Telangana CM K Chandrasekhara Rao will be working out of the same Secretariat complex, though from different blocks, in the joint capital.
Soon after stepping into his chamber, Naidu signed the Primary Sector Mission file which is one of the seven missions launched by his government. The CM said that the Vision 2029 of the state government is part of the primary sector mission whose comprehensive blueprint would be released on October 6.
Naidu entered into his chamber at 2.25 pm along with Chief Secretary I Y R Krishna Rao, ministers Devineni Umamaheswara Rao and Ravella Kishore Babu, Adviser (communications) Parakala Prabhakar and his office employees. Nearly Rs 20 crore was spent to renovate and modify the 8th floor to create a spacious office for the Chief Minister with bulletproof walls and windows. His chamber is also coated with a paint that is blast-resistant.
There is a conference hall with video linkup, a huge visitor lounge and chambers for CMO officers on the same floor. Naidu was to initially have his office on the 7th floor of H block but he refused it later on because it did not suit his Vaastu requirements.

Don t fear hackers. Profit from themHow investors profit from hack attacks

Some investors aren’t just changing their passwords to avoid hackers. They’re embracing cyberattacks — and looking to profit from them.
Shares of cybersecurity firms, including VASCO Data Security (VDSI) , Fortinet (FTNT) and Red Hat (RHT) are attracting investors’ attention as it’s becoming more clear big companies will need to do more to secure their digital hatches. Shares of eight stocks in the security software industry — based on the very broad Russell 3000 index — are up an average of 15% this year.
The big winners Friday on the heels of the news of the latest breach against J.P. Morgan are Vasco, rising 8.1% to $20.26, Fortinet up 2.8% to $25.68 and Red Hat, up 1.9% to $58.47.
Cyberattacks are taking down the nation’s most venerable companies, including J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) , Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT) . Consumers are understandably concerned about what these attacks mean for their personal data privacy.
But investors are looking for opportunity, picking the right one can be tricky. There are eight major stocks to choose from in the security industry and investors are torn on which ones will win.
The biggest computer security player by far is Symantec (SYMC) , with a market value of $16 billion. Wall Street analysts are lukewarm on the stock, rating it a “hold” and setting an 18-month price target of $24.29, says S&P Capital IQ. That’s barely above the current price of $23.48. But New Constructs , a firm that rates stocks based on their projected future cash flows, rates the stock an “attractive.”
Meanwhile, VASCO continues to be one of the hottest security stocks going. Shares are up 162% this year and up 8% just today alone to $20.21 Friday. Analysts are bullish on the stock, rating it “outperform” and holding an 18-month price target of $22. But New Constructs ranks the stock “dangerous.”
The security stock the analysts are hottest on its FireEye. Analysts are forecasting the stock to gain 57% over the next 18 months. But it hasn’t panned out this year, as the stock as skidded 35%.
So, definitely change your passwords. But be sure to do your own due diligence on these computer security stocks.
Below are the 8 security software stocks in the Russell 3000 index:

Chicago issues demolition permit for Wrigley Field bleachers8
Cubs spokesman Julian Green said Friday that bleacher renovations will start Monday. The left-field and right-field bleachers will be demolished and rebuilt as part of a $375 million stadium renovation plan. An additional $200 million in upgrades are planned for the surrounding area.
  Open link
Parts of Waveland and Sheffield avenues are closed for the renovations and won't reopen until the spring. Utility work around the stadium has already begun.
The team plans to renovate the bleacher section. The overall project includes five outfield signs and two video boards by Opening Day next year.
With a permit issued, the Cubs could be hit with a lawsuit from the owners of nearby rooftop clubs who have said that outfield advertising signs would block their views and violate a revenue-sharing agreement they have with the Cubs. A spokesman for the Wrigleyville Rooftop Association declined to comment Friday.

This Burning Man Video Offers A Surreal Window Into An Alien Worldreddit
The many sights, sounds and feelings experienced at Burning Man can be too much for any one festivalgoer to process. The dusty, alien world is so surreal, in fact, it often cannot be described in words.
Fortunately, participant and photographer Ari Fararooy brought his camera to the event in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada to convey the experience through images.
"The whole week felt like a really trippy, lucid dream," says Fararooy in the video description . "I was so busy exploring and meeting people that I barely took my camera out (hence the minute long video)."
Though nothing could match the actual experience of being there, this video's slow movements over the artworks and costumed Burners, overlapped with the sounds of a didgeridoo, offer a small window into the unique pop-up city on the Playa.

Biyani s tie up with Amazon to help him boost sales  profitsBiyani's tie up with Amazon to help him boost sales, profits
Raghavendra Kamath & Anika Soni | Mumbai/New Delhi Oct 04, 2014 12:03 AM IST
Kishore Biyani’s Future group could generate higher volumes and improve profits through reduced fixed costs and supply-chain expenses if talks with Amazon go through.
Biyani is in talks with Amazon to sell his private labels and sharing back-end facilities.
On the other hand, Amazon would get a number of brands on its portal that would help it drive footfall, consultants said. The Future group has private labels across categories such as as apparel, food and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG).
“We are yet to finalise the name of the e-commerce players we will tie up with. It could be Amazon, Flipkart or anyone else, but there will soon be a tie-up,” Kishore Biyani, chief executive of the Future group, said.
“Our own online venture is part of our omni-channel strategy, which is an extension of physical retail. Our tie-up with an e-commerce player will be about the Future group entering into pure e-commerce. It is a significant move for us,” Biyani said. The group recently unveiled its omni-channel strategy to sell products.
“The Future group has many formats and operates in many categories. They need alternative channels to market their products. The deal with Amazon will give them new a channel to reach customers,” said Dipankar Halder, chief executive of PingStripe and former head of Bharti Retail supermarkets. “Besides volumes, it can also improve their profitability due to lower costs in operations,” he said.
Added Prashant Agarwal, joint managing director at Wazir Advisors, “Amazon today supplies goods across the country. The Future group can get access to all those cities without being present.” He said the Future group could drive cost efficiencies in logistics, supply chain and sourcing.
Amazon is also expected to gain from the deal. “The Future group’s distribution centres supply to stores across the country. Amazon can make use of those centres and reduce logistics costs,” said Halder of PingStripe.
According to Agarwal, Biyani’s private labels will also boost Amazon’s portfolio. “More the brands, more the footfalls. If Amazon seals the deal, it can sell many brands of the Future group online,” he said.

SC refuses urgent hearing plea of Sahara chiefSC refuses urgent hearing plea of Sahara chief
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 03, 2014 05:56 PM IST
The Supreme Court today declined to give an urgent hearing to the plea of jailed Sahara chief Subrata Roy seeking bail to attend the cremation and perform rituals relating to the death of his aunt.
The application was mentioned by Roy's advocates at the residence of Chief Justice H L Dattu who said that there is no urgency in the matter and it will come for hearing in the regular court.
Official sources said that Roy had sought relief for 15 days.
His aunt, who was staying with the Sahara chief's family, had died yesterday in Lucknow at the age of 90.
On Wednesday, Roy was sent back to his cell in Tihar jail at the end of the period granted by the Supreme Court to stay at an air conditioned facility in the complex to negotiate sale of his overseas luxury hotels.
The court had extended Roy's stay at the Tihar Jail conference room by 15 days on September 8 for him to sell the properties to raise Rs 10,000 crore to be deposited with Sebi for his bail.
The Supreme Court, on August 1 had allowed Roy and two of his group directors to use the fully air-conditioned conference room in Tihar jail complex for 10 days from August 5, within a given time lot of 6:00 am to 8:00 pm.
The meetings held by the group under the surveillance of CCTV cameras.
Roy, 65, was using the conference room with services like Wi-Fi and video-conferencing. He was allowed two laptops, two desktops, landline phones with STD/ISD facilities and a mobile phone.
Two secretarial and one technical person were also allowed to assist him. Roy has been lodged in Tihar Jail since March 4 this year.

Today magstripes are on the backs of millions of U.S.-issued credit and debit cards, where they hold all the information needed to produce a flawless counterfeit card—account number, expiration date, and a secret code called a CVV. That has made Forrest Parry’s invention one of the computer underground’s most prized targets—more valuable than anything on your hard drive. We were reminded of that last week, when Home Depot confirmed that 56 million shoppers had their credit card data siphoned from the big box retailer’s point-of-sale systems over six months. That’s 3,000 miles of magstripe, stolen three inches at a time.
The announcement makes the Home Depot breach the single largest known theft of credit card data in history, edging out the 40 million cards stolen from Target late last year, and about the same number taken from TJX in 2006. It may also be one of the last major credit card heists.
But more on that in a moment.
First, a bit of history: What happens to stolen bank card data hasn’t changed in 15 years—the hackers package it and sell it in bulk to the underground’s third-party resellers. Ten years ago it was the Ukrainian known as “ Maksik "; today it’s the Ukrainian known as “Rescator.” If Parry’s innovation was to take a bulk storage medium and literally slice it into a wallet-sized one, the computer underground has perfected the opposite process, compiling all those squirts of information into a big data play that would make Mark Zuckerberg envious.
Once it’s in an underground shop, card counterfeiters buy the magstripes they need—sometimes ordering by bank or ZIP code—and copy them onto fake cards using their own magstripe encoding machines. Then they use the cards to buy goods they can resell or dispatch crews to do the shopping for them in exchange for a cut of the profits.
Since about 2001, stolen magstripe swipes, or “dumps,” have been the pork bellies of a massive hacker commodities market, centered in Eastern Europe and stretching around the globe. Beyond the hackers who breach stores like Home Depot, and the resellers like Rescator who market the cards, there are vendors specializing in the hardware and material—plastic embossers, fake holograms, blank cards, magstripe encoders—needed to use the data and others who crank out professional fake IDs to help pass the fake cards. By the most conservative estimates, it all adds up to $11 billion in losses annually.
But the golden age of credit card fraud is drawing to a close, and history will regard Home Depot, TJX, Target, and all other breaches as a single massive exploit against one catastrophic security hole: The banks’ use of roughly 23 characters of magnetically encoded data as the sole authentication mechanism for a consumer payment infrastructure that generated 26.2 billion transactions in 2012 alone. Engineering students will study that gaffe with the astonished bemusement with which they view old footage of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge twisting in the wind.
The fatal problem with the credit card magstripe is that it’s only a container for unchanging, static data. And if static data is compromised anywhere in the processing chain, it can be passed around, copied, bought, and sold at will.
The solution has been available for years: Put logic in the card. Thanks to Moore’s law, an inexpensive tamper-resistant microprocessor fits comfortably in a space smaller than your driver’s license photo. With a computer on both edges of the transaction, you can employ cryptography and authenticate the card interactively, so that eavesdropping on the transaction gains you nothing. Just as IBM’s Parry made our wallets smarter by adding computer storage, a modern card is smarter still by having an entire computer onboard.
Now, after resisting it for 10 years because of the formidable transition costs, the U.S. is about to finally embrace the secure chip-based authentication system called EMV—the standard was pioneered by Europay, MasterCard, and Visa—that the rest of the world has already adopted. Pushed by mounting fraud costs, credit card companies have crafted incentives for merchants to switch to the sophisticated readers needed to accept the cards. “There was a lot of skepticism about whether it would ever happen in the U.S.,” says Michael Misasi, an analyst with the Mercator Advisory Group. “All of the data breaches that have happened have woken people up, and progress has been accelerating this year.” The first serious milestone is October 2015. By 2020 the swipe-and-sign magstripe reader will be as hard to find as the credit card impression rollers they supplanted.
By then, it’s probably safe to say, the entire idea of a credit or debit “card” will be quaint. With the newly announced Apple Pay joining Google Wallet as a real-life payment system, even the chip-based credit cards will be little more than a backup technology. Apple took some ribbing for announcing Apple Pay while its iCloud celebrity breaches were still in the news. But unlike cloud storage, the state of the art of retail payment is so poor today that Apple can’t possibly fail to improve it.
You can see where this is headed by looking at one of EMV’s early adopters. Since the U.K. deployed EMV “chip-and-PIN” cards in 2004, overall card fraud in that country has fallen 32 percent, from 504.8 million euro in losses that year to 341 million in 2011, according to the most recent figures from the U.K. Card Association .
There are two loopholes that kept criminals from being hit even harder by the chip cards. First, the U.K. cards still have magstripes so UK travelers can use them when visiting the U.S. Adaptable criminals in the U.K. began working with confederates in restaurants and shops, covertly swiping magstripes from customers and selling them to American crooks to use at primitive American point-of-sale terminals. These scams contributed as much as 80 million euro in foreign fraud charges on U.K. cards in 2011.
But that loophole will close once the U.S. switches over to EMV. The second, bigger, loophole is online fraud. Internet transactions aren’t made any safer by having a chip on your card, and in the U.K. and elsewhere criminals were able to make up much of what they lost by doubling down on fraudulent Web purchases.
But the end is nigh for online credit card fraud, too. Systems like Apple Pay and Visa’s newly announced Visa Token Service accomplish the same security goals as EMV, but also work online. They replace the static credit card number with a temporary token that changes every time. “Initially, Apple Pay’s tokenization will only be for in-app purchases from mobile phones,” says David Robertson, publisher of the respected payments industry newsletter The Nilson Report . “But over time that will broaden.”

Robertson agrees that the simultaneous arrival of EMV and tokenization in the U.S. will trigger a sea change in the underground. “There’s every reason to think that the industry will get ahead of the bad guys again,” he says.
None of this means cybercrime will become unprofitable. Skilled cybercriminals will still make tons of money in more elaborate scams, like account takeovers and identify theft. But the death of the magstripe will trigger a financial crisis in the unskilled ranks of the computer underground akin to what the mortgage collapse did to Wall Street. And Parry’s historic invention, so brilliant at the time, can relax into its long overdue retirement.

32 people killed in stampede in Patna during Dussehra event32 killed in stampede at Patna Dussehra celebrations
Press Trust of India | Patna Oct 04, 2014 12:32 AM IST
Thirty-two people, mostly women and children, were killed and several injured in a stampede on Friday evening in Patna, shortly after the Dussehra celebrations had ended.
Police said the tragedy occurred when people were returning after watching the Ravan Vadh ceremony at the Gandhi Maidan, where a huge crowd had gathered to witness the event.
“Among the dead, there were five or six children and around 20 women," said Patna District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma. He added around 15 people were injured and were being treated at a local hospital. Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manji was present at the Gandhi Maidan, where people watched an arrow setting fire to a 60-ft tall effigy of Ravan.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the Bihar CM to enquire about the stampede. Modi sanctioned Rs 2 lakh each for the kin of those killed. He also sanctioned Rs 50,000 for each of the critically injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.
According to eye witnesses, the incident happened at the Exhibition Road area near the Gandhi Maidan in the heart of the city, as some people in the crowd started jostling with each other to move forward.  Some said panic broke out following rumours that a live electric wire had fallen to the ground.
Slippers, shoes and footwear were seen strewn on a 500-metre stretch as people tried to flee from the scene.  
“There was so much rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over in the frenzy,” said Verma.

Bezos  Nadella say much the same  but so differentlyBezos, Nadella say much the same, but so differently
Nivedita Mookerji & Surabhi Agarwal | New Delhi Oct 04, 2014 12:32 AM IST
There are many similarities between the two. Both are chief executive officers (CEOs) of top American companies with a huge interest in India. Their companies are leaders in the technology space and their annual revenues are apart from each other by $10 billion. They are almost the same age.
But the two visiting business bosses - Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of the $75-billion e-commerce company Amazon and Satya Nadella, CEO of the $87-billion software firm Microsoft - with engineering degrees and a shared passion to invent and build things, could not have been more different in the way they came across through their interactions during the last few days in India.
Bezos kept his audience regaled at every forum with his explosive laughter, witty one-liners and showmanship, though he's known to be quite a taskmaster and at times a boss with cutting remarks. Nadella appeared modest and humble, but without any of the paraphernalia of a celebrity CEO, as an observer pointed out.
The difference was between a professional CEO and a founder perhaps, as well as the fact that Bezos was an American while Nadella still retained his Indian-ness in terms of personality, industry watchers commented. But, if style is kept aside, they spoke of values and principles that sounded similar.
"Slap me if I fall asleep," was Bezos' way of telling Business Standard reporters at the start of an interview on Sunday evening that he was jet-lagged and sleep-deprived. The founder of Amazon wore rolled-up sleeves, with no tie or jacket, while speaking to the media through the day at a Bangalore luxury hotel right in front of the company office.
Unlike other multinationals that believe in clockwork appointments when chief executives come from abroad, Bezos, 50, met many journalists ahead of time. That perhaps gave him some extra time to sleep after a day of back-to-back interviews and what must have been a tiring photo-shoot in sherwani, hanging out of a truck quite like the Virgin group's Richard Branson, making the Amazon boss the headline news across newspapers the next day.
He even flashed a $2-billion cheque, reminding the people of India that Amazon had just invested that amount in the country, double of what was raised by competitor Flipkart.
Satya Nadella, 47, who moved to the US to study computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after getting an engineering degree from the Manipal Institute of Technology in 1987, did not indulge in any starry gimmicks. There were hardly any media interviews either.
It was all very low-key, is how a person who tracked the Microsoft chief's India visit said. "Getting nostalgic about India was not on his agenda." While Nadella, dressed formally, did a 20-minute press conference in New Delhi earlier this week, there was no time for any question related to his years in India.
Bezos, on the other hand, took every opportunity to speak glowingly about his previous visit five years ago, when he vacationed with his then nine-year-old son. Even now, he made it a point to praise India's achievement in the Mars Orbiter Mission while pointing out his affinity for anything related to space, tracing back his interest to the Star Trek days.
"I will return to Seattle with an extra kick in my step," Bezos said. To sound positive about India, Bezos said his company did not think it was very difficult to do business in India, though the e-commerce sector, including Amazon, is facing many policy and tax challenges in the country. If Bezos said India was energetic, Nadella too said the energy and optimism in the country was palpable.
Nadella's India connect in business was more about launching data centres. In India for the first time since he succeeded Steve Ballmer as Microsoft boss in February, he spent as much time as possible in the company's offices. Like any other time when Nadella is in the news, his father, former bureaucrat BN Yugandhar, was hounded by the media with questions about his famous son. Outside his straight-jacketed meetings, Nadella was the chief guest at a media event and also gave a pep talk to students telling them to "love your job".
The talk with students was an interaction jointly held with Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani, and Nadella did let his guard down here. He took off his blazer as he gave several mantras to students: Live as if it's your last day, but learn as if you have to live forever. Nadella advised the youth to "fall in love with what you do. Then it doesn't feel like work!"
Speaking of himself, Nadella said when he was growing up, he had not anticipated that he would "go west of Mumbai". And then how he landed up in Wisconsin. It's not just been a journey of progress, but there have been so many ups and downs.
Failure is something that Bezos spoke about at length. There have been several failures at Amazon, he said at a conversation organised by business chamber Ficci. He's known for saying it's okay to commit mistakes, but not okay to be timid. In fact, Bezos too urged kids to "finish school" and love what they were doing. "It is still day one", is another famous quote from Bezos. While Nadella said it in a quieter way, Bezos conveyed the same in an animated style, interspersed with his characteristic laugh. Once after a great vacation "I came back to my office dancing," Bezos said, explaining what loving the job meant.
The Microsoft CEO is in no way just a geek, but has deep interest in literature, American and Indian poetry to be specific. Cricket is another love of his life. Bezos displayed his love for words too (so what if he quoted business magnate and investor Warren Buffett). "Warren Buffett has this fantastic quote: You can hold a ballet, and that's okay. And you can hold a rock concert, and that's okay too. But just don't hold a ballet and advertise that there's a rock concert.'' Just be clear about who you were and the investors would select, said Bezos.
Nadella focused on understanding the business operations here and speaking to company executives. Most of his conversations revolved around Microsoft's new strategy: mobile first, cloud first. It was so much of an official trip that he skipped visiting his school, Hyderabad Public School. According to people in the know, Nadella restricted his public appearances as he was still new to the job and was trying to bring the company back to its days of glory.
People who have interacted with him earlier describe Nadella as extremely down to earth. He hasn't changed much. "He manages to connect with his audiences without letting out too much emotion, especially if you compare with his predecessor Steve Ballmer, who was another extreme," said a Microsoft insider.
And, Bezos likes to be expressive, with large doses of theatrics. He spoke about his wife who loves him because he does the dishes; Amazon India having an uncle in the US who sends the money; he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi keeping the world balanced as they were in each other's countries at the same time; cutting out the noise while referring to competition; the need to obsess about customers; importance of thinking long-term. Many of these things were part of the letter Bezos wrote to Amazon shareholders way back in 1997, the year Amazon was listed. Those principles still work.

Many insurance cos headless as top executive...Many insurance companies headless as top executives quit amid pressure from stakeholders to raise revenues

(With the government raising…)
MUMBAI: At least six insurance companies , both in the private and public sectors, are headless as top executives turn their back on the profession amid rising pressure from stakeholders to raise revenues in a sluggish market to gain higher valuation when foreign insurers come calling. The spate of resignations makes it difficult for insurers to hire talent in an industry where state-run companies dominate, resulting in the private sector not nurturing leaders despite more than a decade of operations.
India First Life Insurance, a joint venture between Bank of Baroda, Andhra Bank and UK's Legal & General, L&T General Insurance, and Bharti AXA General Insurance are among companies whose chief executives have quit. Tata AIA Life Insurance has been looking for a CEO after Suresh Mahalingam quit in March.
Ajay Bimbhet of Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance is due to retire and the company is yet to announce a successor. Chandra Prasad, chairman and managing director of National Insurance, has retired. PNB Metlife, which saw the exit of Rajesh Relan, just hired Tarun Chug from ICICI Prudential to head its operations. "We have seen a few changes and some exits are on the cards," said Abizer DIwanji, partner and national leader, financial services, EY.
"There is ome performance pressure. Despite extensive tie-ups and investment over long period, some shareholders have not got the return they have desired." Although India offers a huge market for insurance companies, with less than 3% of the population covered, it is a tough market with the state-run Life Insurance Corporation dominating more than three fourths of the market. Furthermore, the private players have been concentrating only in cities, which have become a saturated market.
With the government raising the foreign holding limit to 49%, from 26%, stakeholders want to raise revenues and profits to get higher valuation for their holdings. India First, after almost five years of operations, has a 1.6% market share with first year premium of Rs 324 crore at quarter ended June.
Bharti AXA General is ranked 13th with a gross premium income of Rs 121 crore in the first quarter of FY 15, after being in business for six years.
An executive from a private sector insurance company said those shareholders putting pressure on executives to deliver returns in an extremely competitive market is one of the main reasons for exits at the top level.
"There is pressure to show topline growth," said one of the executives who did not want to be identified. "Foreign shareholders are willing to increase their stake and Indian promoters are looking forward to reduce stake at a higher valuation."

Gujarat govt halts SIT move against KodnanibailPrint
Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:17 am
The Gujarat government has denied permission to the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) to challenge the bail granted to former BJP minister Maya Kodnani, convicted for life in the 2002 Naroda Patiya riots.
A senior official from the SIT told The Indian Express that they would appeal once again to the state government since state is the prosecuting agency. Another official said it may approach the Supreme Court, given the state’s non-cooperation even in the appeal for enhancement of sentence for the prime accused in the Naroda Patiya case, in which Kodnani, Babu Bajrangi and others, were convicted.
“When we sought permission to appeal against awarding of life sentence to Kodnani and some other accused, the state government rejected our repeated requests. Next month we will inform the Supreme Court that state government is not cooperating,” said a senior official. In April 2013, the government allowed SIT to seek death penalty for Kodnani but in a month’s time it backtracked and refused to permit SIT to file an appeal.
In November 2013, Kodnani was granted bail on medical ground after which the Gujarat High Court rejected her plea to extend it. Later, she approached the Supreme Court which also refused to extend the bail. She had said that she was suffering from intestinal tuberculosis and underwent electroconvulsive therapy under anaesthesia. Sources in SIT said 10 days ago it received a letter from joint secretary, legal department, saying that “it doesn’t accept the request of SIT for challenging the bail”.

Probe team seeks tax details of 8leaseholdersPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubhaneshwar | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:16 am
While the Centre remains non-committal over ordering a CBI probe into the multi-crore mining scam in Orissa, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black money, headed by former SC judge M B Shah, has asked the Orissa government to find out about eight mining leaseholders who mined iron ore without any environment clearance.
The Shah commission’s report on Orissa mining scam said that between 1994 and 2012, eight leaseholders in Mayurbhanj district extracted 2.27 million tonnes of iron ore without forest and environment clearance. These leaseholders include Ghan-ashyam Mishra and Sons, Lal Trader and Agencies, B C Dagra, J K Choube, G S Choube, D C Dagra, Dinesh Chander Das and B K Das. Of them, Das mined a maximum of 4.85 lakh tonnes between 1994-95 and 2011-12. The mines were located in within a 10 km radius of the outer boundary of Simlipal National Park. None of the mining leases were approved by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife. The panel in its report submitted in June last year recommended cancellation of the leases.
In a letter to the Orissa government last month, SIT vice-chairman justice (retd) Arijit Pasayat asked the state to find out from chief commissioner of Income Tax in Bhubaneswar how these illegalities had been dealt with. The SIT asked the Central Board of Central Excise to find out if duties, along with penalty and interest, have been levied. Sources said the SIT is looking into possible cases of tax evasion by the leaseholders.

ACB officers tried to tutor me  allegeswhistleblowerPrint
Express News Service | Rajkot | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:15 am
In a twist to the investigation against suspended IAS officer Pradeep Sharma in a corruption case, the RTI activist who blew the whistle on the alleged corruption has refused to get his statement recorded, alleging that the investigating agency was trying to “tutor” him.
After arresting Sharma in Ahmedabad, Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officers brought him to Bhuj in Kutch Wednesday. The ACB also summoned Henry James Chacko, the RTI activist who first alleged corruption in land allotment by Sharma, for recording his statement the same day. But Chacko refused to get his statement recorded as the ACB officers wanted.
“An ACB man sat beside me with a laptop and officers asked me to give my statement. But I disagreed over the manner of recording it, suspecting the statement was drafted beforehand and the officers just wanted me to sign it,” Chacko, who works with the NGO All India Anti-Corruption and Crime Prevention Council, told The Indian Express Friday.
It was on the basis of an application by Chacko to ACB in 2010 that the anti-corruption watchdog initiated an inquiry against Sharma for allegedly allocating land to Welspun Gujarat Stahl Rohren Ltd below market rates for a textile factory in Anjar taluka of Kutch and causing a loss of Rs 1 crore to the state exchequer. Sharma was Collector of Kutch when the land was alloted in 2004.
According to the FIR filed by ACB, Sharma’s wife Shyamal was made a 30 per cent partner in Value Packaging, a firm which had a contract with Welspun to provide packaging material, in 2004. ACB alleged this was quid pro quo as she had not invested a single penny in the firm till 2008. But Value Packaging gave financial benefits worth Rs 29.5 lakh to Shyamal, who in turn routed some of the money to her husband.
But Chacko alleged that P Panneervel, then principal secretary in the revenue department, was as much guilty as Sharma. “It was Panneervel who authenticated the illegal land allotment by Sharma. His wife Deepika was also a partner in Value Packaging,” he alleged. Panneervel was unavailable for comment.
“When they asked me to give my statement, I asked for a copy of the FIR. But they refused to give me one. I told them I will give statement only if the FIR recorded facts that I had mentioned in my letter,” said Chacko. The ACB’s FIR filed against Sharma does not name Panneervel or his wife.
ACB Deputy SP Tribhovan Patel, who is investigating officer, said, “We had called him to give his statement but he refused. However, we have collected incriminating material from Collector’s office and a few other sources.”

Caught between legal basis and industry protests  NPPA loses pricingpowersPrint
Written by Surabhi | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:13 am
The government, in a sudden move late last month, withdrew the power of the drug price regulator – the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority — to cap prices of non-essential drugs. The decision came just days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States. The issue of intellectual property rights especially in pharmaceuticals have been a constant bugbear in the bilateral trade relations.
The Indian Express explains the role of the agency and the significance of the decision:
What does the NPPA do?
As the name suggests, the NPPA regulates prices of drugs by implementing the provisions of the Drug (Prices Control) Order (DPCO) in public interest. A part of the Union ministry of chemicals, fertilisers and pharmaceuticals, it also monitors the production and availability of drugs, tries to prevent and rectify any shortage of drugs in the country and also maintains data on export and import of drugs. It is, however, not responsible for licensing of drugs, which is done independently by the Drugs Controller General of India in the health ministry.
What are the drugs whose prices are monitored?
Under the DPCO, 2013, the NPPA is empowered to control prices of all 348 drugs that are listed in the National List of Essential Medicines. Prices are capped at an average of all medicines in the segment having more than one percent market share. For all other drugs, companies are free to decide the pricing. But in case of a shortage, emergency or extraordinary circumstances, paragraph 19 of the DPCO, 2013 authorises the NPPA to regulate prices of drugs and formulations beyond this list.
What was the government order?
In May, the NPPA had issued internal guidelines quoting Paragraph 19 of the order to fix prices of non-scheduled drugs in various therapeutic areas, including those for cancer, HIV/AIDS and diabetes, where the maximum retail prices often exceeds 25 per cent of simple average of medicines in those groups.
The NPPA also ought to control the launch price of non-scheduled formulations by capping the price of any new brand at the same level as the price of the highest brand in the segment.
Using these powers, the drug price regulator had in July capped prices of 108 non-essential drugs for diseases including heart ailments, diabetes, tuberculosis and cancer. Faced with industry protests, the department of pharmaceuticals also sought the law ministry’s opinion on the issue. On September 19, the department finally scrapped the guidelines and on September 22, the NPPA said it has complied with the order.
How will the action impact drug prices?
A number of industry associations had already approached the courts challenging the NPPA’s July order. Since then the Delhi High Court has also asked the regulator to show how it is exercising its power to cap prices of non-scheduled drugs. The pharma industry has supported the move and said it reduces arbitrariness as well as red-tapism.
However, since the withdrawal of the guidelines last month, prices of a number of the 108 drugs is reported to have registered a significant spike. Recent trends show that the price of continued…

Chautala ignores court notice on campaigntrailComments
Addressed rallies in about a dozen villages
Indian National Lok Dal president Om Prakash Chautala addressed nearly a dozen election rallies in Haryana on Friday, despite a High Court notice to him on a petition alleging he was misusing the terms of his bail.
Chautala, who is supposed to be getting treatment in hospital, travelled around the Uchana Kalan region in a bus plastered with election posters, campaigning for candidates of his party. His grandson, Dushyant Chautala, is the INLD candidate for the Uchana Kalan seat, from where Chautala himself was elected in 2009.
Chautala is barred from contesting elections following his conviction in the Junior Basic Training (JBT) teachers recruitment scam, and has been lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail since January 2013. He has been given bail on health grounds until October 16.
On September 25, Chautala addressed a massive public rally in Jind to mark the 100th birth anniversary of INLD founder Chaudhary Devi Lal, following which a petition was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking cancellation of his bail. On October 1, the court asked both CBI — which investigated the scam, in which over 3,000 teachers were illegally appointed in 1999-2000 — and Chautala seeking their responses.
“Why has CBI not taken note of all this (election campaign)? CBI does not seem to be aggrieved by this,” the HC had observed.
Chautala began his campaign from Shahpur village in Jind district on Friday, where a large crowd greeted him by raising INLD slogans at the bus stand. He told villagers, “You know how I am feeling. I have been away from you for about 20 months. I came here because I wanted to see you all. Despite being locked up in Tihar jail, I worry about you. That is why I have sent Dushyant to you. I am sure that you will ensure his victory.”
Besides Shahpur and Uchana Kalan, Chautala addressed rallies in Rajkhera, Khapar, Baroda, Jheel, Budayan, Surbura, Kabracha, Taarkhan, Uchana Mandi and some other villages.

Former Infosys employee files new lawsuit fordamagesPrint
Reuters | Mumbai | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:11 am
A former Infosys Ltd employee responsible for starting a US investigation into the company’s visa practices has filed another lawsuit demanding damages for alleged wrongful termination.
US national Jack Palmer, who was employed by Infosys in Alabama, said in the lawsuit filed on Thursday with a New Jersey court that he had been discriminated against because he flagged that the company was flouting US visa rules.
The lawsuit, seen by Reuters, did not specify how much damages Palmer was seeking. He had previously tried to take Infosys to court, but his earlier case was dismissed in August 2012.
“Palmer resigned in 2013 November and released the company from the charges he has alleged in the complaint. We believe this is without any legal merit and will vigorously defend this complaint,” an Infosys spokeswoman told Reuters.
Last year, Infosys paid $34 million to end an investigation related to the widespread practice by Indian firms of flying workers to client sites in the United States on temporary visas. US authorities had been looking into Infosys’ use of visas since 2011.
Employment visas are a politically charged topic in the United States, especially those related to Indian IT services companies that are seen as taking jobs away from Americans.

Indian women s kabbadi team win Asiad goldIndian women's team beat Iran for successive Asiad gold
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Fri 3 Oct, 2014

Incheon, Oct 3 (IANS) Indian women's team beat Iran 31-21 for its second successive kabaddi gold medal at the Asian Games here Friday.
India had won the top prize in Guangzhou four years ago -- the first time women's kabaddi was introduced at the Asiad.
India didn't have it easy and were made to work hard for the win by the Iranians, their only real competition in the tournament.
A neck and neck start saw both teams defend extremely well. But the Indian defence came out on top to exact 13 outs, including two 'lona' points, that gave them a 15-11 lead after the first half.
Iran, in contrast, had just eight outs and three bonus points. They failed to get even a single 'lona' point.
India's supremacy started to show in the second half as they slowly started increasing the gap.
It was again the Indian defenders who stole the show and registered 14 outs and two more 'lona' points as Iran failed to make an improvement to their first half effort and had to settle for the silver.
The Indian men's team, who have dominated the Asiad winning all the previous six gold medals since kabaddi's inclusion in 1990, are in action later in the day in the gold medal match also against Iran.

Wall Street up after payrolls  but on track for down weekWall Street up after payrolls, but on track for down week
By Reuters | 3 Oct, 2014, 08.01PM IST
The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 6 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 12 new highs and 13 new lows.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: US stocks were higher on Friday after the September jobs report came in ahead of expectations, though major indexes remained on track for a second straight weekly decline.
The day's gains were broad, with nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors rising on the day, led by healthcare and financial names. The only declining group, utilities, down 0.3 per cent, is considered a defensive play.
The non-farm payroll report showed 248,000 jobs added in the month, considerably more than the 215,000 that had been expected. August's number was revised up to 180,000 from 142,000. The report eased concerns about the pace of economic growth, and was also not seen as so strong that it would influence the Federal Reserve's consideration of how soon to raise interest rates.
Equities have been volatile of late, with recent trading largely driven by the first diagnosis of a patient with Ebola in the United States. Major indexes have seen sharp intraday swings, with the S&P 500 seeing larger-than-average daily point moves every day this week.
"We're looking at a pretty sound fundamental picture, which has us tilted towards the upside, but that doesn't preclude any sharp pullback," said Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research at MV Financial in Bethesda, who added that any pullback would likely be short.
Despite the declines this week, investors have continued a trend of buying on dips. After falling as much as 2.9 per cent this week, at one point dropping under its 150-day moving average - a level it had not breached since November 2012 - the S&P has recovered much of those losses and is now down 1.4 per cent.
The Dow is down 1.3 per cent for the week while the Nasdaq is down 1.4 per cent. It is the second straight weekly decline for all three indexes.
The Dow Jones industrial average was rising 91.46 points, or 0.54 per cent, to 16,892.51, the S&P 500 was gaining 9.85 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 1,956.02 and the Nasdaq Composite was adding 24.00 points, or 0.54 per cent, to 4,454.20.
Advancing issues were outnumbering declining ones on the NYSE by 1,885 to 890, for a 2.12-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,737 issues were rising and 519 falling for a 3.35-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 6 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 12 new highs and 13 new lows.

US job growth is rising solidly, so why isn't pay?

(Economists regard stagnant…)
WASHINGTON: Where are the pay raises?
Employers in the United States are hiring at a brisk pace. Unemployment has sunk to a nearly healthy rate. Jobs are being filled across a range of industries.
Yet the September jobs report released Friday contained a puzzling fact: Paychecks still aren't growing.
Economists regard stagnant wages as a red flag for the 5-year-old recovery. Robust job growth has typically fueled rising wages. And without higher pay, workers have less money to spend and save, and that, in turn, keeps the economy from strengthening further.
Whatever meager pay raises most workers have received in this recovery have been all but eaten up by low inflation. The average hourly wage for non-management workers has remained $20.67 for two months. It's risen just 2.3 percent year-over-year, just slightly above inflation.
It just might be the pivotal challenge for families as well as for the economy. The size of a paycheck shapes budgets for consumers, whose spending accounts for most of the U.S. economy's activity.
Weak pay gains, along with lower-than-normal inflation, will also influence when the Federal Reserve decides to start raising interest rates. Without more pay raises spreading across the economy, the Fed has less pressure to raise a key short-term rate from its record low near zero.
So why hasn't vigorous hiring led to better paydays?
Three factors help explain the unusual trend:
UNEMPLOYMENT NEEDS TO GO EVEN LOWER
Monthly wage gains last meaningfully outpaced inflation from mid-2006 through 2007, just before the Great Recession started. The unemployment rate then ranged between 4.4 percent and 4.8 percent. If that pattern holds true, unemployment would have to drop another full percentage point from its current 5.9 percent before wages break out of their funk.
Economists note that wages are generally a ``lagging'' indicator. What they mean is that pay typically starts rising well after the job market has shown significant improvement. As the economy takes off, employers eventually need more workers to meet customer demand. Unless those companies boost pay, they often won't attract enough qualified candidates for the jobs they want to fill.
Some economists think we might be close to that point already but say we might not know until months after the fact.
``We may find out six months from now that 6 percent was the trigger point,'' said Maury Harris, an economist at the bank UBS.
 
YOUNGER WORKERS EARN LESS
As older, higher-paid baby boomers retire, they're being replaced by younger workers who earn less. That demographic shift limits how much average pay can grow.
Recent college graduates are earning $692 a week, according to a paper issued this year by the San Francisco Federal Reserve. That's just shy of $36,000 a year. It's also slightly less than the average wage for all non-management workers _ most of whom lack a college degree and the additional earnings power it carries.
Based on the jobs report, more young workers are flooding the job market and are willing to work for less, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.
Employers can reduce costs by hiring more 20-somethings who don't have families to support. Or, they can dangle the possibility of replacing their older workers with younger ones to limit pay hikes for their existing employees.
``It's much easier to lower an entry-level wage than a wage for an existing worker,'' Swonk said. ``It's also a bargaining chip that goes to employers over workers.''
A HANGOVER FROM THE RECESSION
After the most destructive economic slump since the 1930s, it can take years to heal.
In a speech in August, Fed Chair Janet Yellen floated an intriguing explanation for lackluster wage growth: Employers seldom cut wages during a recession, even though it might, in theory, make financial sense to do so.
The reason they don't is that wage cuts can break employee morale and possibly disrupt business. Since employers shouldered higher wages than they wanted to during the recession, they might be making up the difference by paying workers less during the recovery.
If true, this means wages may lag for a while longer. Yet once they do, they might ``increase at a more rapid clip,'' Bank of America suggested in an analysis Friday.
What's more, lots of people have given up looking for work after being laid off during the recession. The government can track this trend by measuring the percentage of adults who either have a job or are looking for one.
This rate will decline naturally as waves of baby boomers retire. But some economists say the rate fell more during the recession than demographic trends alone would indicate. The rate was 62.7 percent in September, down 3.3 percentage points from just before the recession. A single percentage point represents about 1.5 million potential workers.
Some of the unemployed gave up their job searches long ago. So the government no longer considers them part of the labor force. Still, many of them might still be open to accepting a job if the right one emerges. This means employers might in theory have a deeper supply of possible workers to choose from than the jobs report indicates.
The irony is that these long-term unemployed may be waiting to be offered higher pay. Yet the potential for pay growth is limited when so many people need work.
``The fact that wages remain stuck despite 48 successive months of job gains suggests that employers' bargaining power remains exceptionally strong,'' said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution.

Flavoured camel milk to hit retail stores soonFlavoured camel milk to hit retail stores soon; expert group working on setting guidelines

( It is(camel milk) rich…)
?By Sidhartha Singh
NEW DELHI: Flavoured camel milk , popular in Gulf countries as a health drink, may soon hit the shelves of grocery stores in India. An expert group set up by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is working on setting standards for selling camel milk as a food product for human consumption, the chairman of the authority told ET.
The move will not only pave the way for marketing of a product seen as beneficial in curing lifestyle diseases, but also help revive the declining fortunes of India's poor camel breeders who often sell their cow camels for slaughter.
The department of animal husbandry, dairying & fisheries has asked FSSAI to set standards for camel milk, K Chandramouli said. "We have passed it on to the expert group on milk and milk products, and they will make their recommendation."
While the Supreme Court in 2000 ruled that camel milk is fit for human consumption, the Milk and Milk Products Order still recognises milk from only cows, buffaloes, sheep, goats and mixture thereof. This thwarts efforts to market an estimated 1.5 lakh litres of camel milk that Rajasthan and Gujarat can collectively produce every day.
The country's largest dairy cooperative, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, has readied a plan to launch camel milk products and is awaiting the food regulator's rules. Camel milk, which desert nomads have been drinking for generations, is privately sold in Udaipur and Bhilwara districts of Rajasthan at very low rates. It is also popular among foreign tourists visiting the desert towns of the state.
According to studies, camel milk has three times more vitamin C and 10 times more iron than cow milk. It is rich in unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin B and is said to be almost as nutritious as human breast milk. Outside India, the milk is being marketed as a health food in the Gulf and several African countries. Last year, the EU gave approval for its import from the Emirates.
RS Sodhi, managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which markets its products under the Amul brand, said it can start processing 5,000 litres of camel milk at its Kutch project within six months of the standards being notified.
"Camel milk will be sold as a health food. It will cost at least 20% more than cow's milk," Sodhi said, adding that the product will be first launched in Ahmedabad and then in the rest of the state.
"We will initially source milk from camel breeders in Kutch and Bhuj, and from Rajasthan at a later stage. The project will give camel breeders better remuneration for the milk." The federation's camel milk project has received about Rs 1 crore as aid from the Gujarat government. "If the food standards and safety agency agrees on standards for camel milk, that is an important prerequisite, but just the very first step to gradually build a market for camel dairy products," said Ilse Kohler-Rollefson, projects coordinator at the League for Pastoral Peoples and Endogenous Livestock Development.
"In theory, Rajasthan could produce about 1 lakh litres of camel milk per day. If we count in the Gujarat camels, it would be about 1.5 lakh litres." Kohler-Rollefson, who is heading a project to revive the fortunes of Rajasthan's camel breeders, said the Lokhit Pashu Palak Sansthan (LPPS), the Indian partner of the League for Pastoral Peoples, developed and tried to market a range of camel milk products — fresh milk, pasteurised milk, ice cream and curd — in Jaisalmer district, but could not bring it up to scale as it requires significant investment in technology, infrastructure and organisational development, which the project lacked.
"Camel milk is shown to reduce blood sugar levels in diabetes patients," Kohler-Rollefson said. India has an estimated 65 million diabetic patients, primarily because people tend to consume more sugarrich foods and drinks. Kohler-Rollefson said government help and investments are essential if sale of camels for meat and trade across borders is to be prohibited in accordance with the Rajasthan Camel Bill, 2014.
"The bottom line is that the camel cannot be saved unless camel breeders have a decent income. Camel dairying is the only option. However, in order to get this going, investments by private entrepreneurs or donors is needed," Kohler-Rollefson said. LPPS has some regular customers in far-off cities, Kohler-Rollefson said.
"We do have facilities for icecream making on our campus in Sadri and can make it on demand for visitors, but we are not able to get it to more distance consumers." Meanwhile, LPPS is making camel milk soaps, which are very popular at fairs, such as at Pushkar and the Nature Bazaar in Delhi.

Cleanliness is GodlinessPrint

We live in schizophrenic times. Shortly after the Prime Minister tried to revive khadi on All India Radio, Doordarshan beamed some margdarshan — the RSS chief’s annual address to his flock, now elevated to the status of an address to the nation. A day earlier, the PM had inaugurated the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan with: “Gandhiji had two dreams, free India and clean India.” Pity the poor suckers who waste their lives writing fat tomes on Gandhian thought. They have no idea it’s just a one-liner.
On Gandhi Jayanti, Modi snatched the broom from the nerveless hands of Arvind Kejriwal, and then he made a clean sweep by inviting the citizenry to upload videos before and after cleanup drives in their localities on Mygov.in. The “during” videos were supplied by cable television, which was all over the place in the crucial hour of the launch. Stirring animations everywhere, too — India News had a human hand sweeping magically clean across the Swachh Bharat logo, just like in the detergent ads. Incidentally, if Swachh Bharat works and India cleans up its act, Dettol soap will shrivel and die. Or it will need a new TV ad which does not have to peddle the fear of dirt to sell the product.
But not everyone held the line. News Nation played both Narendra Modi’s show and their own event: a programme in a mall in which young people were asked what Gandhigiri meant to them (the choice of location was not meant to be ironical). The answers suggested that education is flagging — no one had heard of The Story of My Experiments with Truth, except a parent named Shabir Ahmed, I think — but at the same time, it was clear that in an increasingly unsafe age, the young have developed a healthy fear of violence.
Perhaps to assert its autonomy, Rajya Sabha TV did a guftagu with Anurag Kashyap in his hotel room while everyone else was covering Modi’s clean sweep. Shall we hear the distant thunder of heads rolling? Or maybe, on the contrary, it will be held up as a mirror to Doordarshan, which is autonomous, while RSTV is owned by Parliament. And there’s no stopping free enterprise — while Modi swept away, Samay spent a lot of time trying to sell a Hanuman Chalisa yantra on a free gold-plated chain. But India TV made up for everyone with the utterly breathless: “Modi has picked up garbage with his hands!”
Earlier in the week, in New York City, Rajdeep Sardesai had also encountered some garbage and talked some garbage himself, when he got into an unseemly tangle with Modi-bhakts outside Madison Square Garden (which Indians are familiarly calling MSG; used to mean the monosodium glutamate in Chinese food). The bhakts think he is a Modi-baiter, though he has taken some baiting himself. There was a notable incident in the Gujarat chief minister’s campaign bus, in which he had crouched at his feet, to be told that the Sardesai shop ran by selling the riots continued…

We used to be friendsExpress News Service | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:33 am
Cast your mind back to 2004. Manmohan Singh was sworn in as prime minister for the first time and Tony Blair was still wallowing in his special relationship with George W. Bush. In those primitive times, mobiles had buttons, the iPhone was just a twinkle in Steve Jobs’s eye and fingers were only appendages we used mostly to eat and gesticulate with. MySpace and Friendster were duking it out for social network supremacy, and much of the media was grappling with these newfangled virtual soapboxes called blogs — microblogs weren’t even on the radar. Into this technological stone age charged a brash new entrant that upended the social networking world with its “scraps” and “testimonials”. Orkut, launched in January that year — a scant few days before a 19-year-old Harvard undergrad came up with something called “thefacebook” — was, for many across the globe, the site of and portal to a more sustained and enriching internet experience than email or search.
In its heyday, Orkut was more popular than Facebook, especially in India and Brazil. But it wilted under competition from Mark Zuckerberg’s juggernaut, and the profusion of trolls and spambots on the site did nothing to enhance its appeal. When Google, which owns Orkut, abandoned its first foray into social networking for the snazzier, though more dully monikered, Google+ in 2011, it was only following the droves of users who fled Orkut, leaving it a ghost town. Now, as of last Tuesday, the late and only slightly lamented Orkut joins the Google graveyard of ill-fated services that is also home to Reader, Wave, Buzz and Listen.
If there’s a lesson to be learnt from Orkut’s demise, it is that the digital world is a harsh and unforgiving place where technologies constantly clash and perish. Innovation reigns supreme, and there is always a new, nimbler kid on the block itching to take a stuffier incumbent down, off its lofty pedestal. Just ask Yahoo.

Why supermarkets are in troubleBy Sarah Halzack October 3 Follow @sarahhalzack

For decades, the traditional supermarket reigned as the primary destination for our grocery shopping.  It began with A&P, the pioneering grocery company that began to put independent grocers out of business nearly 100 years ago as it fanned out across the country.  Today, major grocery chains still capture a huge share of our grocery dollars: Kroger, the nation’s largest chain, raked in $98.4 billion from its fleet of 2,640 stores last year. Safeway pulled in $36.1 billion; Publix, $28 billion.
And yet experts say the industry is in the early stages of a massive shake-up, with rivals coming from all sides to siphon away customers. Players such as Whole Foods Market and Fresh Market are wooing customers seeking natural, organic foods.  Wal-Mart and Target are using their huge store footprints to offer a vast assortment of items, and they are joining dollar stores in going after a price-conscious grocery shopper.  Still more competition is coming from drug stores and convenience stores.
Jones Lang LaSalle’s retail research team has compiled a report that illuminates just how different the grocery store landscape is bound to look in the not-so-distant future.
Using data from retail consultancy Willard Bishop, JLL projects how sales and store counts will change across a variety of store formats between 2013 and 2018.  As you can see from these two charts, it’s not looking good for traditional supermarkets:
(A small note to help you understand the charts: The “fresh format” category includes Whole Foods and other organic grocers; the “limited assortment” category includes small-footprint outlets such as Trader Joe’s and Aldi. The rest of the categories are self-explanatory.)
In these forecasts, traditional grocery stores distantly trail their rivals in two key measures of growth.
The fresh format stores, in particular, have aggressive expansion plans in the coming year, a strategy that reflects a heightened interest in healthy diets and sustainable food practices.
“Beyond fresh format stores, limited assortment and dollar stores are also seeing strong percentage increases in store openings, which underscores that consumers continue to seek out value since the recession,” Ahlburn said in an e-mail.
Trader Joe’s is the emblem of success in the limited assortment category: With its low prices and a tightly-edited collection of products, the store is pulling down $1,723 in sales per square foot,  compared to $552 per square foot at Publix or $496 at Kroger.
Amid the rise of more shopping options, the forecasters expect that traditional supermarkets will lose ground to nearly all other shopping formats:
These supermarkets have ultra-narrow profit margins, building their success with shoppers who come back frequently and regularly fill their cart to their brim.  And so Ahlburn says their chief challenge in this climate will be to stay profitable.
So what are the key fronts in the battle for your grocery dollars?
“The real growth for the grocery sector is coming in the urban space,” Greg Maloney, chief executive of JLL Retail, said in an e-mail.
Plenty of players are experimenting with stores that work well for city spaces: Wal-Mart has launched its smaller-footprint Neighborhood Markets, while Target is piloting a similar Target Express concept. Experiments in grocery delivery services from the likes of Amazon Fresh and Instacart have also so far centered on major urban areas.
With the arrival of these fresh competitors and consumers’ shifting shopping preferences, the traditional supermarkets have a major fight for survival ahead of them.

The September Jobs Report in Picturesreddit
Today’s  generally solid report shows that employers are back on track creating more  than 200,000 jobs a month after a dip in August (see chart).  Nevertheless, the economy has substantial room  for further expansion, allowing the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low to  spur higher employment without igniting unacceptable inflation.  Moreover, policymakers should not worry about  inflation even if wages begin to grow faster than they have so far in the  recovery.
The  litany of labor market indicators with further room for improvement — that is, “slack” — is well known.  At 5.9 percent, the  unemployment rate remains about a half point higher than the Fed’s and most  other analysts’ estimates of the lowest sustainable rate that we could  achieve.  Many people who want to work  and would be working if the labor market were stronger have stopped looking  until their job prospects improve, so they are not counted among the  unemployed.  Indeed, the labor force  shrank in September, contributing to the fall in unemployment.  In addition, many people working part-time  jobs would prefer full time work if it were available.
Under  these conditions, employers have faced little pressure to raise wages.  Moreover, a significant share of the wage  increases that they’ve provided has been offset by increases in workers’ productivity (output produced per hour worked).  Together, the modest wage increases and ongoing productivity gains have  kept increases in employers’ labor costs per unit of output very modest.  Consequently, employers have been able to  widen their profit margins significantly, even in the face of weak demand for  goods and services that limited their ability to raise prices.  Labor compensation has fallen as a share of  total income while the share going to profits has risen.
As  the jobs recovery continues and labor market “slack” shrinks, employers may  have to start providing larger wage increases to attract the workers they need.  But as long as those wage increases are  offset partly by productivity growth and partly by a return to more normal profit margins, inflation should not rise beyond what the Fed should be willing  to tolerate.
Strong  demand for goods and services is the cure for labor market slack and sluggish  wage growth.  To achieve that, the Fed must  not raise interest rates too quickly and lawmakers must eschew near-term budget  cuts that would stifle economic growth.
About  the September Jobs Report
Employers  reported solid payroll growth in September.  In the separate household survey, the unemployment rate fell to 5.9  percent, but some of the decline resulted from labor force attrition, not  employment growth.  Average hourly  earnings were essentially unchanged.
Private and government  payrolls combined rose by 248,000 jobs in September and the Bureau of Labor  Statistics revised job growth in the previous two months upward by a total of 69,000  jobs.  Private employers added 236,000 jobs in September, while overall government  employment rose by 12,000.  State government employment rose by 22,000,  while federal government fell by 2,000 and local government fell by 8,000, despite  a gain of 6,000 local education jobs. 
This is the 55th  straight month of private-sector job creation, with payrolls growing by 10.3 million  jobs (a pace of 188,000 jobs a month) since February 2010; total nonfarm  employment (private plus government jobs) has grown by 9.8 million jobs over  the same period, or 178,000 a month.  Total government jobs fell by 557,000  over this period, dominated by a loss of 322,000 local government jobs.
The job losses incurred  in the Great Recession have been erased.  There are now 1.6 million more jobs on private payrolls and 1.1 million  more jobs on total payrolls than at the start of the recession in December 2007.  Because the working-age population has grown since  then, however, the number of jobs remains well short of what is needed to  restore full employment.  Employers have expanded  their payrolls at a 237,000-a-month pace this year, and such growth must  continue to restore normal labor market conditions in a reasonable period of  time.
Average hourly earnings  on nonfarm payrolls fell by a penny in September to $24.53.  Over the last 12 months they have risen just 2.0  percent.  For production and  nonsupervisory workers, average hourly earnings remained $20.67, or 2.3 percent  higher than 12 months earlier.
The unemployment rate fell  to 5.9 percent in September, and 9.3 million people were unemployed.  The  unemployment rate was 5.1 percent for whites (0.7 percentage points higher than  at the start of the recession), 11.0 percent for African Americans (2.0 percentage  points higher than at the start of the recession), and 6.9 percent for  Hispanics or Latinos (0.6 percentage points higher than at the start of the  recession).
The recession drove  many people out of the labor force, and the ongoing lack of job opportunities has  kept many potential jobseekers on the sidelines and not counted in the official  unemployment rate.  This problem remained  evident in September.  The labor force  shrank by 97,000 people, as the increase in employment of 232,000 people fell  short of the decline in unemployment of 329,000 people.  (Data on the number of people with a job and  the number of jobs on employers’ payrolls come from separate surveys.)
As a result of the decline  in the labor force, the labor force participation rate (the share of the  population aged 16 and over in the labor force) edged down to 62.7 percent in September.  While the sharp decline in labor force participation  during the recovery has abated, September’s rate is the lowest since 1978.
The share of the  population with a job, which plummeted in the recession from 62.7 percent in December  2007 to levels last seen in the mid-1980s and has remained below 60 percent  since early 2009, was 59.0 percent in September.  It has been at that level for the last four  months. 
The Labor Department’s  most comprehensive alternative unemployment rate measure — which includes  people who want to work but are discouraged from looking (those marginally  attached to the labor force) and people working part time because they can’t  find full-time jobs — edged down to 11.8 percent in September.  That’s well  down from its all-time high of 17.2 percent in April 2010 (in data that go back  to 1994) but still 3.0 percentage points higher than at the start of the  recession.  By that measure, about 18½ million people are unemployed or  underemployed.
Long-term unemployment  remains a significant concern.  More than  three in ten (31.9 percent) of the 9.3 million people who are unemployed — 3.0 million  people — have been looking for work for 27 weeks or longer.  These  long-term unemployed represent 1.9 percent of the labor force.  Before  this recession, the previous highs for these statistics over the past six  decades were 26.0 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, in June 1983, early in  the recovery from the 1981-82 recession.  A year after peaking at 2.6 percent, however, the  long-term unemployment rate had dropped to 1.4 percent, well below the current  rate.

Obama is just as good as Reagan at cutting unemploymentMatt Phillips & Jason Karaian
October 3, 2014
When it comes to lowering the US unemployment rate, President Barack Obama has done just as well as the revered conservative icon Ronald Reagan.
During September, Obama’s 69th month in the White House, the broad US unemployment rate fell to 5.9%, the lowest of his administration. The country’s unemployment is down 4.1 percentage points from October 2009, when the jobless rate hit a peak of 10%.
The nastiest stint of joblessness seen in the US in the decades prior to the Great Recession was the recession of the early 1980s, brought on by the US Federal Reserve in order to tame runaway inflation. Much like Obama, President Ronald Reagan took office in the midst of the ugliness. Unemployment climbed steadily for his first two years in office, peaking in November 1982 at 10.8%. It then fell sharply to 6.7% in January 1986. So, again peak-to-trough, a 4.1-percentage-point decline during his first 69 months in office.

In fact, if you go from the beginning of their terms to their 69th month chronologically, Obama looks like he was far more successful at cutting joblessness. From the day he took office until September, unemployment fell 1.9 percentage points under Obama. It was down a scant 0.5 percentage points from the beginning of Reagan’s presidency to his 69th month. (But that’s more an indication that things were just a lot worse when Obama took office, whereas they deteriorated sharply after Reagan became president.)
Now, it goes without saying that there are plenty of people who would argue that neither Reagan nor Obama—nor any president—has much to do with short-term economic growth. Maybe so, but the fact is that presidents and political leaders get the credit and the blame for the state of the economy.
And what’s striking is how sharply different public perceptions of both leaders’ handling of the economy have been. Despite a steadily rising labor market, US sentiment on the economy has remained decidedly sour , and President Obama’s approval rating has fallen. Meanwhile, a turn in the economy in the 1980s helped supercharge Reagan’s approval rating by 1986,  a similar point in his presidency . Reagan remains closely identified with economic success.
Why? Who knows. Perhaps it was the fact that the surge and collapse in unemployment was much sharper and faster under Reagan. Maybe it’s that, under Reagan, unemployment continued to fall steadily during his final years in office. Unemployment hit 5.3% in 1988, so during his entire stint in Washington the unemployment rate fell 5.5 percentage points. Of course, Obama could yet witness a similar phenomenon.

But, I have a sneaking suspicion that it’s the persistent weakness of household income, a symptom of worsening income inequality in the US, that’s making many Americans dismiss the improving economic fundamentals.
For example, between the end of Reagan’s first term in office, 1981, and the end of 1986, US real median household incomes—the household income at the middle of the US income distribution—had risen 7.7%. Over the first five years of the Obama administration they’re down 4.1%. In fact, US median incomes are basically where they were in 1989 , not long after Reagan left office. In other words, the economy might be improving, but millions of Americans don’t feel it. And that’s one of the reasons the Democrats are likely to feel some pain of their own in the coming US mid-term elections .

American Apparel added to notorious listAmerican Apparel added to a notorious list

AP
American Apparel (APP) , the struggling clothing maker that ousted its CEO and founder this year, has been added to Standard & Poor’s list of the companies the most at risk of defaulting on their debt payments.
Both stock and bond investors pay close attention to this list of “Weakest Links.” It’s a Who’s Who of the companies with the lowest credit ratings that also have negative futures in S&P’s eyes. These stocks are, S&P finds, the most likely to default or run into serious trouble. S&P updated its list earlier this week.
Being added to the Weakest Links list not just a caution sign for bond investors, but for stock investors, too. When companies default or have difficultly making interest payments, they often resort to actions that seriously harm common-stock holders.
American Apparel investors have already endured significant pain. Shares are down 37% over the past year as the company’s losses continue to mount. American Apparel lost $106 million last year, up from a loss of $37 million in 2002.
The company has made changes. In addition to ousting its CEO Dov Charney, the company in July signed a deal with Standard General for $25 million in financial backing.
But apparently, that’s not enough to pull the company out of its serious woes, according to the action by S&P. American Apparel is one of eight companies added to the list in the latest report– and the only one that’s publicly traded. American Apparel trades on the American Stock Exchange. Here are all the companies S&P added to its Weakest Links in the Sept. 30 report:

Modi focus on khadi  specialkidsThe audio address was aired live by most private satellite news channels as well. ( Source: Express photo by Anil Sharma )

A day after launching the Swachh Bharat Mission, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his debut on public broadcaster All India Radio (AIR), and exhorted citizens to use at least one khadi product — even a handkerchief, towel or a bedsheet — so that the poorer sections of society can benefit.
“If you buy khadi clothes, the houses of the poor get illuminated… and these days, starting October 2, there’s a special discount available on khadi for almost a month, one can make use of that,” the PM said during his 15-minute “Man Ki Baat” programme that was aired by AIR and several private radio stations.
The audio address was aired live by most private satellite news channels as well. The PM said that he intended to make this a regular interaction, and was thinking of doing it once or twice a month, at 11 am on Sundays.
“Everybody should walk one step ahead… if you take one step forward, the country takes 1.25 crore steps forward,” Modi said, and asked all Indians to pledge on Vijayadashami to defeat evil and do something good.
“We need to recognize ourselves” and “recognize our inner strengths”, the PM said. He invoked Swami Vivekananda, and used anecdotes to drive home the point that recognising its strengths would put the country on the path to success.
“You know, our scientists have undertaken the Mars mission successfully at minimum expense. There is nothing lacking in our capabilities. We have only forgotten our strengths. We have forgotten ourselves, and become despondent,” he said.
The PM said he had received several suggestions — from making skill development a part of the school curriculum from Class 5 onward, to having special programmes for specially-abled children; and from installing more dustbins, to banning polythene bags, to making the process of registration of small scale industries easier. He invited the people to share with him their constructive ideas and inspirational incidents.
Specially-abled children were the “responsibility of not only their families but the entire society”, the PM said. They should be made a part of the journey of development, he said. He even recalled that as chief minister of Gujarat, he would attend a Khel Mahakumbh for specially-abled children.
The radio, Modi said, was a “simple medium” which reached far. “It will help me reach the houses of the poorest of the poor… My country’s strength lies in the hutments of the poor, it lies in the villages, in its mothers, sisters and youth, and its farmers. “I have faith in your strength, that is why I have faith in this country’s future,” he said.

Chicago  7 area counties agree to work to boost exportsCompetition gives way to cooperation as area governments agree to work to boost exports.
Chicago, area counties say they'll work together after decades of 'every town for itself.'
After decades of an "every-town-for-itself" approach to economic development, Chicago-area leaders will pool efforts to pump up the region's tepid export growth rate in a pilot project to be announced Monday.
The planned two-year collaboration among Chicago, Cook County and the six collar counties, while quite modest in scale, represents a sea change for the region, where local governments have a history of poaching each other's corporate citizens and competing for newcomers.
Until this endeavor, "there had been no meeting of … the political leadership, the economic development leadership and the business community leadership in the seven-county region, focused on economic development, ever before," said Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who brokered the cooperative arrangement that also includes DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.
2012 export values by metro area
Suspicions ran deep and it took four years of assuring her counterparts that "when I talk about economic development, I'm not talking about stealing jobs from your counties," she said. "It's hard to sustain economic growth if you're only circulating dollars within the region and not bringing in resources from outside."
Leaders of the export initiative point to an International Monetary Fund estimate that 83 percent of global economic growth from 2013 to 2018 will occur outside the United States.
Building exports is seen as critical for the area if it wants to crank up economic growth and remain competitive globally — but data show performance has been lackluster. While the 14-county tri-state area was the No. 4 exporter nationwide in 2013 and its post-recession export growth rate was a tad higher than the national average, 31 other metro areas saw exports grow at a faster pace during the period, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution. The Washington-based think tank is guiding the export initiative here and in other metro areas around the country.
"Metro Chicago is one of the largest exporters in the country, but in this increasingly competitive marketplace, they cannot take that position for granted," said Amy Liu, co-director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program. The region "needs to assemble and promote a distinctive suite of products and services that will stand out from the competition to global customers."
Among the possibilities: the region's strength in architecture, urban planning and consulting services, as well as its capabilities in machinery manufacturing, Liu said.
Exports fueled 54 percent of the nation's recovery from 2009 to 2012, according to Brookings.
JPMorgan Chase will provide $500,000 for the two-year Metro Chicago Exports initiative as part of its ongoing collaboration with Brookings on programs aimed in increasing the competitive edge of American cities. Contributions from other sources are anticipated within two to three months, bringing the expected budget to more than $1 million.
The money will be used to identify small and midsize companies that have export potential, and to assist their plans through mentoring, microgrants and referrals to existing sources of help within the business community and government agencies.
The premise is that the Boeings of the world already know how to export, while only 6 percent of the nation's small and midsize firms are exporting — meaning there is untapped potential, say officials at business development agency World Business Chicago, which represents the city in this effort.

Collar counties and Chicago may not have coordinated their efforts well, but they've been very successful in greatly increasing exports of the human kind, as more and more people get fed up and leave the area for better areas to live in.

CF Industries rates high among Illinois firms in  13..."Demand for nitrogen is expected to grow approximately 2 percent globally for the next several years," Swenson said. That equates to the need for about 20 new plants between now and 2018, he said.
CF Industries hasn't neglected its shareholders, either, he said.
Over a recent 18-month period, it bought back $3 billion in stock and paid $236 million in dividends.
Last year, CF Industries' stock lagged both the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the 30-member S&P 500 Materials Index. Its total return was 16 percent, compared with 32 percent for the wider market and 26 percent for its S&P peer group.
But year to date in 2014, CF Industries has outperformed both, with an 18 percent total return, compared with 9 percent for the overall market and 11 percent for its S&P peers.
Neither CF Industries nor Yara would comment on the merger talks beyond short statements issued Tuesday.

September has been quite the month of non-stop “Modiplomacy”. India’s chief pitchman knocked off the world’s three largest economies in an exquisitely choreographed sequence of moves that underscored his geopolitical grandmastery. Prime Minister Narendra Modi started with a visit to friendly territory: Japan. There, after a decidedly un-Japanese bear hug with soul brother, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he returned with commitments for investments not only in much-needed infrastructure but also for this curious thing called “smart cities”. Next, he turned to the much pricklier relationship with India’s largest trading partner by inviting the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to his very own backyard of Gujarat — on his very own birthday. He managed to collect even more promises for infrastructure investment, despite the tensions with the Chinese on the Ladakh border. How could anyone, even a toughie like Xi, not cut the birthday boy some slack? Of course, Modi held off announcing his “Make in India” push to take the manufacturing sector up from 15 per cent to 25 per cent until after Xi’s departure. Remember, Xi’s China would be the prime competitor as the world’s top incumbent manufacturer. The “Make in India” move was nicely timed, coming just before Modi’s departure for the US, where he was in full sales mode. The message was: do business with us and make stuff in our factories — and yes, we are working on fixing our shoddy infrastructure. Subtext: forget China, think India.
Modi has shown that he is a consummate geopolitical chess player and pitchman for India. But he missed a chance at demonstrating some imaginative international leadership.
It is no secret that India needs to do more in the manufacturing sector. However, as it invests in this area, it is critical that it does not overlook the opportunity to show the rest of the world that it can do so without further endangering the state of the world’s climate. A push towards greater manufacturing prowess also raises the spectre of accelerating greenhouse gas emissions. India is already third in the world, behind the US and China, in emissions. Of the three, India has the highest rate of increase in emissions — a rather dubious distinction. While still far from adequate, both the US and China have taken some positive steps. US President Barack Obama has issued directives to reduce emissions from power plants to 30 per cent below 2005 levels and China has invested heavy in renewable and nuclear energy. Sadly, India’s efforts are minuscule in comparison.
Moreover, India has succeeded in sending amply clear signals that it is not losing any sleep over its rather miserable record on climate change. Modi chose to skip the summit continued…

A sanitation sena for IndiaPrint
While nearly everyone knows that smoking, chewing tobacco and drinking alcohol are harmful to health, close to half of all respondents stated that open defecation is no worse for child health than latrine use. (Source: PTI)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set the ambitious goal of changing the daily practice of over 600 million people who defecate in the open. In reality, the challenge is even more daunting because even people who have a toilet often prefer to defecate in the open. Building toilets will not be enough. Ending open defecation will require a shift in mindsets, because without addressing the attitudes that shape people’s distaste for latrine use and preference for open defecation, the government will fail to achieve its goal.
The government has made sanitation a priority in important symbolic ways, and has stirred a level of enthusiasm never seen before. But the government’s rhetoric is missing one critical detail for ridding India of the scourge of open defecation: who will be responsible for putting sanitation plans into action and for enacting an essential shift in sanitation beliefs? What we need is a sanitation sena — an army of frontline workers, one in every village, responsible solely for motivating and sustaining latrine use by every individual of every household.
At the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics (Rice), we recently conducted a Sanitation Quality, Use, Access and Trends (Squat) survey, which interviewed over 3,000 households in rural north India about their sanitation beliefs and behaviour. It is clear that government programming on sanitation has not reached most Indian villages, where close to 90 per cent of India’s open defecation occurs.
Despite funds specifically set aside for “information, education and communication” (IEC), we found alarmingly low levels of awareness of the negative health impacts of open defecation, even though open defecation kills hundreds of thousands of babies each year and impedes the physical and cognitive development of those who survive. While nearly everyone knows that smoking, chewing tobacco and drinking alcohol are harmful to health, close to half of all respondents stated that open defecation is no worse for child health than latrine use. Messages about the detrimental impacts of tobacco or alcohol consumption have been successfully communicated. But even after over 15 years of a “Total Sanitation Campaign”, we sadly cannot say the same for open defecation.
Still, what we care about most directly is whether people are aware of the importance of the practice of latrine use. To eliminate open defecation, we will need to have an impact on the defecation practices of millions of individual people. Unfortunately, most people don’t recall ever hearing or seeing messages meant to motivate behaviour change. The government has spent more than Rs 1,000 crore on IEC for sanitation over the years, but only 31 per cent of respondents said that they had ever seen a poster, wall-painting, pamphlet, street play or film about using latrines.
So what does this mean? The sanitation world is largely continued…

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s maiden visit to the US in his present capacity has just come to a close. As widely reported, his performance at New York’s Madison Square Garden was nothing short of an extravaganza. Despite a few stray demonstrators outside, he managed to bring the crowd to its feet amidst dance, music and a dazzling array of lights. Subsequently, his visit to Washington, DC has also yielded a striking joint communiqué that is simply vaulting in its scope and ambition. It sweeps across a range of possible areas of cooperation, extending from the development of civilian nuclear power to global counterterrorism. It also reiterates the common interest of both states in having India as a member of a reformed UN Security Council.
These goals, while lofty, are laudable and even desirable. However, what remains unknown are the likely strategies that the two sides will need to realise even a fraction of this vast agenda. Past communiqués have also been known for emphasising common democratic values, have expressed a desire for expanding the band of cooperation and have highlighted the need to meet various global challenges.
Suggesting that this joint statement amounts to little more than empty rhetoric would be both churlish and shortsighted. It would be harsh because it is important for national leaders to spell out defining visions, even if their realisation proves hard. It would also be ill-considered to dismiss those sentiments because a number of the goals that have been outlined are indeed worthwhile and desirable.
To achieve the levels of cooperation that have been delineated will require adroit diplomacy on the part of both sides. At the outset, little will be accomplished if various constituencies, especially in India, continue to dwell inordinately on the past. It is well known that the US and India, apart from fleeting moments, were at odds during the Cold War. These memories continue to haunt many within India’s elite circles. These lingering doubts focus mostly on the reliability of the US, its long dalliance with Pakistan and its uneven relationship with China. Despite their continuing presence, it is nevertheless important to recognise that both states now occupy markedly different positions in the emerging global order. Consequently, the past is not necessarily the most reliable guide to the future. Instead, a clear-eyed assessment of the present global circumstances suggests that the two states may well not remain prisoners of the past.
What are some of these changed circumstances? Today, the US and India, not to mention the states of East and Southeast Asia, confront the reality of a rising and potentially aggressive China. The border incidents in Ladakh during President Xi Jinping’s recent visit were a stark reminder that despite continued…

When a body wrapped in white was seen by a girl, she asked almost silently, “Is it Papa?” Quietly, came the reply, “No, it is Mama. Papa will soon follow.”
This exchange illustrates the situation in Srinagar, devastated by the recent floods. I was closely monitoring the situation from day one (September 7), through the media and friends in Kashmir. The feedback was passed to various Central authorities, especially the NDRF.
Unfortunately, the state administration seemed to be comatose. The army, air force, NDRF and paramilitary forces did a splendid job, despite the odds. Civilians too helped each other. Most shrines were open to all, irrespective of religion.
As I could bear the tragedy no longer, I decided to visit Srinagar for firsthand information and a correct appraisal of the situation, so that requisite assistance could be arranged. I was shocked to see the situation on the ground. Only the gurdwara’s rescue teams and a few civilians could be seen struggling to rescue trapped victims and extricate bodies. The victims were cursing the state government and praising the young Sikh boys who were toiling untiringly to help others. A minuscule minority (about a half per cent of the total population of the Valley) took to the steering wheel to protect all those in need, cutting across the barriers of religion!
Shattered by my encounters, I went to the main gurdwara, where thousands had taken refuge. The holy Guru Granth Sahib had been shifted from the sanctum sanctorum to a smaller room to accommodate those who had trusted the Sikhs for shelter. For, as Sikh philosophy professes, “Service to mankind is service to God.” The SGPC organised langar. Local Sikhs set up a medical camp. A few doctors had arrived from Amritsar, too. Blankets, clothes, medicines, rice, etc were distributed. I felt a little better seeing all this. The system was functioning reasonably well. I only helped the gurdwara management streamline various tasks with a well-assigned chain of command and unambiguous responsibilities. A control room was set up to disseminate information and address problems.
I was benumbed by a Sikh senior citizen narrating how his family had suffered during Partition and how they had struggled to earn their livelihood. Once again, they were back to what they had suffered 67 years ago. He added that it was not the financial loss that pained him, but the fact that he had to spread his hands for rice and blankets. He was not able to reconcile himself to this incalculable humiliation (“zillat”, in his words).
We shall encounter many such instances of fractured self-esteem, psychological disorders, depression and even suicidal tendencies. These have to be dealt with the sensitivity they deserve. Experts should be roped in for counselling. I foresee numerous challenges immediately after the victims return to their destroyed, damaged or vulnerable continued…

3 women pass Marine endurance test  paving way for 1st female infantry gradBy Dan Lamothe October 3 Follow @danlamothe

Three female Marine Corps officers on Thursday passed the grueling combat endurance test that kicks off the service’s screening for infantry officers, paving the way for the first woman to potentially graduate from the program.
The test is conducted at Quantico, Va., and is designed to assess each individual’s ability to withstand exhausting physical conditions and make difficult decisions at the same time. Twenty-four female volunteers have attempted the Marine Corps’ Infantry Officer Course, but none have passed to date. One woman passed the initial endurance test in 2012, but was dropped from the course about a week later due to stress fractures in her foot.
The integration of women at the Infantry Officer Course is one of the high-profile parts of the Pentagon’s ongoing research into which new jobs women should be allowed to serve in while in combat units. The infantry officer course that began Thursday included 93 men and seven women, said Capt. Maureen Krebs, a Marine Corps spokeswoman. Sixty-seven men passed along with the three women, and will continue through training.
Two of the women who passed the combat endurance test Thursday are captains who volunteered, Marine officials said. The third is a female lieutenant who attempted the course in July and did not pass, but opted to try again. The Marine Corps will not release their identities, citing federal guidelines for conducting human research.
The women who passed Thursday did so after Marine Corps leaders decided in July to open the Infantry Officer Course to active-duty female officers who are “company-grade,” including not only new lieutenants, but seasoned ones and captains, too. Those who volunteer were required to meet a new requirement: Completion of the male version of the service’s annual Physical Fitness Test and the Combat Fitness Test with first-class scores.
If the women pass the infantry course, they still will not be allowed to join the infantry. The Infantry Officer Course was opened on an experimental basis, and the job itself remains closed to women, Marine officials said.
Critics of opening the all-male infantry say doing so would weaken it. They cite privacy issues, and raise questions about whether political correctness would pave the way for a relaxing of standard. They also bring up cultural issues about whether men and women can work together effectively in high-stress situations. Others say women, if given the chance, will prove they can serve with distinction in the infantry, and that integrating them could help alleviate long-term problems in the military like sexual assault
Other services also are grappling with how to expand the integration of women in the military. Army Ranger School, for example was opened on experimental basis for the first time to women this month. They have until Dec. 1 to volunteer, and will do so on a one-time basis only, Army Col. Linda Sheimo told reporters at a conference on Friday.

Five points to check before buying life insuranceChoosing insurance policy? Things to keep in mind
Simplus Information Services –  Tue 23 Sep, 2014 1:17 PM IST
  Article: When is the best time to take a life insurance policy?
Bankbazaar.com - Wed 6 Aug, 2014 5:24 PM IST
You never know what tomorrow shall bring. It is always better to be ready for any eventuality. This means getting insured. There are different kinds of insurances – car, medical, life, and so on. You can even get specific features of your body insured.
What we are talking about here is life insurance. Simply put, you start keeping aside small sums of money for a certain period or all your life. In return, the insurance company promises you a higher amount. This can be given either at the end of the period or in case of sudden demise of the policy-holder. Thus, an insurance policy helps secure finances for the future.
Before selecting an insurance policy, keep these factors in mind:
-          Income v/s expense: Once you buy an insurance policy, you have to keep paying the premiums without fail. Otherwise, you will face a penalty fee. For this reason, you can consider your insurance premiums as a fixed cost every month or year. So, make sure this fits your budget. Once you deduct the premium payment from your income, you should have enough left to meet your expenses and invest in other assets. Also take into account future commitments and expenses. You may have greater responsibilities in the future, and thus may have less money to spare.
-          Investment v/s safety-net: When you think of insurance, you think of death, illness, and other such events. An insurance policy may seem as a safety net, but there are many kinds of insurances available which promise a return on your money, like an investment. What’s more, these also help bring down your taxable income. However, the costs vary. Take this into consideration before choosing an insurance policy.
-          Dependents: A big question while buying a policy is – how much should you insure yourself for? The answer depends on the number of people who are financially dependent on you. The insurance amount increases with the number of dependents. This is because they are beneficiaries in case anything happens to you; they are the ones who receive the insured amount.
-          Age: Remember, the older you are, the costlier the insurance. This pushes up your premium payments. For this reason, it is better to start early. However, the tenure of the insurance also impacts your cost. The longer the tenure, the higher the costs.
-          Compare: This is probably one of the most important factors to keep in mind. Before zeroing in on one policy, compare – both the cost as well as the coverage. As boring as it may be, read the fine print. Your and your loved ones’ lives depend on it. Don’t settle for less than you are worth.

Alan Dershowitz on Israel and HamasBy Eugene Volokh October 3 Follow @volokhc
Noted Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz has a new book out, “ Terror Tunnels: The Case for Israel’s Just War Against Hamas ,” a collection of essays that forcefully defend Israel’s actions against Hamas, both from before the most recent fighting (Part I) and since (Part II). The book also includes a long debate (about 15 percent of the book) between Dershowitz and John Dugard, a sharp critic of Israel. Here’s an excerpt from Dershowitz’s conclusion to the book, which I think captures his argument well:
Even if the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas holds for a while, it will probably not last. The international community is doing everything in its power to assure that once Hamas regroups and rearms, it will once again attack Israel with better rockets, deeper tunnels and more effective use of human shields. Hamas will once again deploy its dead baby strategy — placing its rocket launchers and tunnel entrances in densely populated areas so that Israel will have to kill civilians in order to attack these military targets. It will reprise this strategy because it always works. It works because Hamas makes it easy for the media to show the dead civilians but difficult to show the rockets and tunnels behind and beneath these civilian human shields.
The result of this one-sided emotional display of dead bodies is outrage against Israel for causing so many civilians deaths and demands for international investigations and prosecutions of Israeli officials and soldiers. Israel wins the war on the ground, while Hamas wins the war of international public opinion. Hamas then regroups and rearms, while Israel suffers permanent reputational damage for doing what every democracy would do — and doing it with fewer civilian casualties. So why shouldn’t Hamas repeat its winning tactic over and over again?

Amid Ebola concerns  patient in isolation at Maryland hospital with flu-like symptomsBy Elahe Izadi , Susan Svrluga and Abby Ohlheiser October 3 Follow @ElaheIzadi Follow @SusanSvrluga Follow @abbyohlheiser
Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)
UPDATE: The District of Columbia Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday that they have ruled out Ebola for the patient at Howard University Hospital.
EARLIER STORY: Two Washington area hospitals said within hours of each other Friday that they had each admitted a patient with symptoms and travel histories associated with Ebola.
A person who had recently traveled to Nigeria came to Howard University Hospital in the District overnight "presenting symptoms that could be associated with Ebola," spokeswoman Kerry-Ann Hamilton said in a statement.
"In an abundance of caution, we have activated the appropriate infection control protocols, including isolating the patient," she said. "Our medical team continues to evaluate and monitor progress in close collaboration with the CDC and the Department of Health."
Just hours later, Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Md., north of Washington, confirmed that it was evaluating a patient who "presented with flu-like symptoms and a travel history that matches criteria for possible Ebola."
But on Friday night, Shady Grove Adventist officials said they had ruled out Ebola. "Our medical team has determined that the patient has malaria and does not have Ebola," the hospital said in a statement.
While Ebola continues to devastate West African nations including Liberia and Sierra Leone, the outbreak in Nigeria – where the Howard patient had traveled – may actually be coming to an end , with no new cases since Aug. 31, the CDC reported earlier this week. At one point, 894 people in Nigeria were being monitored since they had come into contact with someone sick with Ebola.

Overall, the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history has killed at least 3,439 people in West Africa and infected thousands more, according to the World Health Organization.
But before an Ebola case was confirmed in Dallas this week, there had not been a single Ebola diagnosis in the United States.
Potential Ebola patients who were evaluated in New York , California , New Mexico and Miami all tested negative for the virus.
[RELATED: How do you get Ebola? ]
People with Ebola are not contagious until they begin showing symptoms, which include a fever of greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, severe headache and vomiting. And you can only get Ebola through contact with a contagious person's bodily fluids.
Several Ebola patients have been transported from West Africa to the United States, including three Americans who were in Liberia — doctors Richard Sacra and Kent Brantly and missionary worker Nancy Writebol — who have already been discharged after they were successfully treated here. A Liberian American, Patrick Sawyer, fell ill after traveling to Nigeria and died of the disease.
The NIH in Bethesda recently admitted an American patient who had been exposed to Ebola.
On Thursday night, NBC News announced that a freelance cameraman working for the network in Liberia has tested positive for Ebola and will return to the United States for treatment.
In Maryland, all health providers and labs are required to report suspected Ebola cases to the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene immediately, said spokesman Christopher Garrett. The state agency works with local health departments to ensure that proper procedures, including isolation, are followed; information has been distributed to hospitals, nursing homes, labs and other providers.
Officials at several local hospitals said they have been following CDC guidelines. At the University of Virginia Health System, an emerging-infectious-diseases work group was formed earlier this year to respond to MERS; this summer, that group began preparedness planning for the possibility of Ebola infections.
The system has already been tested; the University of Virginia Health System has had one patient who met CDC criteria for Ebola screening, based on travel history, fever and other symptoms.
"We confirmed that concern with public health authorities and went through the formal process of admitting and evaluating that person for Ebola,” said Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology, infection prevention and control. “We ruled out the possibility of Ebola.”

RSS chief on DD: BJP lashes out at Congress  asks why did you block broadcast tillnowMohan Bhagwat
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: October 4, 2014 4:17 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 4:18 am
As the Congress and other opposition parties stepped up the attack on Doordarshan (DD) for broadcasting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Vijayadashami address, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar strongly backed the public broadcaster and asked the Congress why it had “imposed a blanket ban on telecast of RSS rallies for the past five decades”.
“I had no idea about the RSS rally’s live telecast. I learnt about it late Thursday night. The decision to show the live telecast… was taken by DD, which is an autonomous body. I had not issued any directives… But what is wrong with DD showing the RSS rally? There are several private channels which showed the live telecast because of its news value,” Javadekar said. “The big question that comes to my mind is, why did the Congress impose a blanket ban on telecast of RSS rallies for the past five decades? Why was it not shown to people?” he added.
Javadekar also rubbished suggestions that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked for the address to be telecast. “DD has every right to take decisions,” he said.
In a tweet after the telecast, Modi had said, “Mohan Bhagwat ji talked about important national issues in his speech. The issues of social reform that he raised are very relevant today.”
The RSS chief’s Vijayadashami speech has been webcast live in the past on the websites rss.org and vskbharat.com, and on the spiritual network Sadhna TV. This is the first time that DD covered it.
Attacking the state broadcaster, Congress spokesperson Sandeep Dikshit said, “It is a dangerous tradition. This is not an organisation which is completely neutral. It is a controversial organisation.”
Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi termed it “absolutely amazing, shocking, unbelievable and unprecedented” and an “unfortunate, gross, blatant misuse of official government largesse and machinery”.
Condemning the broadcast, the CPM said, “The RSS uses the occasion to propagate its Hindutva ideology.”
CPI national secretary D Raja said it was a “disquieting and distressing trend” that the country’s secular and democratic values were being undermined by the government.
Javadekar hit back at the criticism, saying, “What’s the whole controversy? Why are Congress and Left parties raising a hue and cry? Are the RSS criminals? Are they anti-nationals? Let any Congress or Samajwadi leader point out a single issue mentioned in the rally that goes against nationalism. The RSS always plays a role in nation-building.”
He also took a jibe at the Congress leadership, saying, “If DD could show poorly attended rallies of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for the past many years, what is wrong if an RSS rally is being shown? The telecast has received tremendous response across the country.”
Asked if RSS rallies would be live telecast in the future as well, he said, “I want to know why the UPA imposed a gag on RSS rallies… The self-certified secular parties like Congress owe an explanation to people for raking up a non-issue. Who are they to decide who continued…

After Days Of Protests  School Board Won t Back Off Proposal To Change History CurriculumColorado School Board Member Refuses To Withdraw Proposal To Review AP History Curriculum

GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) — Students, parents and teachers in suburban Denver vow to continue demonstrating against a school board's new conservative majority after it refused to back off plans to review Advanced Placement U.S. history courses for what some see as anti-American content.
The Jefferson County Board of Education voted Thursday night to lay the groundwork for a review of curriculum, with the AP history course likely the first to get a deeper look. Board member Julie Williams, who proposed the history review, said she wants to make sure the class is balanced.
The elective course has been criticized by the Republican National Committee and the Texas State Board of Education, which has told teachers not to teach according to the course's new framework. Being taught for the first time this year, it gives greater attention to the history of North America and its native people before colonization and their clashes with Europeans, but critics say it downplays the settlers' success in establishing a new nation.
The Colorado board didn't vote on its original proposal to review the history course with an eye toward promoting patriotism and downplaying social disorder — language students have blasted in school-time protests across the district. However, students and other activists say the board's new approach to include students on existing curriculum review committees doesn't satisfy them because they believe board members will ultimately try to change the history course to suit their views.
"This isn't over," said Ashlyn Maher, 18, a Chatfield High School senior who has been helping organize protests over the past two weeks. "We are going to fight until we see some results."
Students and parents — along with Jefferson County teachers who are in their own fight with the board over evaluations and merit pay — demonstrated along a busy boulevard during Friday's afternoon rush hour as passing cars honked their horns.
Toni Johnson Boschee held a sign calling for a recall against the conservative board members as she carried her youngest child on her back, a Starbucks cup in one hand and fliers in the other. She said she's frustrated that the board did not listen to or engage in conversation with those who turned out against the history proposal.
"This is tyranny in slow motion. This is how it happens. We all need to stand up and raise our voices," she said.
The College Board administers the course and other AP classes, which are meant to prepare students for college and give them a chance at earning college credit. It says the framework — an outline of the course built around themes like "politics and power" and "environment and geography" — isn't meant to be an exhaustive list of everything to be studied, and teachers are always free to add material required by their states.
For example, Martin Luther King Jr. isn't mentioned in the framework, but the Black Panthers are. The College Board's instructions about the new framework say teachers know to include King but asked for help with less obvious examples of people and events to discuss around some of the themes.
But besides who is mentioned and who isn't, veteran history teacher Larry Krieger, of Montgomery, New Jersey, faults the framework for having a global, revisionist view. He said it depicts the U.S. as going from conquering Native Americans to becoming an imperial power, while downplaying examples of cooperation and unity.
"Native Americans were defeated, wrongs were done, African-Americans were enslaved. However, at the same time this was going on, democratic institutions were being established, there was religious toleration and a new society was being created," he said.
The College Board says students need to be familiar with concepts taught in college classes but the exam for college credit will often give students a chance to demonstrate multiple points of view.
Joan Bertin, executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, which opposed the Colorado proposal, said it's likely the issue could come up before school boards elsewhere at a time when some are also upset about Common Core, a new set of educational standards for reading and math adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia.
"People who are not in any ideological camp are going to say: 'Wait a minute. We just want our kids to get a good education. We don't want them to be indoctrinated into anything,'" she said.

Taking a moment to unplug  focus on happiness0
We are all brands now, whether we like it or not, and our careers and working lives are narratives writ large on LinkedIn pages and in Twitter and Facebook feeds. The very connectivity that allows work flexibility -- email, Skype, instant messaging -- and personal branding can, I believe, cloud our perception of what we're actually doing with our lives.
So it's important that we step back, at least occasionally, and ask ourselves some difficult questions. That's what Joe does -- in an admittedly over-the-top fashion -- in Basu's novel.
In an email exchange -- I don't believe they have phones in Canada -- the author said the story is about the pursuit of happiness: "I think Joe needed to figure things out. To figure out his own story. Who he was."
I asked Basu a few other questions:
Q: A lot of working people don't give enough thought to what it is they're doing and whether it's what they're meant to do. A journey like Joe's is unrealistic, but do you think people can benefit from at least taking a mental journey, spending some time thinking about their place in the world and perhaps paying attention to "the man" in their heads?
A: I think everyone can use a "reset" every once in a while. In other countries, I believe this is called "a vacation."
Q: Did you ever hit a point in your career where you questioned the path you were on? If so, how did you resolve those thoughts?
A: I have. You have to push through it. And talk about it with people. While sipping some fine bourbon. Seriously, we're lucky to live in a time where you can choose your path. Hey, I believe happiness is more important than money. But I'm a dumb Canadian.
Q: Will you sponsor my cross-country journey of self discovery?
A: I will. But first let me round up some sponsors and get a TV deal. And a full media plan. And a content marketing team together. Hold on.
There's much to be learned from books about the workplace (and columns!), but I think we forget how much can come from the simple act of looking inward. Does my job line up with the things in life that make me happy? Are there small ways I can modify my career that might put me on a better track? Or is there a leap I need to take -- within practical boundaries -- that will get me where I'm meant to be?
This gets rather philosophical, I know, but that's what happens when you sit on a beach without any form of electronic distraction. You think about things. You relate a work of fiction to the reality around you and find there's value in letting your brain go briefly unwired.
It's an exercise we should all do more often, even if what we might learn scares us.
Joe says in the book: "Most people are happy being what we are and letting things happen ... But they stop to study their lives and realize, suddenly, it's not good enough. And then you need the courage to follow the path. And luck. We all need some luck."
Here's to courage, and luck, and to Basu for writing a book that should make any working American stop and think.

Companies can learn from the NFL s new domestic...4
"The biggest problems employers have is they Google 'handbook' on the Internet and then tailor it to what they need, but then there's no implementation or training," he said. "I personally think employers have a legal and moral obligation to make sure they have good people in the workplace and make sure those people are representing the company in the best light possible. They need to provide policies that address discipline and foster an environment in the workplace that assures victims that they have avenues to go to and that they should feel safe in approaching the people at work to obtain the help they need."
Kim Gandy, president and CEO of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said a very basic first step is to have a policy that says the company "won't discriminate against an employee based on his or her status as a victim, that you won't fire or demote someone because they're a victim."
"Many employers say, 'I just don't want this aggravation; I'm just going to fire this person,'" Gandy said. "That happens far more often than you would think it does."
A clear, concise statement can make a powerful difference. It shows that a company takes the issue of domestic abuse seriously and will protect its workers.
Gandy said it's also important to provide employees who are victims of domestic violence with the time off they need to make court appearances.
"We've had people who haven't made court appearances because they can't leave their jobs," she said. "They know that if they get fired, they might have to return to the domestic situations because they couldn't afford to take care of their kids."
Training of company leaders and human resources representatives is also key.
"Having an ombudsperson or just somebody in HR who is trained and understands the complexities of domestic violence and what that means," Gandy said. "And just talking about it. Putting up posters. Having a speaker come in, doing employee education. Taking a position as an organization. Something as simple as the company making a donation to the local shelter."
She continued: "Domestic violence is still really kept under wraps. People don't want to talk about it. If I tell people I've been hit, they'll think something's wrong with me; they'll think I must be stupid for letting someone do that to me. You wouldn't think there's shame involved, but there is. So just talking about it and keeping it out in the open, saying this happens, we don't want it to happen here, but if it does, we want to know about it, and we want to help you."
That's where I hope the NFL's policy change can at least open up a dialogue in workplaces across the country. Having a disciplinary policy to handle a person convicted of domestic violence or sexual assault is not enough, by any stretch. Companies need to acknowledge the prevalence of domestic abuse and be far more proactive in helping those who suffer at the hands of abusers.
"It's good business," Gandy said. "Any employer who looks around the room and thinks, 'Hmm, 1 in 4 women in this room will be affected by domestic violence, so if I take a position on this issue and I'm public about it and I do it positively, that's going to raise the company and the esteem of its employees.'"
Of course, she — and I — would prefer to see companies make these decisions because it's the right thing to do morally. But at the end of the day, regardless of the motivation, what matters is that it gets done.
Follow the NFL's lead on this one. It's overdue. It's important. And it matters.

Why you need a vacationAs information floods in — news, Facebook posts, tweets, YouTube videos, text messages, conversations — your brain juggles and juggles ... and sometimes loses something. What'shername in the elevator. Where you put the iPad. The brilliant sentence that goes here.
A vacation hits the brain reset button.
Unfortunately, too many Americans — about 1 in 5, according to a recent Monster.com poll — say they "never fully relax" on vacation. Hmm. A few questions: Did you turn off your cellphone, laptop and Google glass? Did you issue a dire warning to office mates not to call unless the collapse of the empire was imminent? Did you build in some time to let your mind wander (see No. 2 above), serene in the scientific fact that this could be the best way to prime the creativity pump for when you return to work. Did you, in other words, just shut down and ... exhale?
We all know misguided humans who believe that the electronic tether cannot be severed, that the world cannot possibly survive without their instant and constant input. These are people who are not using 100 percent of their brains.
Some people dwell in a constant state of dread that — ack! — they could be bored for a few milliseconds. Boredom is not fatal. It is vital. It can boost imagination and creativity. It can lead to new hobbies and interests. Or it can lead to a realization that you really do like a busy, calendar-choked life.
Encouraging news: America's "vacation deficit" is declining. More Americans — just over half of those polled — say they intend to take a vacation in 2014, reports Ipsos Public Affairs. That's up 5 percentage points over last year.
So let your neurons roam free this summer. Take a break. The challenge: Try hard to use less than 10 percent of your brain.

Forget Tinder. If you really want to get a date, move to one of the top metro areas where the odds are most in your favor.
Pew Research published an interactive map this week that shows the areas of the country with the highest ratios of single men to single women. It was a follow-up to a poll Pew published last week that found a record number of Americans 25 and older have never been married: 20%.
But more than half of those singletons want to get married. And among women, 78% said that it was "very important" that their spouse have a steady job.
Out of large metro areas, San Jose, Calif., is the best bet for young professionals. The area has a ratio of 114 employed single young men to 100 single young women, Pew finds.
· Denver comes in second with a ratio of 101 working young single men to 100 single women.
· San Diego is third with 99 working, single young men to 100 single, young women.
The rankings are based on 43 metro areas with more than 100,000 unmarried adults between the ages of 25 and 34.
The worst place to go if you're a single woman looking for a working single man is Memphis. The ratio of employed, single men 25-34 to single women is 59 to 100.
You can also search the map by the ratio of men to women, and women to men overall, not just those with a steady paycheck.

Facebook steps up battle on  fake likesFacebook steps up battle on 'fake likes'
By AFP | 4 Oct, 2014, 03.57AM IST
Facebook said Friday it has stepped up its battle against spammers who promise to deliver "likes" to its members, and warned users on using such scams
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook said Friday it has stepped up its battle against spammers who promise to deliver "likes" to its members, and warned users on using such scams.
The world's most popular social network said that to date, it has obtained legal judgments of nearly $2 billion against fraudulent activities on Facebook. It was not clear how much of that was actually collected.
Facebook's moves appeared to counter concerns that users -- including politicians and companies selling products -- are buying "likes" to make them appear more popular. And it is targeting a cottage industry which seeks to deliver these results to Facebook members, often promising "10,000 likes" or more for a fee.
"We write rules and use machine learning to catch suspicious behavior that sticks out. When we catch fraudulent activity, we work to counter and prevent it, including blocking accounts and removing fake likes all at once," Facebook site integrity engineer Matt Jones said in a blog post.
"As our tools have become more sophisticated, we've contributed some of our spam-fighting technology to the academic community as well, in hopes of helping other companies combat similar problems."
Jones said that Facebook if necessary takes the spammers to court "to remind would-be offenders that we will fight back to prevent abuse on our platform. We also limit likes per account to make spammers' operations less efficient."
Jones said the moves are aimed at preserving authenticity on the network of more than one billion members. Facebook uses various techniques including algorithms to detect when there is a suspicious spike in "likes."
"It's important to remember that fraudulent activity is bad for everyone -- including page owners, advertisers, Facebook and people on our platform," he said.
"We have a strong incentive to aggressively go after the bad actors behind fake likes because businesses and people who use our platform want real connections and results, not fakes."

Why Ben Bernanke cant refinance his mortgageWhy former Fed chief Ben Bernanke can’t refinance his mortgage
New York Times Oct 4, 2014, 03.11AM IST

("The biggest issue that…)
By Neil Irwin
An employee of a think tank owns a house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington. He wants to refinance his mortgage, but the bank won't give him a loan. It is perhaps not the most shocking story in the world, but it becomes so when you learn that the think tank employee is Ben S Bernanke, who was until earlier this year the chairman of the Federal Reserve, charged with setting the course of interest rate policy for the US economy.
And it seems downright absurd when you consider that he now makes a reported $250,000 for giving a speech and has signed a book contract that is surely in the seven figures. His income this next couple of years will surely dwarf the value of his house (he and his wife bought it for $839,000 in 2004, and it is currently assessed at $815,000, according to District of Columbia property records).
"Just between us," he said on stage at a conference in Chicago on Thursday, according to Bloomberg News, "I recently tried to refinance my mortgage and I was unsuccessful in doing so."
So what's going on? The problem probably boils down to this: Anybody who knows how the world works may know that Ben Bernanke has vast earning potential, and that he is as safe a credit risk as one could imagine. But he just changed jobs a few months ago. And in the thoroughly automated world of mortgage finance, having recently changed jobs makes you a steeper credit risk.
"The biggest issue that we see with changes in employment is when a change in pay structure occurs," said Jim Woodworth, a mortgage specialist at Quicken Loans, in an article on that company's site offering home-buying advice.
"For example, someone that goes from a salaried position to a commissioned position will encounter some obstacles with applying for a loan, even if the new job results in higher income."
That would seem to fit Bernanke to a tee. He recently ended 11 years of steady employment with the federal government, during which he earned a steady salary. Now, while his earning potential is vast, it is irregular, with an unpredictable stream of revenue from speeches and book advance payments. At the event in Chicago, Bernanke was using his own refinancing difficulties to make a point that mortgage credit may still be tighter than it should be.
But rather than a simple matter of tight versus loose, the real dynamic in the mortgage market right now may be one of a lack of flexibility. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage companies, now dominate the market for loans, so banks must meet their strict standards for any loans they wish to sell off to them at favorable interest rates.
Meanwhile, banks themselves are under pressure from regulators not to take major risks on their balance sheets. More broadly, the old-school model of what it means to apply for a mortgage - go down to your local bank and have a loan officer meet with you and try to judge whether you are likely to repay the mortgage - is very much a thing of the past.
The more automated mortgages have become - based on formulas tied to credit scores and employment histories - the less room individual lenders have to use sensible judgment to conclude that, just maybe, the nice man with a beard who looks vaguely familiar and seems quite certain he will make plenty of money to make his mortgage payments might be a good credit risk, no matter what his employment history says.

Officials in a fix after withdrawal of notification regarding the constitution of the Planning Commission
Yogima Sharma, ET Bureau Oct 4, 2014, 11.03AM IST

Manmohan Singh
(The dismal state of affairs…)
NEW DELHI: Careers of several senior bureaucrats of the Planning Commission have been in limbo since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address, sounded the death knell for the 64-year old institution that formulated five-year plans and influenced policy decisions during its heyday.
The promotion of a joint advisor, who has had a record of outstanding performance throughout his career, has got stuck at the highest level while another senior officer, who has put in 10 years in the commission, has been waiting for her cadre to place her out. "My promotion within the commission was cleared by the top brass here but got stuck at the Cabinet level because the government has decided to wind up the institution itself. This is despite an outstanding performance each year in more than two decades of service," the joint advisor told ET on condition of anonymity.
The dismal state of affairs is evident in the corridors of Yojana Bhawan, headquarters of the commission, where officers have neither much work nor any growth prospects in sight. "I have been requesting my cadre to take me out of the commission, but they are waiting to see what the new government does with the several economic service officers working here," said an advisor in the commission.
The Cabinet declared last month that the notification regarding the constitution of the Planning Commission stands withdrawn. There are at least 200 officers, at the rank of advisors, joint advisors and directors, in the commission out of the total staff strength of nearly 1,000. "No ministry officials are now seeking our views on the draft Cabinet notes. It is only the final Cabinet note that comes to us, that too very rarely, leave alone our views on policy matters," another advisor in the commission said.According to several officers, the most disappointing thing is that even the planning secretary Sindhushree Khullar has not even once, directly or indirectly conveyed to them that she will stand by her team to ensure that all members are well placed.
"She is in the Prime Minister's Office several times a day, almost every day, but not even once has she communicated with us on what lies ahead for us," said an officer, requesting not to be named. The PMO has roped in Khullar to resolve interministerial issues of infrastructure and sanitation. She has presented all infrastructure reviews in the past four months and played a key role in the roll-out of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on Thursday.
Khullar did not respond to an email query sent by ET.NC Saxena, a former secretary of the Planning Commission said that the officers, being government employees, need not worry for their salaries even if they did not have much work in the interim period. "However, since the new institution is likely to be thinner, they will either have to go back to their cadres or get absorbed in other ministries," he said.
Although the government has sought suggestions of experts and public as well as the erstwhile commission through a Cabinet note, it is yet to firm up its view on the new institution that will replace the commission. Arun Maira, member in the previous commission said that the government ought to act fast or else it might have to backtrack on the idea.
"The government needs to quickly define the structure of the new institution and figure out how much of its manpower requirement could be fulfilled by the existing officials," he said. "The inertia in the existing system is so strong that if you delay the process for long there is a possibility that the government will have to reverse its decision or we may end up getting a diluted version of the institution envisaged by them," Maira added, citing the example of the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO). The IEO was set up through a Cabinet order after the approval of the National Development Council.
However, the Modi-led NDA government, which took charge in May, closed down the IEO and decided to strengthen the Programme Evaluation Organisation, which has existed since 1952. The Planning Commission played a key role, most recently during the tenure of the previous UPA government, largely because of the closeness between its then deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and then PM Manmohan Singh.
 
The institution, which determined allocation of planned funds to states, influenced policy decisions especially with regard to infrastructure sectors. This resulted in a lot of discontent among various ministries that often criticised the commission for its overarching role. Ahluwalia could not be reached for comment.

Captive plants seek preference in re-auction...allottees
(Industries with captive…)
NEW DELHI: Industries with captive power plants want the government to give preference to operational units when re-auctioning of cancelled blocks starts next year. Last week the Supreme Court scrapped 214 coal blocks saying the allocations by the government over the last two decades were illegal. It ordered that the blocks be returned to Coal India.
For the past five to eight years, an aggregate 50,000 Mw of power plants installed by firms in sectors such as steel, aluminium, paper, cement, chemicals and textiles for captive use have been facing challenges in procuring coal. These industries are hopeful that when re-allocation of coal blocks starts, the government will give them preference.
In 2013, Coal India had reduced allocation to captive power projects while renewing its fuel supply agreements. The move pushed up fuel costs for these projects as they were forced to procure coal through auctions or rely more on imports. The Indian Captive Power Producers Association (ICPPA) said it sees the court verdict as backing for its demand that captive power projects be treated on a par with independent power projects for allocation of coal or coal blocks.
Last week, in a representation to power ministry officials, the association pointed out that the government's 'Make in India' drive will benefit if they can get reliable power supply at an affordable price.
Having their own coal mine would ensure regular fuel supply at predictable cost and allow them to produce cheaper electricity in the absence of middle men. "The judgement is a great lesson for all policy implementing agencies. Many of the block-linked enduse plants were futuristic and, hence, first preference should be given to existing industries to avoid speculative holding of coal blocks while re-allocating blocks," ICPPA secretary Rajiv Agrawal told ET.
The association claims that reduced coal supplies have made sizeable captive generation capacity idle, which is resulting in losses. Agrawal said that losing coal blocks is painful for investors and it may have wide ramification for companies and financial institutions that invested in them.
"We hope that proper valuations of operating blocks and infrastructure will be done to lessen these pains. Similarly, some method should be devised so that the investment of time, money and resources to seek permissions of nonproducing blocks are transferred to new allottees ," Agrawal said.

Wall St Ahead: Want to get back into stocks Check junk spreadsA positive vibe returned to the US stock market Friday, leaving some to wonder if, after two weeks of losses, the latest selloff scare was over
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: A positive vibe returned to the US stock market Friday, leaving some to wonder if, after two weeks of losses, the latest selloff scare was over. The best clues may come from what happens to low-quality corporate bonds.
The most recent decline in the S&P 500 marks the third time in six months that the market has looked wobbly and threatened a significant reversal. Each time, so far, it has bounced back quickly.
But what has some investors most worried this time around is the recent, notable underperformance in junk bonds in the past few months. In the past this has been a precursor to bearishness in the equity market.
High-yield corporate bond spreads, the premium investors get for purchasing low quality corporate debt as opposed to benchmark US Treasuries, have been increasing steadily since late June. A widening spread means their performance is lagging higher-quality bonds.
The spread has since widened by more than 100 basis points, according to Bank of America-Merrill Lynch data. Previous spikes of this magnitude have preceded pullbacks in the S&P 500, and the greater the selloff in high-yield debt, the worse the outcome was for stocks.
"Spreads are widening and it's certainly not a good time for equities. It doesn't have to be a terrible time, but it's telling you people are on the margin taking risk off," said Paul Zemsky , chief investment officer of Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.
He said that while reduced liquidity in the high-yield bond market could exaggerate the moves in spreads, the overall signal is of a marked shift in sentiment.
"I do think (the spread) has some information in terms of risk appetite and how people see economic growth," Zemsky said.
High yield most recently started widening against Treasuries beginning on June 23, when the S&P 500 was around 1,960, with the peak set earlier this week at an increase of 116 basis points. The S&P closed the week at 1,967.90 while the yield spread tightened slightly to 107 basis points.
The last time such a shift in spreads started was in May 2013, and it preceded a near 6 percent fall in the S&P. Weakening in junk bonds in early 2012 also preceded an S&P downdraft between April and June 2012, when the S&P last flirted with a 10 percent drop.
However, the move may not yet signal a market correction. As has been the pattern in 2014, investors are content to move money between different stock market sectors rather than flee altogether. Small-cap shares entered a correction at one point this week and the S&P energy sector fell 13 percent from their 2014 peak, but investors piled into the healthcare sector , which hit a lifetime record early last week.
In April 2011, high yield spreads began widening in a move that eventually reached 450 basis points. Stocks didn't begin to correct until the spread had moved nearly 100 basis points, but eventually they sank nearly 20 percent.
"If you run a chart of junk spreads going back five years this move is tiny. We've seen much, much bigger moves in junk, and much bigger selloffs in junk in the last five years," said Brian Reynolds , chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.
The current spike, he said, "did predict (the move) in stocks, it did follow through and we're probably now reaching a climax of panic," he said.
This is why the next move in credit spreads becomes key. Next week is relatively light for economic data. Investors haven't run entirely from bond markets, but have shifted funds around. High yield funds saw an outflow of $2.3 billion in the most recent week to Oct. 1, the most since early August, according to Lipper, as they moved money into high-grade corporate debt.
The focus may shift again to escalating conflicts in the Middle East, the stubborn weakness of the European economy, or the outcome of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests that are challenging the authority of Beijing.
For Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, the key lies in earnings reports, which begin in two weeks.
"If we don't get earnings corroborating the (bearish) story being told by spreads, then I think we'll see the spreads come in."

Chinese lenders gradually increasing India exposureChinese lenders like ICBC, CDB gradually increasing India exposure
Anita Bhoir, ET Bureau Oct 4, 2014, 10.58AM IST

CDB
(Industrial and Commercial…)
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's net profit from India has more than doubled in two years through March 2014, albeit on a small base. The profit and assets of the world's largest bank in India are still tiny compared with the local majors, but the pace of the expansion highlights the increasing presence of Chinese banks here as they try to play a larger role in supporting Chinese business interests while also diversifying their own asset base.
For China, which has $3.2 trillion of foreign exchange reserves and wants to deploy that beyond US treasuries, lending to some of India's fund-starved sectors offers double benefits - returns will be higher, and since these funds are for buying Chinese machinery, it will also boost its own manufacturing sector. For Indian corporates, especially in infrastructure, cheap Chinese funds provide a lifeline at a time when local banks are reluctant to expand their already large exposure to the sector.
These banks led by ICBC are expanding globally, with China's increasing financial and political clout. ICBC chairman Jiang Jianqing's has expressed his intent to tripling the contribution of overseas earnings to 10% by 2016. It recently acquired a 60% stake in Johannesburg-based Standard Bank for about $765 million. The deal also gives it an option to acquire another 20% over a five-year period.
"The Chinese are sitting on huge reserves and they are looking at investing outside the country," said Ashvin Parekh, managing partner of Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services. In India, the focus of Chinese financiers has been infrastructure, a sector that heavily depends on the neighbouring country for cheap equipment. For ICBC, the leveraged balance ance sheets of companies or an economic slowdown that has just started showing signs of ebbing had not been hindrance to increasing its India presence. Its profit has risen to Rs 231.15 crore at the end of March 2014 from Rs 99.95 crore in March 2012.
The bank set up operations in the country in May 2011 and over three years, its assets have grown by nearly 75% to Rs 907.64 crore. All this at a time when large foreign banks in the country, such as Standard Chartered, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Deutsche Bank, were facing pressure on their profitability. ICBC didn't respond to a request for comment.
The bank has so far only one branch in India and its loan portfolio consists of corporate loans for long-term projects in infrastructure, including power. During his recent India visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping had referred to ICBC's participation in funding India's infrastructure requirement.
"They have a long-term strategy in sight. They identify sectors which can assists the China story, for instance power," said Parekh. "Apart from debt exposure, in future I can see them taking equity exposures in the country." India's power sector is a big buyer of Chinese equipment, and so is the local telecom industry. And, Anil Ambani-led Reliance Power and Reliance Communication were the first to tap cheap Chinese funds. In 2011, RCom took a Rs 6,000-crore ($1.33 billion at the time) loan from China Development Bank to finance purchase of electrical equipment from China.
 
The telecom company followed it up with a Rs 2,700 crore loan agreement with China Development Bank (CDB), for financing imports and domestic expenditure of telecom equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE. In 2012, Chinese state banks including ICBC, CDB and Export Import Bank of China lent around $1.18 billion to refinance RCom's foreign currency convertible bonds.
In the same year, Lanco Infratech, another Indian infrastructure company, entered into an agreement with CDB for $2 billion of debt for two power projects totaling 2,640 mw. Of the total, $600 million was contributed by CDB and the rest was syndicated from other Chinese banks and financial institutions. China is India's largest trading partner, with Sino-Indian trade totaling $65.86 billion in 2013-14, and at $22.41 billion in the first fiscal quarter through June 2014, according to a report by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
India and China are targeting $100 billion of annual bilateral trade. The trade is heavily tilted towards China, and the huge trade deficit that India has with the neighbour is unlikely to narrow much in the near future. This means China's exports to India are set to increase substantially and so is the exposure of Chinese banks to the Indian economy. Recent agreements also indicate the possibility of that. Beijing and New Delhi signed deals worth $3.43 billion during President Xi's India visit last month.

Sweden to recognise Palestinian state  US ur...Sweden to recognise Palestinian state, US urges caution
By AFP | 4 Oct, 2014, 03.41AM IST
Sweden's new prime minister announced Friday that the country will recognise a Palestinian state, becoming the first EU member in Western Europe to do so
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
STOCKHOLM; Sweden's new prime minister announced Friday that the country will recognise a Palestinian state, becoming the first EU member in Western Europe to do so.
Social Democrat leader Stefan Loefven -- who won last month's general election -- said the Nordic country wanted to bolster a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Washington reacted quickly calling Stockholm's recognition "premature", while Palestinians cheered the decision as "courageous" and urged the rest of the European Union to follow suit.
"A two-state solution requires mutual recognition and the will to co-exist peacefully," Loefven said in his inaugural address to parliament.
This should take place with respect for the "legitimate demands of the Palestinians and the Israelis as regards their right to self-determination and security", he added.
Seven EU members in eastern European and the Mediterranean have already recognised a Palestinian state, namely Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Romania. Non-EU member Iceland is the only other western European nation to have done so.
But the United States cautioned against Sweden joining them. "We believe international recognition of a Palestinian state is premature," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.
"We certainly support Palestinian statehood, but it can only come through a negotiated outcome, a resolution of final status issues and mutual recognitions by both parties."
Israelis and the Palestinians, Psaki said, must be the ones "to agree on the terms on how they live in the future two states, living side-by-side."
Sweden's new foreign minister Margot Wallstroem told public broadcaster SR that Sweden was "in good company since 130 countries in the world have already done the same".
At least 112 countries have recognised a Palestinian state, according to an AFP count, although a Palestinian estimate puts the number at 134.
Wallstroem said that a recognition would be "an important signal facilitating... a two-state solution".
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said the rest of the EU should follow Sweden's example.
"We hope that all countries of the European Union will take the same courageous and remarkable decision... as there is no reason not to recognise the Palestinian state," he said in the West Bank capital of Ramallah.
Loefven's Social Democratic-Green Party coalition -- which formed a minority government on Friday -- is more supportive of demands for a Palestinian state than Sweden's previous centre-right administration.
The Social Democrats, the largest party in the Swedish parliament, wrote in their election manifesto that "Israel's war crimes must be investigated and the occupation of Gaza lifted".
The party added that "Sweden and the rest of the world must actively support its (Palestine's) work towards reconciliation".
The prime minister did not specify whether the policy would be put to a vote in parliament.
Sweden's foreign ministry declined to comment when asked by AFP if parliamentary approval was necessary.
The Palestinian envoy to Sweden, Hala Husni Fariz, said in a statement that the decision "reflects the historical support of the Swedish government for freedom, dignity and human rights".
Sweden voted in favour of Palestinian observer status at the United Nations in 2012, which was granted despite opposition from the United States and other countries.
The Swedish announcement coincided with the start of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, the "Day of Atonement", and an Israeli government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

Its positive for Ebola. Dreaded words triggeredBy Amy Ellis Nutt October 3 Follow amyellisnutt
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. (Mike Stone/Reuters)
The emergency operations office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta was very quiet. It was late in the afternoon on Tuesday, and a dozen or more CDC staff had gathered to hear the latest news out of Dallas about the suspected Ebola patient, Thomas Eric Duncan.
David Kuhar, an infection control medical officer at the CDC, was listening in.
He knew he might be flying out sooner rather than later, which is why he drove to work that day instead of riding his bike, as he usually did. On the conference call were local and state health officials from Texas.
And they had news about Duncan’s lab results:
“It’s positive for Ebola.”
Those were the words everyone at the CDC dreaded, but in truth expected.
The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, confirmed on Tuesday the diagnoses of the first case of Ebola in the United States. (AP)
And with that, some of the world’s premiere health investigators took off, with Kuhar, a specialist in contagious infections, in the lead.
He was an expert in Ebola and had been to Africa and was called in for the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula. That dangerous infection has now spread globally, including to the United States.
Ebola in the United States was always a possibility -- perhaps an inevitable one, the CDC team knew. Now they had their own patient zero.
A hazardous-materials crew arrived Friday at a Texas apartment where the U.S. Ebola patient Thomas Duncan stayed to collect bed sheets and towels used by him before he was hospitalized. (AP)
Before the conference call ended, Kuhar was already headed out the door. Within minutes, the CDC had made his travel arrangements. Booked on the 9:50 flight to Dallas, he dashed home to pack. An hour later, he was parking his 2002 Honda Accord in the economy lot (he knew he wasn’t coming home anytime soon) and hoofed it to the main terminal.
At least seven of the eventual 10 members of the team made the flight. (The number of CDC staff in Dallas will fluctuate over the coming days and weeks, Kuhar said, but the group includes senior epidemiologists, epidemic intelligence officers, doctors and nurses.)
Everyone on the team dropped what they were doing. One member based in Houston immediately got in his car and drove to Dallas. Communications coordinator, Dave Daigle, quickly cancelled vacation plans with his wife and his plans to visit his mother in Florida.
By the time the team arrived at the Courtyard Marriott on the North Central Expressway in Dallas, it was past midnight.
Less than 24 hours after the Ebola confirmation, the team was in place, just a mile from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The Marriott would be their unofficial headquarters for the time being.
The family that hosted Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan could be confined for three weeks. Health officials are reaching out to as many as 100 people who may have had contact with Duncan or someone who knows him. (AP)
Kuhar was up at 6:30 the next morning, Oct. 1, a Wednesday. The team met briefly in the lobby, inhaling oatmeal, fruit cups and coffee. At 7:30, they were at the hospital. By 8, they were in a conference room with dozens of county and state health officials for what Kuhar called “a meet-and-greet.”
“We’re here to assist you,” he told the anxious crowd. “Our immediate priority is contact tracing – contact with people who might be at risk of becoming sick.”
The doctor spoke for nearly an hour. Low-key and soft-spoken, Kuhar has a naturally calm disposition. At the end, he took questions. Few were asked. He wasn’t really surprised.
He understood it was all so new, so confusing for these people, but he made it clear there was a plan in place and a protocol to deal with those who had been exposed.

Vizag to be developed as smart city with U.S. aidVizag to be developed as smart city with U.S. aid

Visakhapatnam, Oct. 1:  
The importance of Visakhapatnam as a port city in South India has been recognised for a long time but there seems to be an added impetus to the growth of the city after the bifurcation of the State, even though Vijayawada has been chosen as the capital due to its central location.
The prominence of the city got highlighted once again when it figured along with Ajmer and Allahabad during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US tour. The three cities have been identified for development with the funding and assistance of the U.S. as smart cities. The Prime Minister had announced during his election campaign here that he would ensure that the city gets is rightful recognition as a gateway for international trade and keeping his promise he has managed to get the U.S. to promise its support to Vizag.
According to State BJP president and Visakhapatnam Member of Parliament K. Haribabu, it clearly showed the Prime Minister's commitment to the development of Vizag and there should be no doubts now on the future of the city. “The decision to set up the State Capital near Vijayawada has been taken only in view of the central location of the city in AP and it would in no way mar the prospects of Visakhapatnam. Vizag is the largest and fastest growing city in AP,” Haribabu said. He said the city was on the priority list of both Prime Minister Modi and Union Minister for Urban Development Venkaiah Naidu, and "both have many things planned for its future."
O. Naresh Kumar, the CEO of Symbiosys, a local IT company, expressed happiness that the U.S. had come forward to fund Visakhapatnam as a smart city. He said the city would grow into a premier IT destination and as a port it was as important on the east coast as Mumbai on the West. It is a key location in the nation’s Look East Policy both on defence and commerce fronts.
Ch Ramakotaiah, a member of the national executive of the Builders' Association of India, said the Prime Minister's interest in developing Visakhapatnam as a smart city was quite evident and the people's representatives from the region should make use of the opportunity and strive for its balanced growth.

MORENA DISTRICT
Literacy: 71.03%
Sanitation status: Nirmal Gram Puraskars to 15 villages between 2008 and 2011
Mohini Sahariya is in Class VI, one of the rare girls to reach middle school in her Maanpur village surrounded by the forests of Pahadgarh block in Morena district. Unlike most other members of her nomadic community who bathe only once every few days — with soil — she bathes daily, and as she points out, combs her hair “sometimes even twice a day”.
When it comes to going to the toilet though, Mohini has little choice. Every morning, the 13-year-old heads into the jungle along with her mother, aunts and grandmother. The women of Sahariya tribe don’t look for a clearing deep in the bushes or wait for the dark. It’s acceptable for them to go in groups, squat together and
A road being built nearby and other construction activity, however, have made Mohini more wary. She heads deeper in, she says, to protect herself from “prying boys and men who whizz past in bikes”.
Lately, she has enforced a change among the women of her family too. The Sahariyas usually clean with soil after their morning rituals, but she and her relatives now carry a lota of water to wash themselves.
Most of the panchayats of Pahargarh block are dominated by the Sahariya tribe. They are still to “even smell” the benefits of the UPA’s Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA), says Zakir Hussain of NGO Sujagriti Sansthan.
Or those of the BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh government’s own ‘Maryada (honour) campaign’, launched three years ago. A policy document introducing the campaign to district officials states, “Mahilaon ke liye swachhata sirf swasthya ki drishti se hi avashyak nahin, balki yeh unki maryada aur suraksha ka bhi prashna hai (Cleanliness is vital for women not just in terms of health but is also a question of their honour and protection)”.
The Maryada programme encourages weekly meetings of women in villages, and toilets for women employees such as anganwadi workers and midday meal cooks at the village level. Says project incharge of the Total Sanitation Campaign division of Morena district, Kamal Yadav, “We see women as natural leaders. Our programme started with Nal Jal Yojana, focusing on providing toilets to 122 panchayats with access to water.”
However, against a target of 30,000 toilets in 2012-13, only 6,462 toilets had been made in Morena; in 2013-14, against 35,267 targeted toilets, only 9,672 could be realised. This year the target has been lowered to 33,487 toilets, of which 4,252 had been constructed till August.
The Sahariyas, notified as a special backward tribe by Madhya Pradesh, routinely hit the news over high incidence of malnutrition, and starvation death and pulmonary tuberculosis cases. Their children live on chillis with roti continued…

Chicago Confidential: Business books I ve liked..."Nudge" by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein, 2009
The demand for organ transplants far exceeds the supply.
To encourage donation, most states use what Thaler and Sunstein describe as an explicit consent rule, meaning people have to take some kind of action — usually checking a box — to indicate they want to be a donor.
What if you flipped it so the default position is everyone is a donor unless they check a box to opt out?
Many countries in Europe have adopted such a change. Or what the authors would call a nudge.
The effects are large. According to research from Eric Johnson and Daniel Goldstein cited in the book, Germany's opt-in system saw only 12 percent of its citizens give consent. Meanwhile, Austria's opt-out saw nearly the entire eligible population (99 percent) sticking with the default and agreeing to be a donor.
The book is chock full of examples, including two from Illinois, of how policymakers can use good program design and nudges to get people to make wiser choices.
Perfect for … Anyone who cares about public policy issues.
Not so much … The U.S. donation rate is still higher than in many opt-out countries because of the "superiority of the American medical system in quickly matching consenting donors with recipients, delivering the organs, and performing successful transplants," Thaler and Sunstein write. In other words, a nudge often isn't enough. Still, the book is worth your time.
"Getting Past No: Negotiating in Difficult Situations" by William Ury, 2007
A sequel to the bible of negotiations, "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In" by Ury and Roger Fisher, this book must be read over and over again — as the prescriptions contained in it are easier said than done.
"When you find yourself facing a difficult negotiation, you need to step back, collect your wits, and see the situation objectively," Ury writes. "Imagine you are negotiating on a stage and then imagine yourself climbing onto a balcony overlooking the stage. The 'balcony' is a metaphor for a mental attitude of detachment."
One way to do this is to slow down conversations by saying, "Let me just make sure I understand what you're saying."
Or take notes and ask your counterparts to repeat what they said. Asking for clarification gives people time to think. Reacting, Ury writes, is "the biggest mistake you can make."
Perfect for … Anyone going through a divorce, anyone in the middle of a salary or other career-related negotiation.
Not so much … None. Good for everyone.

Magma may have made  Man in the Moon : StudyMagma may have made 'Man in the Moon': Study

NASA This is a spectacular high-Sun view of the Mare Tranquillitatis pit crater revealing boulders on an otherwise smooth floor. This image from LRO's NAC is 400 meters (1,312 feet) wide, north is up.
NASA These images from NASA's LRO spacecraft show all of the known mare pits and highland pits. Each image is 222 meters (about 728 feet) wide.
Washington, Oct 2:  
Scientists have found that the 'Man in the Moon' image on the lunar surface was created by a large plume of magma deep within the Moon's interior.
New data obtained by NASA's GRAIL mission showed that the Procellarum region on the near side of the Moon - a giant basin often referred to as the "Man in the Moon" - likely arose not from a massive asteroid strike, but from a large plume of magma deep within the Moon's interior.
The Procellarum region is a roughly circular, volcanic terrain some 2,896 km in diameter.
Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Colorado School of Mines, and other institutions have created a high-resolution map of the Procellarum, and found that its border is not circular, but polygonal, composed of sharp angles that could not have been created by a massive asteroid.
Instead, researchers believe that the angular outline was produced by giant tension cracks in the Moon's crust as it cooled around an upwelling plume of hot material from the deep interior.
Maria Zuber, MIT's Vice-President for research, said that as cracks occurred, they formed a "plumbing system" in the Moon's crust through which magma could meander to the surface.
Magma eventually filled the region's smaller basins, creating what we see today as dark spots on the near side of the Moon - features that have inspired the popular notion of a "Man in the Moon."
The team mapped the Procellarum region using data obtained by GRAIL - twin probes that orbited the Moon from January to December 2012.
From this mapping, the researchers observed that the rim of the Procellarum region is composed of edges that abut at 120-degree angles.
As asteroid impacts tend to produce circular or elliptical craters, Zuber said the Procellarum's angular shape could not have been caused by an impact.
Instead, the team explored an alternative scenario: Some time after the Moon formed and cooled, a large plume of molten material rose from the lunar interior, around where the Procellarum region is today.
The steep difference in temperature between the magma plume and the surrounding crust caused the surface to contract over time, creating a pattern of fractures that provided a conduit for molten material to rise to the surface.
To test the hypothesis, the researchers modelled the region's gravitational signal if it were to contain volcanic intrusions - magma that seeped up to just beneath the Moon's surface and, over time, cooled and crystallised.
The resulting simulation matched the gravity signal recorded by GRAIL, supporting the idea that the Procellarum was caused by a magma plume, and not an asteroid.

India brought the curtains down on their campaign in the 17th Asian Games, maintaining their domination of kabaddi with two gold medals as the country rose a rung to eighth in the overall standings.
The two gold medals provided the final flourish for India at the Games, which can be considered a disappointment for the country given that the overall medal count went down in this edition.
Although the women's team won their match against Iran quite comfortably, it was not a cakewalk for the men's team which literally overcame a scare before notching up their seventh successive gold medal in the event.

With two gold medals coming, India were placed eighth on the table with a total haul of 57 medals -- 11 gold, nine silver and 37 bronze. China continued to be at the top with an impressive haul of 329 (145-103-81) followed by hosts South Korea 222 (75-70-77) and Japan 190 (46-72-72).
The medal collection was well below India's expectation as they had managed a haul of 65 -- 14 gold, 17 silver and 34 bronze -- in the previous edition of the Games in Guangzhou.
With no Indian participation on the last day of competitions tomorrow, the country's overall standing can change depending on others' performance.
On Friday, staging a fantastic second-half recovery, Indian men surged to gold by defeating Iran 27-25 in a thrilling final at the Songdo University Gymnasium.
India thus completed a golden double on the kabaddi mat for the second successive edition after the women defeated the same nation 31-21 in their final held earlier in the day.
The country thus boosted its overall gold tally to 11 on the final day of competitions here.
But it was touch and go for the Indian men, who have won the gold medal with ease on the six previous occasions since kabaddi was introduced in the 1990 Games at Beijing. They played catch-up with Iran for most part of the game before drawing level with the last seven minutes of the 40-minute match left. .
The winners were trailing by a big margin of 13-21 at half time and a huge upset was on the cards before the defending champions pulled it around in the second half with some aggressive raiding and smart catching.
Captain Rakesh Kumar played with a bandaged head after getting injured by a rival defender's knee during his raid in the second half.
Rakesh said at half time, the strategy chalked out was to pack off Iran quickly for a 'lona' -- with only four players of the rivals left as compared to their own five -- at that stage and come back into the game.
India started on the wrong foot against the super-fit Iranians who looked like men possessed as they raided with gusto and defended with zeal to jump to a 17-7 lead before the Indians, who even conceded a 'lona' (after being all out), knew what happened.
Experienced raider Jasvir Singh appeared to be a bit overconfident and paid the penalty for that as he was packed off when raiding thrice in the initial stages.
It was left to India's most experienced player Anup Kumar to pull in three points with a good raid and narrow the lead.
With five minutes left for the end of the opening half, India trailed 11-18 which became 13-21 before the first half ended.
The crucial turnaround happened soon after the start of the second half when India secured a 'lona' and then caught up with their rivals at 21-all.
They, however, slipped down to 21-24 before staging another recovery to catch up at 24-all when seven minutes were left.
Anup raided to secure a valuable point to help India lead 25-24, the first time they had done in the entire match.
They added one more when Iranian's fast raider Meraj Sheykh was caught and though Anup failed in his next raid, Meraj was again caught just as the clock ticked to full time with India ahead by two points.
Earlier, Indian women too staged a strong second half performance to get the better of a fighting Iran 31-21 to retain the gold.
The Indian women led 15-11 at the halfway stage of the 30-minute final but then put up a determined show in the second half to maintain their supremacy for the second edition running, having clinched gold when the event made its debut four years ago in Guangzhou.
They, in fact, had only a two-point lead at 12-10 soon after securing the first of their two lonas (all outs) in the gold medal contest against the fitter-looking Iranian women who played with head scarves and leggings.
Abhilasha Mhatre then effected a crucial raid to not only get back two points for her side but also revive two players who had been packed off by Iran's aggressive raider Khalaj Ghazal.
Thereafter, India took firm control from the first five minutes of the second half following a strong raid by Abhilasha Mhatre to take a 19-15 lead.
They got another timely lona in the seventh minute to lead 25-16 and there ended Iran's hopes though they tried to stage a fight back towards the end.
Iranian women were in tears after the loss, having come here with a mission to dethrone India for the gold medal. The team even had a computer software engineer and a doctorate in agriculture in its ranks.
There was, however, no cheer for India's taekwondo players at the Asian Games with Shaloo Raikwar and Margarette Maria losing their respective quarterfinal bouts.
Shaloo lost her 73kg quarterfinal bout to Alfahad Abrar of Kuwait. Both the players finished 3-3 after the regulation four rounds but Abrar was declared 'Winner on Superiority' as the Indian had conceded two penalty points against her rival's one.
Later, Maria lost 1-15 to China's Li Donghua in the 73kg quarterfinal.
In volleyball, India prevailed over Qatar 3-2 in a hard-fought contest to finish fifth in the men's volleyball competition.
In men's 5th-6th place classification match at the Songnim Gymnasium here, the Indians rallied to beat the Qataris 25-21 20-25 25-22 20-25 15-10 in a keenly contested match, which lasted an hour and 47 minutes.

A Brief History of America s Attitude Toward Taxesreddit
This post first appeared on Harvard Business Review's blog, and is posted in conjunction with the publication of the October 2014 issue of the magazine's feature article , "The Rise (and Likely Fall) of the Talent Economy," which can be read in full here .
The changing attitudes toward and laws around income taxes has been a major driver of the rise of America's modern talent-based, knowledge economy.
Two things strike me as I study the history. First, it is hard to see the historical development of US income taxation as a gradual evolution. Rather, it is characterized by major swings. Second, it is interesting to see a very consistent cycle in the tax treatment of the super-rich. I think that today we are approaching an inflection point. Unless we do something about the current set up, the tax system may end up as a major factor in the fall of that talent economy.
As I see it, the tax system has moved through four distinct eras over the last century and a half. During each era, government and society subscribed to a theory about what taxes were for, which was eventually replaced by another theory, flipping us into another era. Let's look at how the pendulum has swung and how the treatment of the super-rich has changed. All the data is from the very handy Tax Foundation website. I have inflated all the incomes to 2013 dollars to make comparisons more easily understood.
The First Era: 1862-1915
From its inception in 1862 and up to 1915, personal income tax was not unlike a modern-day state sales tax: a percent or two of income, with richer folks paying a slightly higher level. For example, in 1915 a $1 million earner paid income tax at a 2% rate. Like a sales tax, income tax was seen primarily as a revenue earner and not as a tool for influencing behavior. It was only mildly progressive: the rate was 1% on incomes up to about $450,000. In this era, the rich (e.g., $1 million earners) were taxed exactly the same as the super-rich (e.g., $10 million earners).
The Second Era: 1916-1931
In 1917, with the First World War at its height, Congress passed the War Revenues Tax Act, which changed thinking about personal income taxation dramatically. The new theory was that personal income tax could fund the war effort. And within that funding, rich people could and should pay more -- and the super-rich much, much more.
Under the new Act, rates skyrocketed: a $1 million earner paid a 16% rate and the top marginal rate, which kicked in at $36 million, was a hitherto unimaginable 67%. A year later the rates went up still further: 43% for the $1 million earner and a 77% top rate kicking in at a $15 million income level.
After the war ended, rates drifted back down (the top rate went down to 25% in 1925) though the prewar rates were gone forever. But interestingly, the level at which the top rate kicked in fell all the way to $1.3 million by 1925. So although there had been a meaningful distinction between the rich and super-rich during the height of the war, after the war, they were all lumped together and the $36 million earner, who in 1918 had paid at a rate over four times that of the $1 million earner, was paying at the same rate in 1925-1931.
The Third Era: 1932-1981
The Great Depression precipitated the next big swing. The rate for $1 million earners shot up from 22% to 35% in one year between 1931 and 1932 and the top rate from 25% to 63%. Within just a dozen more years (1944) those rates were 84% and 94% respectively, with the top rate kicking in at only $2.6 million. At those rates, the average present-day mid-level investment banker would be giving the federal government all but 6 cents of his/her last dollar earned, which would seem to us to be a huge disincentive.
But in the third tax era, income of that scale was not typically assumed to something you could earn by working; it was something you derived by virtue of owning a particular asset, and earning from that asset what the economists call a "rent." According to the theory, most rich people were basically rentiers and their income from owned assets could -- and should -- be taxed at very high rates with no adverse impact on their behavior or the economy.
Financing WWII could have been used as an excuse for these highly confiscatory rates, but rather than dropping after the end of war, they continued to rise. By 1963, the $1 million earner was paying 89%. So in the mid-1960s, anybody in America that would be considered reasonably rich was keeping a mere 10% of marginal earnings -- and that is before paying all state, municipal and indirect taxes; with all of those added in, they probably kept less than 5 cents on the extra dollar.
From about 1960, however, the economy began to change, as I describe in this HBR article , with an increasing proportion of earnings and wealth being tied to value created by way of the exercise of talent through work. With this change there came a growing awareness that 90% personal income taxation had a disincentive effect. Between 1963 and 1981, therefore, the rate on a $1 million earner slid from 89% to 70%. But, somewhat paradoxically and echoing the 1920s, the level at which the top rate kicked in plummeted to $272,000 -- meaning that by 1981 virtually everyone who was upper-middle class or above paid the top marginal rate. There was no longer a distinction of any meaningful kind between rich and super-rich.
The Fourth Era: 1982-Present
It was not until the 1980s, by which time the idea that the economy was knowledge driven had firmly taken hold, that our lawmakers finally abandoned the prewar assumption that all rich people were rentiers and recognized that at the prevailing rates talented people were being put off work. Instead, the new theory was basically that all income should be considered to be the product of exercising talent and that people should be taxed less so that they had a motive to work.
But with the abandonment of the rich-as-rentier concept, lawmakers no longer drew a distinction between the rich and other folks, making it easier to justify reducing tax thresholds to compensate for falling rates. This is exactly what happened: in 1982 the top rate dropped to 50% but kicked in at $101,000. By 1988, it had fallen to 28% and kicked in at $29,000, which meant that America effectively had a flat tax of 28% (the 15% rate for incomes below $29,000 would have applied to very few fully employed Americans). Since then the top rate has drifted up to 39.6%, kicking in at $220,000. But the progressivity of the system is still extremely modest.
Towards a Fifth Era?
A quick look at this brief history dispels a common misperception among American Baby Boomers, Generation X's, and Millennials who all think the current system is "the way America taxes" because it is the only thing they have ever known. It is actually a modern phenomenon -- a product of the most recent theory change, in this case from a rentier theory, in which economic growth is seen as the product of exploiting assets, to a talent theory in which growth is driven by the exercise of talent and the application of knowledge.
The history also demonstrates that the current system of equal treatment of the rich and the super-rich (and in this case also of the same as the upper-middle class) is not typical or normal. Rather, it happens to be at one of the two poles across which the system has oscillated over history.
So will the current system endure? I think not. In times of crisis, America has shown that it asks the super-rich to pay a lot more than the rich and I think this will happen based on the feeling that it is a time of economic crisis in America. Also, although applying a rich-as-rentier theory (implying tax rates in the 70% plus range for high incomes) isn't really fit for purpose in a talent-driven economy, it's also not justifiable to have a maximum rate that doesn't distinguish between a mid-level executive and a hedge fund manager.
My bet is that the Fifth Era will look a lot like the early Third Era -- after the height of the Great Depression but before the inception of WWII. That is, $10 million earners paying in the 75% range, $1 million earners in the 50% range and $500,000 earners in the 35% range.
How high or low the rates of the Fifth Era structure will be will depend, I think, on whether talent is seen as engaging primarily in trading value or primarily in creating value for their fellow citizens (in terms of better products and services and more jobs). If it is the former, they will be taxed more highly as unworthy rentiers and there will be little concern for incentive effects. If the latter, they will be taxed as important economic assets whose incentives must not be dampened. Right now, sentiment is trending more in the former direction than in the latter -- a perception that the talented people on the Forbes 400 list have done little to dispel.

You don’t get the chance to buy most mutual funds on the cheap. But after co-founder Bill Gross’ sudden departure from Pimco, some of its funds are suddenly selling at discounts.
USA TODAY
We’re talking here about Pimco’s closed-end funds, which sell on the stock market just as exchange-traded funds do. But unlike ETFs, closed-end funds don’t have a mechanism that keeps the fund’s market price in line with the value of the securities in its portfolio.
The practical effect: Sometimes, closed-end funds sell for less than the value of what they own — called a discount, in closed-end parlance. Pimco Dynamic Credit fund (ticker: PCI ), for example, has averaged a 7% discount the past 12 months, according to Morningstar. But the fund now sells for a 8.6% discount — despite the fact the Gross never managed the fund.
“People panicked,” says Erik Herzfeld, manager of the Virtus Herzfeld fund . “We saw that, and it was a no-brainer to start buying.” The fund is managed by a team headed by Gross’ successor, Daniel Ivascyn.
Pimco’s funds that were once managed by Gross still sell for hefty premiums — something that puzzles Herzeld, because there’s usually no reason to pay a premium for a closed-end fund. Pimco Global Stocks PLUS ( PGP ), for example, has averaged a 61.84% premium the past 12 months. It’s selling for a 61.3% premium. “We’re surprised it hasn’t traded down more,” Herzfeld says.

Kabaddi kings survive a scare  challenger vows a gold the nexttimeIndian players celebrate their victory over Iran in gold-medal match in Incheon on Friday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Mihir Vasavda | Incheon | Posted: October 4, 2014 4:36 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 9:52 am
As the two teams stood in the corridor leading to the playing arena before the kabaddi final, the Iranians broke into an All-Blacks haka of sorts. With in-the-face aggressive gestures, they tried to provoke the Indians. It didn’t seem to be working, though — the undisputed world champions merely smirked.
As the match progressed though, the smirks would be replaced by worry lines verging on panic. Raw aggression had given the Iranians a 21-13 lead at the end of the first half. The major upset looked on the cards. Since kabaddi was introduced as a demonstration sport at New Delhi in 1982, and as a medal sport at Beijing in 1990, India had steamrolled all opponents. Finally, a challenger had emerged.
A second-half recovery saw India draw level at 24-24, with 7 minutes to go. They did escape to victory ultimately — 27-25 — but Iran had made a point.
After the match, with the silver medals hanging around their necks, the Iranians went about shattering myths and building a few of their own. “Kabaddi has been played in Iran for centuries. We gave the sport to India,” claimed the manager, Majid Bahrami.
He said he had first played the sport 30-odd years ago. “I spent my childhood playing the sport on rooftops, during lunch breaks in school, and on barren, pebble-packed grounds.”
Every region in Iran apparently has its own name for the sport. In Khorasan and Mazandaran, it is known as Zu-Zou, in Gilan it’s called Do-Do and, in Khuzestan, Ti-Ti. When raiders enter the opponents’ half, they just say “Zu” while holding their breath, instead of the familiar “kabaddi, kabaddi”.
Iran has some 100 kabaddi clubs for both men and women — many in the north-eastern province of Golestan. Yet, Iran has largely refrained from participating in international tournaments, mainly because the sport was seen only as a leisure activity.
The country began to take the sport seriously only in the last decade or so, the captain of the side, Fazel Atrachali, said. Its popularity cannot be compared to volleyball or football, he said.
“All these years, India has said they invented the sport. But the fact is that it was first played in Iran centuries ago, and then picked up by India. However, India have been the better exponents of the game, and have made it so popular,” Atrachali said.
In terms of success at the World Cups, Iran are currently second only to India. This was their third appearance at the Asian Games, and the side emerged as the top challenger to India. Iran were the runners up at the Guangzhou Asiad as well, losing to India in a one-sided final.
Their performance on Friday, however, showed just how far they’ve come. India have been cautiously monitoring their progress, and acknowledge the threat Iran continued…

Dubai: Dubai police plan to issue detectives with Google Glass hands-free eyewear to help them fight crime using facial recognition technology, a police spokesman in the wealthy Gulf Arab emirate said.
The wearable device consists of a tiny computer screen mounted in the corner of an eyeglass frame and is capable of taking photos, recording video and playing sound.
The spokesman confirmed a report in Dubai's 7 Days newspaper that software developed by Dubai police would enable a connection between the wearer and a database of wanted people.

#google #glass #internet #wearables
Once the device "recognised" a suspect based on a face print, it would alert the officer wearing the gadget.
The gadget would be used in a first phase to combat traffic violations and track vehicles suspected of involvement in motoring offences. A second phase would see the technology rolled out to detectives, the spokesman said.
The US Internet company said in a blogpost in May that anyone in the United States could buy the gadget for $1,500.
Dubai's decision appears in line with the authorities' determination to spare no expense in equipping the police.
Last year Dubai announced it would supply its police with $400,000 Lamborghini sports cars for use at major tourist sites. Dubai's deputy police chief said the vehicles were in keeping with the Gulf capital's image.
Dubai, one of seven emirates in the UAE federation, is staging a recovery from the financial crisis it suffered during the global financial crisis in 2009. The emirate recently announced several big projects, including a huge tourism and retail development with the largest shopping mall in the world.

Chennai: Protests continued across Tamil Nadu on Friday against the conviction of AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case and the party's Puducherry unit has decided to observe a "dawn-to-dusk" bandh in the Union Territory on Saturday.
Many shops were shut in Kancheepuram, Erode, Dharmapuri and Villupuram districts, among others, even as "Amma" (as Jayalalithaa is popularly known) loyalists conducted special prayers at temples, churches and mosques in different places, seeking divine intervention for her release from a Bangalore prison.
Police said no untoward incidents were reported from anywhere in the state.
A special court in Bangalore sentenced Jayalalithaa to four years' simple imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 100 crore in disproportionate assets case.

In Kancheepuram, a section of fisherfolk did not venture into the sea while party supporters tonsured their heads at Sholinganallur in the district as a mark of protest.
A human chain protest was held at Madurai even as party workers observed fast in many places including Pudukottai, Erode, Dharmapuri, Chennai, Krishnagiri and Kancheepuram.
The party proposed a day-long fast by its MLAs at the memorial of AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran (MGR) at the Marina beach in Chennai on Saturday even as cable operators loyal to AIADMK mulled suspending operations on Saturday.
The party's Puducherry unit has called for a 12-hour bandh in all four regions of the Union Territory -- Pondicherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam -- to protest the "false case" imposed against Jayalalithaa.
AIADMK's Uppalam town secretary A Ravindran told reporters that the bandh would commence from 6 AM.
A special court in Bangalore sentenced Jayalalithaa to four years' simple imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 100 crore in 18-year-old disproportionate assets case. Three others convicted were also given four years' simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs 10 crore each.

Patna Stampede: Union ministers attack Bihar government15

New Delhi: Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan on Friday sought to blame Bihar government over the Patna stampede incident, saying it failed to learn from the past and put in place measures to prevent the tragedy.
"It is not only an unfortunate and regrettable incident but also shameful. Dussehra festivities take place in Gandhi Maidan every year. Still no appropriate arrangements were made... recently there was an incident during Chhatt puja. There was an incident during Narendra Modi's rally in October last year," Prasad said.
He was referring to the blasts which rocked Modi's rally venue.
Prasad and Paswan plan to visit Patna on Saturday to take stock of the situation. Both are from Bihar.

Prasad said while he has spoken to Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, a team of NDRF has already left for Patna to assist the state administration.
The Law Minister said that the Centre will render all possible assistance to the state government to deal with the situation.
Prasad and Paswan plan to visit Patna on Saturday to take stock of the situation. Both are from Bihar.
Expressing grief, Paswan attacked the JD(U) government in Bihar for allegedly failing to put in place measures to prevent the tragedy.
He said similar incidents had taken place during Chhatt Puja in Bihar but the state government has "failed to learn lessons."
At least 32 people, including 27 women, were killed and 22 others injured in the stampede that took place this evening at Gandhi Maidan in Patna shortly after the Dussehra celebrations.

Private employers added 213,000 jobs in September, payroll processor ADP said Wednesday, possibly signaling that the government's closely watched report this Friday will show a rebound in employment growth.
Economists had estimated that ADP would report 207,000 private-sector job additions.They predict the Labor Department's report Friday will show 215,000 payroll gains by businesses and governments, according to the Action Economics survey's median forecast.
ADP said small businesses added 88,000 jobs; mid-size ones, 48,000 and large companies, 77,000.
Trade, transportation and utilities led the job gains, with 38,000. Manufacturers added 35,000, and professional and business services, 29,000.
"Especially encouraging most recently is the increasingly broad base nature of those gains," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which helps ADP compile the report. "Nearly all industries and companies of all sizes are adding consistently to payrolls."
ADP and Labor track similar trends, but ADP's count has differed from Labor's private-sector job tally by an average 34,000 since Moody's Analytics began helping ADP compile the data nearly two years ago, according to High Frequency Economics. Last month, ADP reported that businesses added 202,000 jobs in August, while Labor's estimate was 134,000. Overall payroll growth slowed to 142,000 after six straight months of 200,000-plus gains, Labor said.
Many economists note that other labor market indicators have been positive recently, including initial jobless claims that have fallen to pre-recession levels. They expect the government to revise up the August figure.
The ADP total for September "supports our view that the disappointing 142,000 gain in official payrolls last month was just a blip," Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.
Labor's report on September job gains should be bolstered by the return of 17,000 striking workers, says Jim O'Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.

The major upset looked on the cards. Since kabaddi was introduced as a demonstration sport at New Delhi in 1982, and as a medal sport at Beijing in 1990, India had steamrolled all opponents. Finally, a challenger had emerged.
A second-half recovery saw India draw level at 24-24, with 7 minutes to go. They did escape to victory ultimately — 27-25 — but Iran had made a point.
After the match, with the silver medals hanging around their necks, the Iranians went about shattering myths and building a few of their own. “Kabaddi has been played in Iran for centuries. We gave the sport to India,” claimed the manager, Majid Bahrami.
He said he had first played the sport 30-odd years ago. “I spent my childhood playing the sport on rooftops, during lunch breaks in school, and on barren, pebble-packed grounds.”
Every region in Iran apparently has its own name for the sport. In Khorasan and Mazandaran, it is known as Zu-Zou, in Gilan it’s called Do-Do and, in Khuzestan, Ti-Ti. When raiders enter the opponents’ half, they just say “Zu” while holding their breath, instead of the familiar “kabaddi, kabaddi”.
Iran has some 100 kabaddi clubs for both men and women — many in the north-eastern province of Golestan. Yet, Iran has largely refrained from participating in international tournaments, mainly because the sport was seen only as a leisure activity.
The country began to take the sport seriously only in the last decade or so, the captain of the side, Fazel Atrachali, said. Its popularity cannot be compared to volleyball or football, he said.
“All these years, India has said they invented the sport. But the fact is that it was first played in Iran centuries ago, and then picked up by India. However, India have been the better exponents of the game, and have made it so popular,” Atrachali said.
In terms of success at the World Cups, Iran are currently second only to India. This was their third appearance at the Asian Games, and the side emerged as the top challenger to India. Iran were the runners up at the Guangzhou Asiad as well, losing to India in a one-sided final.
Their performance on Friday, however, showed just how far they’ve come. India have been cautiously monitoring their progress, and acknowledge the threat Iran continued…

A Louisiana Restaurant Is Giving A 10 Percent Discount To Gun Carriersreddit
A Louisiana cajun restaurant thinks your smoked ribs and fried catfish would go better with a side of firearms.
Bergeron's Restaurant in Port Allen, Louisiana, is giving gun-toting customers a 10 percent discount on their meal after a series of national chains have banned guns in recent months.
"There are people here with guns, this is not a gun-free zone," Kevin Cox, the owner of Bergeron's, told The Huffington Post in a phone call. "So if you want to cause trouble, you can think about who you're sitting next to."
Cox told HuffPost that the deal was originally designed to encourage law enforcement officers to visit the Cajun restaurant, but was then broadened to welcome all gun carriers.
"It makes us all feel better when state patrol, police and sheriff's department come in and have lunch here because you know when they're here we're safe," Cox said. "And I realized that we have a lot of good people that carry a firearm in Louisiana -- my cousins and relatives included -- and I'm equally as safe when they're here, and I need to encourage that."
Advocates for open-carry gun policies have recently forced some chain restaurants and retailers to clarify their policies on guns. Chipotle and Target adopted no-gun policies after gun rights activists flaunted their weapons in the stores.
Cox said the recent gun bans inspired his unique discount, and that firearm bans actually invite crime.
"So now you have a choice: You're going to go to Bergeron's and cause trouble or you're going to go to Chipotle and cause trouble," Cox told HuffPost. "I don't think they're going come here if they're going to find good people carrying their guns."
It is legal to openly carry firearms in Louisiana without a permit, as long as you're over 18 years old and not prohibited from having a firearm under federal or state law.
Cox told NBC33, an NBC affiliate in Baton Rouge, that he's been giving out 15 or 20 of the discounts each day .
He said "business is taking off" since the deal was introduced and reported by media outlets, and customers are driving from all over the region to show their support for the restaurant.
The gun discount may or may not leave a bad taste in your mouth, but
at least the Bergeron's BBQ is consistently tasty.

NY Post Settles Lawsuit Over Infamously Horrific CoverNY Post Settles Lawsuit Over Notorious 'Bag Men' Cover
 | By                                                                DENISE LAVOIE
reddit
BOSTON (AP) — The New York Post has settled a defamation lawsuit over a cover three days after the Boston Marathon bombing that featured a photo of two Massachusetts residents with the headline "Bag Men."
Neither side would disclose terms of the settlement. A document filed in Suffolk Superior Court late last week said only that the two sides have stipulated to dismissal of the lawsuit and that all parties were waiving their right to appeal.
The Post's April 18, 2013, front page had a photo of Salaheddin Barhoum and Yassine Zaimi standing near the marathon finish line with the headline "Bag Men." The sub-headline was "Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon."
Barhoum and Zaimi, who were spectators at the marathon, said the story damaged their reputations and caused emotional distress. The Post emphasized that it did not name the men and never called them suspects in the attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260.
Lawyers for both sides said in court filings that emails circulating among law enforcement in the days after the bombing support their opposing arguments.
The Post said the emails, unsealed by a judge in August, showed that authorities were looking for the men and wanted to identify them, including one email that included the words "BOLO," — short for "be on the lookout" — and "Boston Marathon Bombing Terrorist Suspects."
Lawyers for Barhoum and Zaimi, however, cited an email that appeared to have been sent by a Department of Homeland Security agent that said the men shown in the picture were "not of interest" and that an original request for identification was based on "bogus intel."
The story was published at a time when authorities were frantically trying to determine who was responsible for the attack. Later that day, the FBI released photos of two suspects in the bombing who were later identified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, of Cambridge.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police the following day. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and is awaiting a trial in January. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
Barhoum's lawyer, Max Stern, and Jeffrey Robbins, a Boston lawyer who represents the Post, declined to discuss the details of the settlement. Both called the resolution "amicable."
Zaimi's lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The NY Times Has Had A Really Bad Yearreddit
2015 is still a few months away, but the folks at the New York Times are probably wishing that they could throw 2014 in the dumpster now, given how challenging this year has often been.
The announcement on Wednesday that the paper was slashing hundreds of jobs and retooling its troubled digital products was just the latest in a string of bad news for the Times in 2014.
First and foremost, of course, was the highly messy and controversial firing of editor Jill Abramson, which opened up a bitter row over her legacy, the paper's general treatment of women , and the way publisher Arthur Sulzberger handled all of it. (The consensus on that last point was "very badly." )
But other issues have plagued the Times too.
In 2014, the paper had to watch as rivals like the Guardian and Washington Post took the lion's share of the Pulitzer glory for their reporting on the NSA and Edward Snowden. It then saw a less-than-flattering internal report about its digital future get leaked to BuzzFeed. Then came the Abramson fallout.
Over the past couple of months, the Times has also found itself embroiled in multiple rows about its handling of race, from its description of slain teenager Michael Brown as "no angel" to Alessandra Stanley's infamous column about TV impresario Shonda Rhimes.
The good thing for the Times is that it's been through even worse periods than this. Nobody, for instance, would want to trade 2014 for the nadir that was 2003, when the paper suffered through the Jayson Blair scandal and its disastrous reporting on Iraq's non-existent weapons of mass destruction.

Jaya spent Rs 3 crore on foster son s wedding: CourtComments
Holding that it was AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa who had paid for the arrangements for the lavish marriage of her now estranged foster son V N Sudhakaran, the special court in the disproportionate assets case against her pegged the expenses incurred by her at Rs 3 crore.
Sudhakaran's marriage, dubbed as "mother of all weddings" was held in 1995 when Jayalalithaa was Chief Minister and had raised a huge controversy, inviting public criticism for ostentation, protests and petitions to court.
"It is established in evidence that huge amount was spent towards the printing of invitation, publication of thanks in the dailies, 'tamboolam' and valuable presents given to the guests, all of which would certainly entail an expense of more than Rs. three crores even by modest and conservative estimation," Special Judge John Michael D' Cunha said.
"Taking into consideration all the above facts and circumstances, a sum of Rs. three crores is taken as the expenses incurred by A-1 (Jayalalithaa) towards arrangement for the marriage of A-3 (Sudhakaran)," he said rejecting their contention that the expenses were met by the bride's family.
The judge noted that oral and documentary evidence produced by the accused in support of their defence is "replete with the inconsistencies and irreconcilable contradictions".
The evidence indicates that the arrangements were sponsored by Jayalalithaa and at her instance all the arrangements were made and even the payment was made by her, he said.
The prosecution had come up with the case that over Rs. six crore was spent for the marriage.
The judge also said that witnesses have clearly stated that VIPs were invited and had attended the marriage and accommodation was arranged for them in hotels, the payment of which was made by Jayalalithaa.
"All these circumstances falsify the contention of the accused that the marriage expenses were met by the family of the bride," he said.
The prosecution had come up with the case that a sum of Rs. 6,45,04,222 was spent for the marriage, out of which, Rs. 5,21,23,532 were spent for putting up pandals.
Though the said amount looks exorbitant, but having regard to the accommodation provided to more than 40,000 to 50,000 people at two places and special arrangements made for the stage and decoration, the said amount does not appear to be unreasonable, the judge said.
The judge said it has come in evidence that a number of cooks were employed and were paid wages, elaborate sitting arrangements were made at the venue, posh accommodation was arranged for the VIPs, elephants were procured from Kerala, crackers were burst and the entire venue was illuminated with lights, which would certainly entail huge expenses.
"Therefore, taking into consideration all the above facts and circumstances, a sum of Rs. three crore is taken as the expenses incurred by A-1 towards the arrangement for the marriage of A-3," the judge said.

Officials: Higher risk for 10 exposed to Ebola patientBy Mark Berman October 3 Follow @markberman

Public health officials say “approximately 10 people” who had contact with the Ebola patient in Texas are considered at higher risk, though they emphasized Friday that none of these people had exhibited any Ebola symptoms.
“All of those individuals are doing well,” David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in a conference call with reporters. “There’s no additional individuals who have symptoms consistent with Ebola at this time.”
Another 40 people are also still being monitored , but these people are considered low-risk, Lakey said.
The people being monitored include health-care workers and other members of the community who encountered Thomas Duncan, who earlier this week became first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States.
Now that public health officials have been able to talk to everyone they considered at risk of possible contact, the overall number of people still being monitored has been cut in half since Thursday, when authorities said they were tracking 100 people .
The family that hosted Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan could be confined for three weeks. Health officials are reaching out to as many as 100 people who may have had contact with Duncan or someone who knows him. (AP)
“We’ve cast a wide net,” said Beth P. Bell, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s center for emerging and infectious diseases. “We have a very low bar for deciding to follow patients. We’re not suggesting by this that … we have a great deal of concern about all of these people, because the reality is we have a low level of concern about the vast majority of these people that we’re following.”
The process of figuring out who to track, which is called contact tracing, involved interviewing Duncan, as well as anyone who had gone into the Dallas apartment where he was staying.
Anyone considered a high-risk person needed to be observed closely over the coming days and weeks. The list is expected to shrink again going forward, but the danger to those at highest risk would not, at least for the time being.
“Everyone who worked in the ER that night, all the way down, were at risk,” said David Kuhar, an infection control medical officer at the CDC. “You cast as wide a net as possible and then you just whittle down, whittle down.”
The CDC team split up to track down anyone who may have been exposed. Half of them stayed at the hospital to look over a list of anyone known to have had contact with Duncan from the time his symptoms began, while others met with the people in the apartment where he had stayed.
Duncan had been staying with Louise Troh at her apartment since arriving in the U.S. from Liberia on Sept. 20. He began getting ill by Thursday, at which point he sought medical treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Despite the fact that he said he had traveled from West Africa and had a fever and some abdominal pain, he was diagnosed with a low-grade virus and released.
His condition worsened in the days that followed, as he developed a worse fever and felt weak and cold, before he ultimately was brought back to the hospital Sunday in an ambulance. He was placed into isolation and diagnosed Tuesday.
A person with Ebola is only contagious when they are exhibiting symptoms, which means that Duncan may have been contagious for up to four days before he was placed in isolation.

Troh, her son, a relative and a friend who had been living in the apartment at the time have been quarantined inside the home, with an official order barring them from leaving until at least Oct. 19 . Duncan also had contact with the three-member ambulance team that transported him to the hospital and health-care workers at the hospital itself. No other patients at the hospital interacted with Duncan, Lakey said.
The apartment where Duncan was staying had not been cleaned  until Friday afternoon, so the sheets he slept on as well as his other belongings had been sitting in sealed plastic bags in a separate room from the four quarantined people.
Authorities initially had trouble finding a company willing to do the cleaning, and once they found a company, there were new issues involving the permits allowing the company to dispose of items Duncan had touched.
“We were unable to accomplish that due to some permitting issues yesterday,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, the top elected official in the county, said in the same phone call Friday afternoon. He said that the permits still had not been obtained to dispose of these items, but said the process was “underway.”
A hazardous materials team was at the Ivy Apartments on Friday afternoon , as officials said they intended to remove all of the the bagged or otherwise contaminated items. These items were placed in large waste drums as the family waited in another room.

“The focus is to get all the material and hazardous waste out of that apartment,” Sana Syed, a spokeswoman for the city of Dallas, told reporters outside the apartment complex.
Syed tweeted photos of the team that was taking things out of the apartment on Friday afternoon:

Tragedy strikes Patna s Gandhi Maidan on Dussehra; 32 dead  50 injured in stampedeBlame game after 33 killed in Dussehra day stampede in Patna

At least 33 people were killed and more than 50 injured on Friday in a stampede, shortly after Dussehra celebrations had ended at Gandhi Maidan in the heart of Patna.

The incident occurred around 7.05pm at Ram Ghulam Chowk in front of the southern exit of the Maidan, as a crowd of over 70,000 was leaving the venue after watching giant effigies of Ravana set ablaze.
Around 26 people were admitted at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) with two of them seriously injured, said Patna district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma.
Eyewitnesses claimed the stampede was triggered by rumours that some people had come in contact with a live wire.
In the ensuing panic, slippers and shoes were seen strewn on a 500-metre-stretch as people tried to flee from the scene. “There was such a rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over,” Verma said.
Locals also blamed the absence of any lighting at the venue for the accident. “No preparation was in place to account for the mass exit by thousands of people from a single gate in darkness at the same time,” said a man present at the spot.
Angry spectators raised slogans against the administration for allegedly closing an exit near the western side of the venue for VIP movement. The Maidan has four exits but only two were used on Friday, they claimed.
The state government also announced ex-gratia of Rs. 3 lakh each for the next of kin of the dead. A high level probe has been ordered, said home secretary Amir Subhani. Health secretary Deepak Kumar has been deputed at the PMCH to coordinate medical facilities.
The Centre also announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased and a compensation of Rs. 50,000 for critically injured.
Identity of the deceased is yet to be ascertained.
Rapid action force (RAF) team was rushed to the spot where the stampede took place and the police resorted to a mild lathi charge to disperse protestors and miscreants resorting to arson, said a TV report showing visuals of the late evening development.
A woman injured in the stampede claimed even though the stampede was triggered by rumour of a 'live wire' coming in contact with some people exiting the venue, an earlier police lathi charge to control the stampede ended up worsening the situation.
The scene at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), where the injured had been admitted, was tense as the hospital had run out of medicines.
People had gathered outside the central casualty of the hospital in large number, but were unable to get any information about the dead or the injured.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences and spoke to the Bihar chief minister to enquire about the stampede.
"The stampede in Patna is deeply saddening. I spoke to the Bihar CM about the situation.My condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and prayers with the injured," he tweeted.

Union communication minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was also critical of the lapses on part of the state government and said the government is closely monitoring the situation.
Shameful that so many ppl died in Patna from where i come from on Dusshera day. Raavan Dahan happens every year at historic Gandhi Maidan.

Why adequate steps were not taken? It is indeed very unfortunate. My deepest condolences with the families in this hour of grief.

Congress President Sonia Gandhi also expressed "shock and grief" over the deaths and injuries.
"Dismayed at the unfortunate incident, Gandhi expressed the hope that the injured are being adequately attended to and conveyed her condolences to the families of those who passed away," a Congress statement said.
Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan has sought a probe by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) into the administrative lapses, leading to the stampede.
Talking to ANI in New Delhi, he said that the MHA should seriously ponder about conducting an inquiry into today's stampede as well as the one last year during the Chhath festival. He said he would travel down to Patna on Saturday.
BJP leader CP Thakur, who visited the hospital, said: "Prima facie the stampede appears to be due to administrative lapses."
Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, in a tweet, squarely blamed the state government for administrative failure, leading to the stampede.
This is the second such tragedy in Patna in less than two years. During the Chhath festival in  November 2012, 21 people had died in a similar stampede.
The Gandhi Maidan has a capacity to accommodate up to 4.5 - 5 lakh people. It is the same venue where a series of explosions took place during the Lok Sabha campaign event of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that left six dead.

Shoppers Stop, High Street Phoenix mall, others spruce up playlists to woo youngsters

(Malls, stores in India are…)
MUMBAI: Move over Kenny G Make way for Pharrell Williams , Daft Punk , Arctic Monkeys , 5 Seconds of Summer and more. Malls and stores in India are getting rid of the muzak and sprucing up their playlists with pop and rock hits as they look to entice younger shoppers and keep them from shifting wholesale to online retail. India's largest department store chain, Shoppers Stop , is among those that has changed its in-store soundtrack to communicate the brand message and, more importantly, put people in the mood to spend.
"The whole idea is to treat the customer with a complete sensorial experience while shopping," said Vinay Bhatia, vice-president, marketing, loyalty and analytics at Shoppers Stop, which also has a fortnightly Artist Spotlight that focuses on a performer who's got a new album coming out or a tour lined up. "It's not just what you see but also what you hear that makes the difference in helping customers stay longer at our stores, which could eventually increase purchase size."
Several brands and mall developers are now using cheery tracks to push up the tempo, getting rid of the traditional ambient piano or pan pipe music.
To be fair, many retailers have always played tracks through in-store radio networks that also double up as channels for promotional announcements. But in-store music has now become a much more important part of the overall mix. Mumbai's High Street Phoenix mall complex, which houses more 150 brands, has begun playing different varieties of music in specific zones. Last month, it also hosted a number of gigs by artists performing in various genres.
"Shoppers are really discerning and look for something new. Things like (a high standard of) housekeeping and air-conditioning are passe and the next step is to tickle them with entertainment," said Rajendra Kalkar, senior centre director at Phoenix Mills, home to High Street Phoenix, which changes playlists every two hours. Given the importance of getting the music right, big chains and mall owners are turning to specialists who can design playlists to match the values of the brand and the imagery that needs to be conveyed. For instance, The Smiths' Shoplifters of the World Unite may not be considered entirely appropriate despite the retail reference.
Phoenix Mills gets its collection put together by experts in Hong Kong and Singapore while Shoppers Stop's playlists are drawn up by Blue Frog, which runs clubs, music studios and a record label and other related businesses.
"The most crucial demand of retailers is how they can replicate the same ambience across hundreds of stores spread in many cities. While this has been a pain point for them, music has never been a focus earlier," said Kumaran Mahendran, founder of Moojik, which provides radio services to retailers for around 1,000 per store annually. "With a ready dashboard, the retailer can manage music and announcements across stores from their office itself."
For retailers, it isn't a big cost either, according to the experts, at 5 per square foot annually as fixed cost. This new musicality is not without its problems-sometimes shoppers ask for specific songs to be played or even a compilation CD that they can buy, both of which are not possible. But on the other hand, getting a teen to go shopping may become a little less difficult-which is what the retailers hope to achieve.

Stocks soar on 3rd anniversary of last correctionStocks soar on 3rd anniversary of last 10% correction

Despite ongoing fears of a 10% drop in the broad U.S. stock market, shares surged on Wall Street Friday – exactly three years after the end of the last official market correction.
A few days ago, on the first day of October, stocks were in free fall and talk of a coming stock market correction were growing louder on Wall Street. Fears about the first Ebola diagnosis in the U.S., street protests in Hong Kong, smalll-company stocks plunging into correction territory, global growth fears, and angst over October’s reputation as a scary month for stocks took its toll on stock prices.
But today the world looks much brighter, thanks to super-strong job growth in September and no signs yet that the Hong Kong crisis will spin out of control or the Ebola crisis will morph into a major economic crisis.
The benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500, which bottomed out Wednesday just 3.2% down from its Sept. 18 record closing high of 2011.36, is up 1.2% to 1969 and the Dow is more than 200 points higher.
The irony is today marks the third anniversary of the last correction, or drop of 10% or more. It’s been exactly three years and 36 months since the S&P 500 ended a 19.4% slide that began on April 29, 2011 and ended on Oct. 3, 2011, according to data provided by Bespoke Investment Group. Corrections normally occur every 18 to 20 months.
As a result, the correction-less market continues.
Thomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, says trying to predict when a correction will strike is virtually impossible.
“I have not found any reliable way to call when a market is about to have a correction,” says Lee. “People that make calls for a 10% drop are guessing. And when too many people are guessing the same thing that means it’s not going to happen.”
Lee is bullish on stocks now despite all the recent hand-wringing over the bull market’s health.
“I think people should feel comfortable putting money into the market today,” he says.
Lee lays out a number of bullish drivers.
He says all the doom-and-gloom projections after the weak start to October are overblown. His statistics show that after a negative start (a drop of 1% or more) on the first day of the fourth quarter, gains have followed into year-end 92% of the time.
He also says so many mutual fund managers are trailing their market benchmarks that it is likely they will have to play catch up, which could give stocks a boost into year end.
“Forty-one percent of fund managers trailed their benchmark as of Oct. 1 and historical analysis shows that the worse the underperformance has been, the greater the eventual year-end rally,” Lee says.
 

Pimco funds on sale!By: John Waggoner October 3, 2014 3:31 pm

You don’t get the chance to buy most mutual funds on the cheap. But after co-founder Bill Gross’ sudden departure from Pimco, some of its funds are suddenly selling at discounts.
USA TODAY
We’re talking here about Pimco’s closed-end funds, which sell on the stock market just as exchange-traded funds do. But unlike ETFs, closed-end funds don’t have a mechanism that keeps the fund’s market price in line with the value of the securities in its portfolio.
The practical effect: Sometimes, closed-end funds sell for less than the value of what they own — called a discount, in closed-end parlance. Pimco Dynamic Credit fund (ticker: PCI ), for example, has averaged a 7% discount the past 12 months, according to Morningstar. But the fund now sells for a 8.6% discount — despite the fact the Gross never managed the fund.
“People panicked,” says Erik Herzfeld, manager of the Virtus Herzfeld fund . “We saw that, and it was a no-brainer to start buying.” The fund is managed by a team headed by Gross’ successor, Daniel Ivascyn.
Pimco’s funds that were once managed by Gross still sell for hefty premiums — something that puzzles Herzeld, because there’s usually no reason to pay a premium for a closed-end fund. Pimco Global Stocks PLUS ( PGP ), for example, has averaged a 61.84% premium the past 12 months. It’s selling for a 61.3% premium. “We’re surprised it hasn’t traded down more,” Herzfeld says.

Blow for KKR  Sunil Narine banned from bowlingMore
Narine banned from bowling in CLT20 final
He was reported by the umpires after the semi-final against Hobart Hurricanes on Thursday, which Knight Riders had won by seven wickets.

Sunil Narine of the Kolkata Knight Riders
Sunil Narine has been barred from bowling for Kolkata Knight Riders in the Champions League T20 final on Saturday after being reported for a second time in two matches for a suspect action. He was reported by the umpires after Thursday's semi-final against Hobart Hurricanes, which Knight Riders won by seven wickets. He had also been reported following their final group match, against Dolphins, when the umpires questioned his quicker delivery.
ESPNcricinfo understands that this time the umpires, Rod Tucker, S Ravi and Vineet Kulkarni, had noted in their written complaint that several of the 24 deliveries Narine bowled against Hurricanes were suspect. "It was three deliveries in the last match. But this time all his four overs were reported," an official privy to the complaint said.
REACTION - Clive Lloyd livid with decision | Narine pulled out of India tour
No official from Knight Riders' management responded to queries, so it is not yet known whether the franchise might appeal against the penalty.
According to a Champions League T20 release, the umpires reviewed footage of the semi-final and "felt that there was a flex action in Narine's elbow beyond the acceptable limit when bowling during the match". He had already been on the tournament's warning list and, since he had not subsequently had his action cleared, is now automatically banned from bowling further in the tournament.
Knight Riders will now be "advised" to send Narine to the Sri Ramachandra University in Chennai - which has been accredited by the ICC as a testing centre for suspect bowling actions - to have his action tested.
The bowling ban will not affect his West Indies duties, though - it is confined only to the Champions League T20 and other BCCI-organised tournaments, including the IPL.
Darren Sammy , Narine's West Indies team-mate, came out in support of him on Thursday, prior to him being reported a second time. "I am not worried. Narine is a champion. Whether they stop him from bowling the faster ball, he is still the most dangerous spinner in the world," Sammy had said. "I believe that he will still be a great asset to us. He will do whatever he has to do and have all his different tricks up his sleeves by the time the World Cup is here. I still feel he will be our a champion spinner."
Narine is the fourth bowler to be reported in the Champions League - the others are Lahore Lions' Adnan Rasool and Mohammad Hafeez , and Dolphins' Prenelan Subrayen. However, he is the first bowler to be reported a second time. This comes at a time when the ICC has been stepping up its action against suspect bowling actions, with several spinners being called and suspended from bowling in international cricket.
It comes as a big blow to Knight Riders, as they look to extend their T20 winning streak to 15 and secure the double of winning the IPL and the Champions League T20 in the same year.

RSS chief Bhagwat s speech covered just like a news event: DDPrint

Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 3, 2014 2:48 pm | Updated: October 3, 2014 2:57 pm
Amidst a controversy over the national broadcaster telecasting live a speech of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Doordarshan on Friday said it was covered like any other news event and no special arrangements had been made.
“It was just like a news event to us. So we covered it,” Doordarshan’s DG (News) Archana Dutta said, after the DD’s hour-long live telecast of an RSS function for the first time came under attack from Congress and the Left which accused the government of misusing the state broadcaster.
She said that there was “no special arrangement” that had been made for the event and one of the several Digital Satellite News gathering vans (DSNG) that the broadcaster has in Maharashtra for coverage of the state elections was used for the event.
“We have several DSNG vans in Maharashtra and one such van was used for Nagpur,” Dutta said.
BJP has defended the telecast with party leader Shaina N C saying that the RSS is only a nationalist organisation which believes in ‘India first’ and the country above the interest of any individual.
“I am glad that this speech has been highlighted and people realise that if there is one cadre in the country today that has genuinely contributed to patriotism and nation- building, it is the RSS,” she said.
Congress spokesman Sandeep Dikshit termed the hour-long telecast as a “dangerous tradition”, saying RSS is a controversial religious and political organisation.
Condemning the live broadcast, CPI(M) said, “The RSS uses the occasion propagate its Hindutva ideology. The national public broadcaster has no business to telecast live the speech of the chief of an organisation like the RSS.” The CPI also condemned the live telecast.
BJP defended the telecast with party leader Shaina N C saying that the RSS is only a nationalist organisation.

Jadavpur University protest: 13 students detained by police in Salt LakePress Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: October 3, 2014 7:56 pm
Thirteen students were detained by the police in Salt Lake area on Friday, who were staging a protest rally in solidarity with the protest by Jadavpur University students, who were allegedly beaten up by police on the night of September 16.
The students from various colleges gathered near Laboni area in Salt Lake, near a Puja Pandal and started raising slogans against the alleged crackdown by police on Jadavpur University students on September 16, following the gherao of Jadavpur university VC.
“We have detained 13 students as we apprehended that they might create problem during the Durga puja ceremony,” officer in charge of Bidhannagar North Police station Santanu Koar said.
Thousands of students had marched through the city’s streets on September 20 demanding the VC’s resignation .
West Bengal Governor K N Tripathi who is also the Chancellor of the University has intervened to end the stalemate in the prestigious institution, where students continue to boycott classes. Those in the mass communication department also boycotted their examination on September 18.

Gujarat refuses to permit SIT plea challenging Maya Kodnani s bailPress Trust of India | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 3, 2014 9:27 pm
The Gujarat Government has refused permission to the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team to challenge the bail given to former Minister Maya Kodnani in a post-Godhra riot case.
Kodnani, who was given bail by Gujarat High Court, was convicted in the Naroda Patia riot case – in which 97 people were killed – and awarded 28-year jail term by the trial court.
“We have taken a decision of not granting permission to SIT to file an appeal before the Supreme Court to challenge bail to Kodnani on the basis of some past judgements of the apex court,” Law and Justice Secretary V P Patel said.
Kodnani, who handled Women and Child Development portfolio in the then Narendra Modi Cabinet, was granted bail by the High Court on July 30 on health grounds.
Prashant Desai, Special Public Prosecutor representing SIT, said the State Government had sought his opinion on challenging Kodnani’s bail in the apex court.
“When Mayaben Kodnani was granted bail by the High Court, the State Government sought my opinion on whether or not to file an appeal in the Supreme Court.
“Looking into the situation and facts of the case, I was of the opinion that there is a remote chance of success. Despite my opinion, the Gujarat Government has all the authority to go to the Supreme Court,” Desai maintained.
The HC had granted bail to the former MLA considering her submission that she suffered from acute depression and tuberculosis, for which she is being treated at Ahmedabad City Civil Hospital.
Kodnani’s sentence was also suspended till her appeal against the trial court order is disposed by the High Court. Kodnani, who was convicted as a ‘kingpin’ of the massacre, was sentenced to a 28-year jail term by a special trial court in Naroda Patia area of Ahmedabad city, and she became the first convict in the Naroda Patia case to get regular bail from the Gujarat High Court.
The three-time legislator was also the first woman to be convicted in a post-Godhra riots case.
Kodnani, who was a BJP MLA representing Naroda at the time of the 2002 riots, was made Minister of State for Women and Child Development in the 2007 Narendra Modi-led Gujarat cabinet.
However, Kodnani had to resign after her arrest in the case in March 2009.
In August 2012, a special SIT court had awarded life imprisonment to then BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi and 29 others for their roles in the 2002 riots in Ahmedabad at Naroda Patia.
The massacre had taken place a day after the Godhra train burning incident of February 27, 2002.
The Naroda Patia massacre case is one of the nine cases investigated by the Supreme Court appointed SIT which probed Godhra and post-Godhra riots in the year 2002.

Teach  Big 4  a lesson in Assembly polls: Raj Thackeray tells voters14
0
Jalna (Maharashtra): Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray on Friday slammed all four major parties - Shiv Sena, BJP, NCP and Congress - saying they have become "arrogant" and asked people to teach them a lesson in the October 15 polls.
These political parties have become "arrogant" over the years and their leaders show no compunction in changing their loyalties, he said, addressing an election rally in support of the local MNS candidate at Tirathpuri village near here in North Maharashtra.
He lambasted NCP leader Ajit Pawar for his "urination" remarks made at a public meeting in a village in Pune district in April last year. Ajit, then the Deputy Chief Minister, had apologised for the controversial remarks made in the context of water shortage in parts of Maharashtra.
These political parties have become "arrogant" over the years and their leaders show no compunction in changing their loyalties, Thackeray said.

"How can the people tolerate such leaders,"? he asked. Such leaders should be asked what they had done for the people, the MNS chief said and called upon the voters to keep the four parties away from power to safeguard interest of the State.
Raj said water scarcity is a major problem in Marathwada region, where crores of rupees have been embezzled by officials and politicians in the name of solving the issue.

New video shows Islamic State group beheading British hostage Alan HenningNew ISIS video shows beheading of British hostage
AP

An internet video released on Friday shows an Islamic State group fighter beheading British hostage Alan Henning, the fourth such killing carried out by the extremist group now targeted in US-led airstrikes.
The video mirrored other beheading videos shot by the Islamic State group, which now holds territory along the border of Syria and Iraq, and ended with a militant threatening a man they identified as an American named Peter Kassig.
"Obama, you have started your aerial bombardment of Shams (Syria), which keeps on striking our people, so it is only right that we continue to strike the neck of your people," the masked militant in the video said.
National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden confirmed that Kassig was being held by Islamic State militants, in a statement issued on Friday evening.
"At this point we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video released earlier today (Friday). We will continue to use every tool at our disposal - military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence - to try to bring Peter home to his family," Hayden said.
The Associated Press could not immediately verify the video's authenticity, though it was released in the same manner as other Islamic State group videos and the masked militant sounded similar to the one who carried out the other slayings.

Britain has been supporting US military efforts against the Islamic State group by using British forces to help with logistics and intelligence gathering, as well as recently taking part in airstrikes in Iraq. The internet video released Friday begins with a news clip announcing British strikes against the Islamic State group.
Read: British PM Cameron confirms 'brutal murder' of Henning by Islamic State group
British Prime Minister David Cameron said Henning's apparent slaying showed "how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are."
"Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need," Cameron said in a statement. "The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these... terrorists.
"We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice."
President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, said the US had seen the video and was evaluating it.

Later, Obama said the United States strongly condemned Henning's "brutal murder." He said the US, along with Britain and other allies, will "work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder" to justice and will continue to "taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic State group.
French President Francois Hollande said he is "outraged by the heinous crime."
"This crime like previous ones will not be unpunished. France will continue to lend support to the people and authorities of Iraq in their fight against terrorism," Hollande said in a statement.
On Friday night, the UN Security Council condemned the video, saying it "once again illustrates the brutality" of the Islamic State group, adding that its members believe "such continued acts of barbarism perpetrated by ISIL do not intimidate them but rather stiffen their resolve."
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group. The full beheadings are not shown in the videos, but the British-accented, English-speaking militant holds a long knife and appears to begin cutting his victims, who include American reporter James Foley, American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and now Henning.
FBI director James Comey has said American officials believe they know the identity of the masked militant, though he's declined to name the man or reveal his nationality.
Kassig, a 26-year-old American now threatened by the Islamic State group, enlisted in the Army in 2004, and became a Ranger, ultimately serving in the 75th Ranger Regiment, an Army special operations unit.
According to his military record, Kassig trained at Fort Benning, Georgia in 2006, and deployed to Iraq from April to July 2007. He was medically discharged at the rank of private first class in September 2007. His home of record at the time of his enlistment was Indianapolis, Indiana.
His parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, issued a statement through a media relations firm, asking for the world to pray for their son.
"The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning. We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration," the statement said. "We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe."
The family said Kassig had been working for the relief organization SERA when he was captured on October 1, 2013 on his way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria. He converted to Islam while in captivity and the family has heard from former hostages that his faith has provided him comfort.
Henning, 47, nicknamed "Gadget," had joined an aid convoy and was taken captive on December 26, shortly after crossing the border between Turkey and Syria. Earlier this week, Henning's wife Barbara Henning asked the militants in a televised plea: "Please release him. We need him back home."
Dozens of Muslim leaders in Britain have urged the Islamic State group to release Henning. His wife had said she had been given hope by "the outcry across the world" over her husband's imprisonment.
Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Henning "a British hero."
His "barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world," Shafiq said.
The Islamic State group has its roots in al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody 3-year civil war in neighbouring Syria, growing stronger to the point of being able to launch a lightning offensive across much of northern Iraq, routing security forces there and shooting down an Iraqi helicopter on Friday. The group has become known for filming and releasing footage of mass shootings it conducts, as well as beheading opponents and targeting religious and ethnic minorities in the areas it attacks.
The extremist group has been widely denounced by mainstream Muslim authorities.
Other foreigners are believed held by the Islamic State group. On Friday, the father of John Cantlie, a British photojournalist held by the group, appealed for his release in a video, saying he was a friend of Syria.

The incident occurred around 7.05pm at Ram Ghulam Chowk in front of the southern exit of the Maidan, as a crowd of over 70,000 was leaving the venue after watching giant effigies of Ravana set ablaze.
Around 26 people were admitted at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) with two of them seriously injured, said Patna district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma.
Eyewitnesses claimed the stampede was triggered by rumours that some people had come in contact with a live wire.
In the ensuing panic, slippers and shoes were seen strewn on a 500-metre-stretch as people tried to flee from the scene. “There was such a rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over,” Verma said.
Locals also blamed the absence of any lighting at the venue for the accident. “No preparation was in place to account for the mass exit by thousands of people from a single gate in darkness at the same time,” said a man present at the spot.
Angry spectators raised slogans against the administration for allegedly closing an exit near the western side of the venue for VIP movement. The Maidan has four exits but only two were used on Friday, they claimed.
The state government also announced ex-gratia of Rs. 3 lakh each for the next of kin of the dead. A high level probe has been ordered, said home secretary Amir Subhani. Health secretary Deepak Kumar has been deputed at the PMCH to coordinate medical facilities.
The Centre also announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased and a compensation of Rs. 50,000 for critically injured.
Identity of the deceased is yet to be ascertained.
Rapid action force (RAF) team was rushed to the spot where the stampede took place and the police resorted to a mild lathi charge to disperse protestors and miscreants resorting to arson, said a TV report showing visuals of the late evening development.
A woman injured in the stampede claimed even though the stampede was triggered by rumour of a 'live wire' coming in contact with some people exiting the venue, an earlier police lathi charge to control the stampede ended up worsening the situation.
The scene at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), where the injured had been admitted, was tense as the hospital had run out of medicines.
People had gathered outside the central casualty of the hospital in large number, but were unable to get any information about the dead or the injured.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences and spoke to the Bihar chief minister to enquire about the stampede.
"The stampede in Patna is deeply saddening. I spoke to the Bihar CM about the situation.My condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and prayers with the injured," he tweeted.

Union communication minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was also critical of the lapses on part of the state government and said the government is closely monitoring the situation.
Shameful that so many ppl died in Patna from where i come from on Dusshera day. Raavan Dahan happens every year at historic Gandhi Maidan.
— Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) October 3, 2014
Why adequate steps were not taken? It is indeed very unfortunate. My deepest condolences with the families in this hour of grief.
— Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) October 3, 2014
Government of India is very closely monitoring the situation.
— Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) October 3, 2014
Congress President Sonia Gandhi also expressed "shock and grief" over the deaths and injuries.
"Dismayed at the unfortunate incident, Gandhi expressed the hope that the injured are being adequately attended to and conveyed her condolences to the families of those who passed away," a Congress statement said.
Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan has sought a probe by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) into the administrative lapses, leading to the stampede.
Talking to ANI in New Delhi, he said that the MHA should seriously ponder about conducting an inquiry into today's stampede as well as the one last year during the Chhath festival. He said he would travel down to Patna on Saturday.
BJP leader CP Thakur, who visited the hospital, said: "Prima facie the stampede appears to be due to administrative lapses."
Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, in a tweet, squarely blamed the state government for administrative failure, leading to the stampede.
This is the second such tragedy in Patna in less than two years. During the Chhath festival in  November 2012, 21 people had died in a similar stampede.
The Gandhi Maidan has a capacity to accommodate up to 4.5 - 5 lakh people. It is the same venue where a series of explosions took place during the Lok Sabha campaign event of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that left six dead.

Forbes: The combined wealth of Forbes’ 2014 ranking of the richest people in America “The Forbes 400” (p. 125 of the October 20, 2014 Forbes magazine issue) is $2.29 trillion, up from $2.02 trillion in 2013 and the highest ever, partly due to the strength of the U.S. stock market.  The average net worth of a Forbes 400 member is an astounding $5.7 billion, the highest to date, up from $5 billion last year.  Net worth increased for 303 members, and decreased for 36 members.  Cost of admission to the 2014 list is the highest ever at $1.55 billion, up from $1.3 billion a year ago.
For the complete Forbes 400 ranking on Forbes.com, click: here .
Bill Gates retains the top spot on The Forbes 400 for the 21st straight year, at $81 billion, up $9 billion from 2013. Warren Buffett (#2) is at $67 billion, up $8.5 billion from last year. Larry Ellison (#3), worth $50 billion, is up $9 billion from last year.  Steve Ballmer (#18), worth $22.5 billion, climbed back into the top 20 after dropping out last year.
Twenty-seven newcomers made it into the ranks, including Jan Koum (#62) of WhatsApp at $7.6 billion, Russ Weiner (# 249) of Rockstar Energy at $2.5 billion, Travis Kalanick (#190) of Uber Technologies at $3 billion, and David Walentas (#368), a real estate developer who made his fortune by rebuilding the Dumbo area in Brooklyn, New York, at $1.7 billion.  The biggest gainer is Mark Zuckerberg (#11), whose net worth grew $15 billion since last year; he is currently worth $34 billion. Nicholas Woodman’s fortune is up 200% to $3.9 billion, tripling from $1.3 billion last year, making the GoPro founder the largest percentage gainer this year (#129).

Forty-seven women are on the list, down from 48 last year. This year includes newcomer and self-made billionaire Elizabeth Holmes (#110), who founded Theranos, a Palo Alto company that is disrupting the business of blood testing.  Holmes is the youngest woman on The Forbes 400 list.  An additional five women are on the list as part of couples, including Jin Sook in Jin Sook & Do Won Chang (#90), Marian Ilitch in Michael & Marian Ilitch & family (#122), Lynda Resnick in Stewart and Lynda Resnick (#133), Judy Love in Tom & Judy Love (#167), and Peggy Cherng in Andrew & Peggy Cherng (#190).  Twenty-seven people who were on the 2013 Forbes 400 dropped off the list, and 6 people died.
The issue includes cover story Jerry Yang’s Revenge (p. 53), featuring an interview with Jerry Yang (#324), Yahoo cofounder and Alibaba board member. It details the inside story of how the Yahoo founder turned $1 billion into $50 billion with Alibaba and is the U.S. tech industry’s bridge to China.  The Exterminators (p. 100) reveals all the fighting within the Rollins family, as well as who poisoned the $8 billion Orkin pest-control dynasty.  Welcome to Gilbertville (p. 90) details Quicken Loans owner Dan Gilbert’s billion-dollar makeover of Detroit, and how it is one of the most ambitious human resources project in the history of American business.
For the first time ever Forbes has assigned a “self-made score” to each member of The Forbes 400 in an effort to better distinguish how far some list members have climbed to make the ranks. This measurement runs from 1 (inherited wealth, with no activity to build the fortune) to 10 (classic Horatio Alger saga). For perspective, Forbes also assigned scores for The Forbes 400 going back 30 years. The results showed an enormous shift from inherited wealth to self-made wealth at the very top. Even 20 years ago, more than half of The Forbes 400 came via inherited wealth. This year, more than two-thirds are self-made.
The Forbes 400 issue will feature five consecutive covers, including Jerry Yang, Yahoo cofounder and Alibaba board member, on the front cover; Steve Ballmer, former Microsoft CEO; Elizabeth Holmes, newcomer and the youngest woman on The Forbes 400 list; Dan Gilbert, the man who brought Lebron James back to Cleveland; and Leslie Wexner, the man behind Victoria’s Secret.

Walmart: Tracy Morgan Should ve Worn Seatbelt When Our Truck Hit HimWalmart: Tracy Morgan Partly To Blame In Truck Accident Because He Wasn't Wearing Seatbelt

DAVID PORTER, Associated Press
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Actor-comedian Tracy Morgan and other people in a limousine struck from behind by a Wal-Mart truck on a highway in June are at least partly to blame for their injuries because they weren't wearing seatbelts, the company said in a court filing Monday.
The filing was made in federal court in response to a lawsuit Morgan filed in July over the accident, which killed his friend James McNair, who was accompanying the former "Saturday Night Live" and "30 Rock" star back from a show in Delaware. Morgan spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said in the filing that the passengers' injuries were caused "in whole or in part" by their "failure to properly wear an appropriate available seatbelt restraint device," which it said constitutes unreasonable conduct.
An attorney representing Morgan and the other plaintiffs called Wal-Mart's contentions "surprising and appalling."
"It's disingenuous," attorney Benedict Morelli said. "It's not what they said they were going to do initially, which was take full responsibility. I'm very upset, not for myself but for the families I represent."
The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and punitive and compensatory damages. It says the retail giant should have known that its truck driver had been awake for more than 24 hours before the crash and that his commute of 700 miles from his home in Georgia to work in Delaware was "unreasonable." It also alleges the driver fell asleep at the wheel.
Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said in an email that the company "continues to stand willing to work with Mr. Morgan and the other plaintiffs to resolve this matter."
Passengers Ardley Fuqua and Jeffrey Millea and Millea's wife, Krista Millea, also are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Krista Millea was not in the limousine when the crash occurred but is a plaintiff because she has a related loss-of-services lawsuit stemming from the crash.
Truck driver Kevin Roper, of Jonesboro, Georgia, pleaded not guilty to death by auto and assault by auto charges in state court. A criminal complaint also accuses him of not sleeping for more than 24 hours before the crash, a violation of New Jersey law.
A report by federal transportation safety investigators said Roper was driving 65 mph in the minute before he slammed into the limo van. The speed limit on that stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike is 55 mph and was lowered to 45 mph that night because of construction.
Roper had been on the job about 13 1/2 hours at the time of the crash, the report concluded. Federal rules permit truck drivers to work up to 14 hours a day, with a maximum of 11 hours behind the wheel.

Big Pharma s Money Ties To Doctors Revealed. Kind OfBig Pharma's Money Ties To Doctors Revealed. Kind Of

Obama met with the newly elected Modi during his first trip to the United States as Prime Minister. AFP PHOTO/Brendan SMIALOWSKI        (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)
The Obama administration unveiled a website Tuesday that will shed some much-needed light on Big Pharma's relationship with doctors. Just not quite today.
Called Open Payments , it's a tool authorized by the Affordable Care Act that offers details on payments that drug companies and medical device makers give to physicians and medical school teaching hospitals.
The aim is to enable people to discover whether the doctors and hospitals they visit may have motives other than patients' best interests when they choose one drug or medical device over another that may be better or cheaper. Drugmakers have even been fined for making illegal payments to doctors to promote prescribing their medicines.
It's the largest attempt yet to reveal the financial ties between medical providers and the health care firms peddling their wares, and includes compensation that those companies give to doctors and hospitals in things like speaking and consulting fees, travel to industry conferences, and free meals.
For now, the database only includes a few months' worth of payments, and has other shortcomings that won't allow patients to fully vet their doctors and hospitals.
"This is an opportunity for the public to learn about the relationships among health care providers, and pharmaceutical and device companies,” Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a press release.
This first release of payments information reveals drug and device makers made 4.4 million payments to 546,000 doctors and more than 1,300 teaching hospitals from August through December of last year. In total, the payments were worth about $3.5 billion. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will add more numbers in the coming weeks , according to a press release. The first full-year accounting of payments won't come out until June. Drug and device companies are required to disclose this information under Obamacare.
The idea for Open Payments originated as the so-called Physician Payment Sunshine Act, the brainchild of lawmakers led by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and then-Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) in 2007. Eventually, patients will have a clearer understanding of where their doctors' and hospitals' financial interests may lie.
In addition to promoting transparency in general, making these payments public also may serve to reduce potential conflicts of interest by making health care providers think twice before accepting money from those companies.
But the first set of numbers in this huge new database only includes payments from a five-month period, which limits patients' and researchers' ability to track how closely tied one doctor or teaching hospital may be to the drug and device industries.
What's more, flaws in the data , which forced President Barack Obama's administration to delay the publication of these numbers, persist. As a result, there are payments not included in the database, and other information is listed without the names of the providers.
In short: You can search for your doctor or local teaching hospital, but the information you find might be incomplete, or even inaccurate.
ProPublica, a nonprofit journalism organization that maintains its own database of health care company payments to medical providers, offered a list of important reasons to be cautious about the numbers released Tuesday. The American Medical Association expressed similar misgivings . The AMA had called for the launch of the database to be postponed, as did the drug and device industries .
And if you do decide to start punching names into Open Payments, don't expect a Google-like experience. This is ProPublica's Charles Ornstein , a Pulitzer Prize-winning expert on data journalism and the subject of pharma and device payments to health care providers:
Gotta say, Open Payments website is NOT AT ALL consumer-friendly. Not sure it's journalist friendly. We have 3 people working now.

Ebola Stocks Jump On News Ebola Has Hit The U.S.reddit
Now that the deadly Ebola virus has arrived in the United States, there is only one logical thing to do: Buy stocks!
Yes, shares of companies that make, or are trying to make, Ebola vaccines and treatments jumped in after-hours trading on Tuesday on news of the first patient diagnosed with the virus in the U.S.
Here's a chart, courtesy of Google Finance, showing what happened to the stock price of NewLink Genetics Corp. , an Ames, Iowa, company working on an Ebola vaccine , just after the news broke. Because it's a little hard to read, we've added giant honking red arrows to point out the 14-percent jump that took place in a matter of minutes:
Also enjoying big stock-price jumps after hours are Tekmira Pharmaceuticals , up about 20 percent; BioCryst Pharmaceuticals , up 12 percent; and Sarepta Therapeutics , up 7 percent. All are working on Ebola treatments that might get tested and approved with a little more urgency now that the disease, which has already killed more than 3,000 people in Africa , has hit U.S. shores.

General Motors recalling 117,000 vehicles for stalling risk
AP
automobile
General Motors is recalling more than 117,000 vehicles from the 2013 and 2014 model years for a defect that could cause them to stall.
The recall involves the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban, Traverse, Express and Silverado; the Cadillac CTS, Escalade and Escalade ESV; the GMC Yukon, Yukon XL, Acadia, Savana and Sierra; and the Buick Enclave.
GM says metal slivers in the chassis control module could cause an electrical short. If that happens, the vehicle could stall.
GM knows of no accidents or injuries related to the defect. It believes only 1 percent of the vehicles being recalled are affected.
The recall includes 97,540 vehicles sold in the U.S. and 20,201 exported elsewhere. Around 4,500 vehicles haven’t yet been sold.
GM will notify owners. Dealers will replace the module for free.

Indian men win seventh kabaddi gold at AsiadIndian men's kabaddi team wins 7th consecutive Asiad gold
IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Fri 3 Oct, 2014
Print
Incheon, Oct 3: Defending champions India staged a late comeback to edge Iran 27-25 in the men's kabaddi final to retain their gold medal at the 17th Asian Games here Friday.
The Iranian team rode on its athleticism, speed and agility to give a scare to the much-vaunted Indian team, who were complacent for the most part of the match at the Songdo Global University Gymnasium.
But the Indians utilised their experience and kept calm to give the country its 11th yellow metal in the Incheon Asiad, moving up to sixth place in the standings.
Five-time world champions India, with a starting line-up of Rakesh Kumar, Jasvir Singh, Anup Kumar, Manjeet Chhillar, Navneet Gautam, Gurpreet Singh and Ajay Thakur, took things too lightly initially.
Iran, the silver medallist in the 2010 Guangzhou Asiad, surged to a 16-7 lead till the 14th minute when Indian skipper Rakesh managed three points to reduce the deficit to six points.
But Iran, who played without fear, got two 'lona' points to open a 21-13 lead at the end of 20 minutes.
Indian raiders - Thakur, Jasvir - raided too deep which led to their downfall.
Iran ousted 18 Indians in the first half as compared to 11 managed by the Indians. It looked like the western Asian country were on the verge of notching the biggest upset of the Games.
But as soon as the second half started, India showed their class and quality to equalise within five minutes.
India made some strategic changes and rested veteran defenders Gautam and Gurpreet and all-rounder Manjeet, with youngsters Subramaniam Rajguru, Surjeet Kumar and Nitin Madane brought in, which made the team quick and fresh.
But India suffered a big setback when skipper Rakesh was trapped and thrown on the side lane, which left him injured and also kept him out for the next eight minutes.
Iran again found its rhythm and went ahead 24-21.
However, India refused to give up and received a major boost when Jasvir collected two points on a raid while the defence came to the fore, bundling out three Iranians at the end.
In the second half, India ousted 12 Iranians and seized two 'lona' points while their opponent scored three points by knocking the Indians out and with the help of one more bonus point, they managed just four points in the second half.
Earlier in the day, Indian women's kabaddi team won the gold medal for the second consecutive time and with the men's team triumph, India's overall tally in the discipline in the continental Games, swelled to nine.
The two gold medals in kabaddi Friday helped India jump two places in the medal standings with 57 medals (11 gold, nine silver, 37 bronze).

Slack demand, cheaper imports force steel companies like JSW Steel to cut prices
ET Bureau Oct 4, 2014, 06.35AM IST

( Steel companies have…)
By Karnika Bahuguna
NEW DELHI: Major steel companies have reduced or rolled over prices of the commodity for October due to weak demand, fall in international prices and cheaper imports .
While JSW Steel has cut prices of long products by Rs 1,000 per tonne and those of flats by Rs 500-750, Jindal Steel and Power has rolled over prices for the month, senior officials of the company said. Flat steel products include slabs, hot and cold rolled coils, coated steel and tinplates, and find application in shipbuilding, automobile sector, packaging and appliances.
Long products include billets, wire rods, sections and rails, and are mainly used in construction and engineering industries. State-owned Steel Authority of India has also reduced prices of TMT bars by Rs 500 per tonne while keeping those of other products unchanged. Rashtriya Ispat Nigam has reduced prices by Rs 500-1,200 across product categories, according to company officials.
"International prices of steel are correcting substantially, with a fall in iron ore prices leading to cheaper imported products in the market. Steel prices have corrected by $20 (about Rs 1,250) in the last fortnight," an analyst with a domestic brokerage said. Steel companies usually take a call on product prices at the beginning of every month.
Delayed monsoon rains this year led to a slowdown in construction activity, thereby dampening the demand for steel.
Construction and automotive sectors are the major consumers of the commodity. However, the industry expects demand and prices to pick up after the festive season since October-March is considered a seasonally strong period for steel companies.

World needs Android  Hindutva: RSSmouthpiecePrint
Written by Liz Mathew , Raghvendra Rao | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 5:50 am
What’s common between the Android operating system for mobile phones and Hindutva or Apple Inc products and Islam? Or, do Chimpanzees have anything to do with ‘love jihad’? A lot, if one were to believe some recent editorials in Panchajanya, mouthpiece of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
“The world needs ‘Android’. The world needs Hindutva,” concluded the weekly’s August 16 editorial. Drawing parallel between the apple that tempted Adam and the Apple Inc products, the article says “in this age of mobile revolution, people are continuing to fall for the ‘apple’. “However, despite its all its attraction, the ‘Apple’ has some limitations too. Other than its own ‘products’ its ‘operating system’ does not support anything else. If you have faith in ‘Apple’, then you are welcome to that limited world where partnership with the others is prohibited and is a sin,” said the edit. It went on to state that for those who follow Islam, accepting others is a crime and is unpardonable.
“Those using Androids are free to download any of the lakhs of applications as per their choice.” It is like a neighbourhood Hindu family in which an exercise-loving, gym-going youth is a worshipper of lord Hanuman while his studious, music-loving sister worships goddess Saraswati, the edit says, adding that the freedom to make one’s own choice is Hinduism’s specialty. The only reason why Android is being lapped up the world over is because it offers unlimited fre-edom to make changes, much like Hinduism, it said.
In its August 30 editorial, the RSS mouthpiece invoked English primatologist Jane Goodall and her research on Chimpanzees to explain the dynamics of ‘love jihad’.
According to the editorial, Goodall found a group of chimpanzees, which fiercely protected its territory against other groups of chimps, their males patrolled the territories to attract the females from the warring groups, with the aim of producing as many children as possible, which in turn will make their group bigger and stronger. The editorial said there are human groups who see women as only child-producing machines, and who want to establish their strength through their ability to reproduce.
Hitesh Shankar, editor of Panchajanya who writes the editorial said there was no particular intention on presenting his argument in this way. “I am a person who can stand between Androids and Ramayana and look at both things. This is my way of writing,” Shankar said. He added that he has been getting good response especially from the youth to the editorials he writes. To attract more readers the weekly has laun-ched an ad campaign.

Angry Birds maker Rovio announced it will cut as many as 130 jobs, more than one month after detailing a change in leadership at the mobile game developer.
In a statement released Thursday , Rovio CEO Mikael Hed says the cuts will represent about 16% of the company's workforce.
"It is never easy to consider changes like this, but it is better to do them sooner rather than later, when we are in a good place to reignite growth," says Hed.
Hed also says Rovio will streamline to focus on three key parts of their business: games, media and consumer products.
In late August, Hed announced he would step down as Rovio CEO to lead the company's animation studios that handle Angry Birds movies and animated programming. Nokia veteran Pekka Rantala will take over as Rovio CEO on January 1, 2015.
Rovio launched Angry Birds for Apple's iOS devices in 2009, and it became one of the early blockbuster video games of the smartphone era. The franchise has topped more than 2 billion downloads of its games. However, Angry Birds has been overshadowed by newer hit titles including Candy Crush Saga and -- most recently -- Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.
Meanwhile, the company is pressing forward with an Angry Birds animated film slated to launch in summer 2016. Rovio announced the movie's voice cast, which includes Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Maya Rudolph and Peter Dinklage.

Islamic State beheads second British aidworkerThis undated image shows a frame from a video released Friday, Oct. 3, 2014, by Islamic State militants that purports to show the killing of former taxi driver Alan Henning by the militant group.
Reuters | Washington/beirut | Posted: October 4, 2014 7:54 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 10:06 am
Islamic State militants beheaded British aid worker Alan Henning in a video posted on Friday, triggering swift condemnation by the British and US governments.
The footage on YouTube, highlighted on pro-Islamic State Twitter feeds, showed a middle-aged man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling next to a black-clad militant in arid scrubland, similar to past Islamic State beheading videos of two American journalists and a British aid worker.
The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric these terrorists are. My thoughts are with his wife and their children.
— David Cameron (@David_Cameron) October 3, 2014
As in previous videos, Henning appears to read from a script before he is killed. “Because of our parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision,” he says.
Read: UK aid worker killed in third ISIS beheading
A male voice with a British accent says, “The blood of David Haines was on your hands Cameron,” in references to the slain aid worker and to Britain’s prime minister. “Alan Henning will also be slaughtered, but his blood is on the hands of the British parliament.”
Henning, a 47-year-old taxi driver from Salford in northern England, was part of an aid convoy taking medical supplies to a hospital in northwest Syria in December last year when it was stopped by gunmen and he was abducted.
In a posting on Twitter, Cameron said: “The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric these terrorists are. My thoughts are with his wife and their children.”
US officials said they had no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video, titled “Another Message to America and its Allies.”
“The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning,” President Barack Obama said in a statement.
“Standing together with our UK friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan’s murder — as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines — to justice,” Obama said, referring to other captives killed by Islamic State militants.
Near the end of the one-minute, 11-second video, the man in black introduces another hostage identified as American Peter Edward Kassig. His parents later issued a statement confirming their 26-year-old son had been taken captive while doing humanitarian work in Syria.
“We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe,” Ed and Paula Kassig of Indianapolis, Indiana, said in the statement.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Plenty's been written about the 2015 Ford F-150 pickup, but  some revelations remain.
Six things we learned about the new, aluminum-body pickup at an intense series of Ford briefings Tuesday night:
• Sign-makers are working up removable, sticky-film decals because magnetic signs won't stick to aluminum. You'll still be able to proclaim, "My kid's an honor student," or, "Best Gutter Cleaning in Three Counties" using the new slap-on appliques that independent retailers expect to be selling soon.
• Aluminum body didn't cut 770 pounds of weight. About 500 pounds. The rest is from lighter steel frame, heavy use of high-strength, lightweight steel throughout the truck. The frame is 78% high-strength steel, up from 22% in the 2014 F-150.
• The 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 Ford's promoting as a good blend of power, mileage will be a $495 option when the truck's launched late this year. discounted from the $795 sticker price to get dealers to order the engine and buyers to consider it. Power ratings: 325 horsepower, 375 pounds-feet of torque at 3,000 rpm. It will be able to tow 8,500 pounds. No official mpg ratings on it or the other powertrains until November. The 2.7 engine also will be offered as the high-performance choice in the new version of the Ford Escape Sport.
• Extended-cab trucks will have rear-hinged "suicide" doors that open 170 degrees – almost flat to the bed – for easier entry and exit.
• Rearview camera's still mounted in the tailgate handle. Ford didn't find a way around the fact that you drop the gate and you're blind backing up.
• Ford's working on ways to put 12-volt and 115-volt outlets in the cargo bed to charge tools, toys that ride in back. Challenges are how to make wiring invulnerable between cab and bed; how to make electric outlets impervious to car washes, rainstorms.

First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell further last week as the number of newly-jobless Americans seeking aid remained near prerecession levels, the Labor Department said Thursday.
That's a good sign for the job market and the declining trend may signal improving hiring conditions. The Labor Department will issue its September employment report on Friday.
Seasonally adjusted initial claims for jobless benefits in the week ending Saturday were 287,000, down from the previous week's revised total of 295,000, Labor reported.
The closely-watched four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility, held below 300,000 for the third straight week. That marks the longest interval under that level since 2006.
The four-week average of 294,750 was down 4,250 from the previous week's revised average of 299,000.
The U.S. labor market may have hit another healthy benchmark last month as well, according to the government's report. Its preliminary estimate of the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits  fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,398,000 in the week ended Sept. 20 -- the lowest figure since June 2006.
Economists predict the Labor Department on Friday will report employers added 215,000 jobs in September while the unemployment rate held steady at 6.1%, according to the median forecasts in Action Economics' survey.
Many economists also expect the government to revise up last month's estimate of August job gains, reported as 142,000. That was the lowest total for any month this year and broke a six-month string of gains above 200,000.

Syria Blasts At School Kill 32  Including 10 KidsSyria Blasts At School Kill 32, Including 10 Kids
 | By                                                                ALBERT AJI and DIAA HADID

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Twin bombings near an elementary school in Syria killed at least 32 people on Wednesday, including at least 10 children, with the second blast going off as screaming parents frantically searched for their sons and daughters in a street littered with school bags and body parts.
Syrian children are frequently among the victims of attacks in the country's civil war, but on Wednesday they appear to have been the target. The first vehicle exploded as children were leaving school, and the second struck as adults carried away bodies, sending a new wave of panic through the crowd.
The attack occurred outside the Ekremah al-Makhzoumi elementary school in a government-controlled area of the central city of Homs dominated by minority Alawites, the Shiite offshoot sect to which President Bashar Assad's family belongs. It was one of the deadliest incidents in the area in months.
The SANA state news agency said at least 32 people were killed and 115 wounded in the attacks. A local official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media, said immediately after the bombings that at least 10 of the dead were children.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll in the twin attacks at 39, including 30 children under the age of 12. It said the second blast was caused by a suicide bomber.
The discrepancy in the casualty figures could not be immediately reconciled, but tolls frequently differ in the chaotic aftermath of attacks.
In footage of the bombings posted on a pro-government Facebook page, one man shouts "Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Take him to the hospital!" as another man appears to drag away a child by his arms. Two little girls and a boy scream and cry as they are carried away.
Other people rush about, narrowly avoiding a child's severed head lying on the pavement. Smoke billows from a burning vehicle. As one boy tugs on a man's hand another blast goes off. A young girl covers her ears as others scream and run away. "Oh God! Oh God!" one man hoarsely shouts.
The video appeared genuine and was consistent with Associated Press reporting of events.
Homs Governor Talal Barazi described the blasts as a "terrorist act and a desperate attempt that targeted school children."
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Wednesday's attack, but Syrian rebels fighting to oust Assad have carried out numerous bombings in government-held areas of Homs.
All sides have carried out horrific attacks on civilians during the conflict -- now in its fourth year -- but rarely have children appeared to be the direct target.
In May, Syrian government forces bombed a complex in the northern city of Aleppo that housed a school alongside a rebel compound. At least 19 people, including 10 children, were killed in that incident.
Meanwhile, the Observatory reported Wednesday that militants of the Islamic State group beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women, captured in clashes near the Syria-Turkey border. Dozens of militants and Kurdish fighters were killed in the fighting, it said.
Images posted Wednesday on social media networks show women's heads placed on a cement block, said to be in the northern Syrian city of Jarablous, which is held by militants. The photos could not be independently verified but corresponded to Associated Press reporting of the event.
The Kurdish fighters were taken prisoner during the battle over the northern Syrian town of Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, according to the Observatory, which gathers its information from activists inside Syria.
The chief Kurdish group fighting in Syria, known as the YPG, advocates gender equality, and women fight alongside men.
Kurdish forces have been locked in fierce clashes with Islamic State militants in and around Kobani since the extremist group launched an assault in mid-September. The fighting has created one of the single largest exoduses in Syria's civil war, with more than 160,000 people fleeing into Turkey, U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said Tuesday.
More refugees streamed into Turkey from Kobani on Wednesday, according to an AP journalist on the border. Turkish authorities were registering them and busing them to refugee camps. Others were being picked up at the border by their relatives in Turkey.
Islamic State militants have staked out positions east, west and south of Kobani. Thick dark smoke could be seen rising from an area south of the town on Wednesday.
The Islamic State group has pressed its assault on Kobani despite airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition on its positions. The U.S. has been bombing the Islamic State group across Syria since last week and in neighboring Iraq since early August.
The U.S. military said American warplanes conducted three airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Syria near Kobani overnight and Wednesday, destroying an armed vehicle, an artillery piece and a tank.
U.S. and British warplanes also carried out five airstrikes in neighboring Iraq, knocking out two armed vehicles, a militant-occupied building and two fighting positions northwest of Mosul, the country's second largest city, which fell to the Islamic State group in June.
One strike near the Haditha dam in Anbar province destroyed an armed vehicle, while another air raid outside Baghdad eliminated two armed vehicles.

MIT, Twitter team up on $10 mn social media project
PTI
social networking
Twitter will provide full access to its real-time, public stream of tweets, as well as the archive of every tweet ever posted.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Twitter are teaming up on a $ 10 million project to better understand social networks and figure out new ways to benefit from them.
As part of the five-year partnership, Twitter will provide full access to its real-time, public stream of tweets, as well as the archive of every tweet ever posted.
The new Laboratory for Social Machines based at MIT’s Media Lab will focus on the development of new technologies to make sense of patterns across the broad span of mass media and social media.
“The Laboratory for Social Machines will experiment in areas of public communication and social organisation where humans and machines collaborate on problems that can’t be solved manually or through automation alone,” said Deb Roy, an associate professor at the Media Lab who will lead the Laboratory for Social Machines and who also serves as Twitter’s chief media scientist.
The goal is not just to understand how people think and use social media but also how networks can be used to increase accountability and transparency and gauge public opinion.
“With this investment, Twitter is seizing the opportunity to go deeper into research to understand the role Twitter and other platforms play in the way people communicate, the effect that rapid and fluid communication can have and apply those findings to complex societal issues,” CEO Dick Costolo said.

The 14 Best Things Happening In The World Of Dance This Fallreddit
The weather in New York City is slowly starting to change, and with the slight temperature decrease comes, among other things, a new season of dance and ballet.
Manhattan has two big ballet galas in the fall -- New York City Ballet's Fall Gala and American Ballet Theater's Opening Gala -- and we can already sense the approaching onslaught of "Nutcracker" renditions. Meanwhile, some of New York's best alternative dance institutions are pumping out ground-breaking work, among them pieces by MacArthur Genius Kyle Abraham and the renowned Martha Graham Studio Theater.
It can be tough to navigate the gated communities of dance, however. So we've put together a guide to seeing and experiencing what NYC has to offer in the upcoming months. Behold, the 14 best things happening in the world of dance this fall.
1. Kyle Abraham at New York Live Arts
Kyle Abraham and his company Abraham.In.Motion have two performances at New York Live Arts. The first, " The Watershed ," is a historical review enacted in the art of dance, referencing -- through movement -- the Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement and present day issues of freedom and emancipation. The second, " When the Wolves Came In ," gets historical too. It focuses on the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and the 20th anniversary of the abolishment of apartheid in South Africa. You've got to move fast to see these. The last performance will be held on October 4, 2014. (September 23-October 4 at New York Live Arts)
2. Wendy Whelan's Final Performance
After a 30-year career with the New York City Ballet , 47-year-old Wendy Whelan will bid farewell to audiences on October 18. The prima ballerina has plans for her post-departure period already -- she's heading to City Center as an artistic associate. There she'll continue choreographing and performing, with a program of new works with Royal Ballet dancers Edward Watson set for 2015. But before that happens, she has a little more than two weeks at NYCB. (October 18 at New York City Ballet)
3. Bill T. Jones' "Story/Time 35, 36, 37, 38 & 39"
New York Live Arts' resident dance company, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, is performing this piece from November 4-8 and 11-15, in which dance icon Bill T. Jones shares 60 one-minute stories amidst a "landscape" of dance and music. "The stories are largely autobiographical, rummaging backward and forward in time," Iris Fanger described in Arts Fuse. "As for pulling out themes from Jones’ gathering of tales, well, the bedrock of human existence seems to be very much on his mind -- life and death, landscape and memory." (November 4-8 & 11-15 at New York Live Arts)
4. Jillian Peña's "Polly Pocket: Expansion Pack"
According to a description of the work, Jillian Peña "takes inspiration from ballet, psychoanalysis, queer theory, and Marxism." In more comprehensible terms, three dancers will act out their characters' relationships to each other and themselves in a somewhat narrative look at desire, conflict and compromise. Intrigued? The dance and video artist's performance will take place from October 2-4 at Danspace Project . (October 2-4 at Danspace Project)
5. Parsons Dance at the 92nd Street Y
Want a sneak peek of the Manhattan-based Parsons Dance company's January 2015 calendar? Check out their performances at the 92nd Street Y on October 25 and 26 . The program will include a special focus on the work of Parsons Dance Generation NOW fellow Natalie Lomonte. (October 25-26 at 92nd Street Y)
7. Pilobolus at Tilles Center for the Performing Arts
Pilobolus , a Connecticut-based dance company, is named after a barnyard fungus that propels its spores with extraordinary speed. If that isn't an indication of the avant spirit of the group, founded in 1971, we don't know what is. They'll be at Tilles Center for the Performing Arts on October 17. (October 17 at Tilles Center for the Performing Arts)
8. Soledad Barrio & Noche Flamenca
"Noche Flamenca y Antigona" combines the Spanish dance tradition of flamenco with the tragic story of Sophocles' "Antigone." Need we say more? It's happening at the Joyce Theater at the end of this month and into November. (October 29-November 9 at Joyce Theater)
9. Kyla Abraham's "Pavement" at McCarter Theater
Not able to see Abraham's work at New York Live Arts? You can head to Princeton, New Jersey and see his company perform a movement-based portrait of Pittsburg , based on John Singleton’s 1991 film "Boyz N the Hood" and the writings of W.E.B. DuBois. (October 21-22 at McCarter Theater)
10. The Kathryn Posin Dance Company "Voices of Bulgaria and America"
The music for this performance at the 92nd Street Y will include Balto-Finnic, Mongolian and Russian choruses and choirs. And audiences can look forward to seeing dancers like Amar Ramasar, Boyko Dossev, Yumelia Garcia, and Megan Dickinson. (October 17-19 at the 92nd Street Y)
11. RoseAnne Spradlin's "g-h-o-s-t c-r-o-w-n"
The dancers: Natalie Green, Rebecca Warner, devynn emory, Athena Malloy and Saúl Ulerio. The live music: composer Jeffrey Young, viola player Hannah Levinson, bass clarinetist Mara Mayer and bassist Lisa Dowling. The visuals: artist Glen Fogel. The work, tentatively titled " g-h-o-s-t c-r-o-w-n ," will include improvised movements, samples of dancers' voices and electronic undertones. So, it's a must-see. (October 8-11 at New York Live Arts)
12. Martha Graham's "Appalachian Spring"
It's the 70th birthday of Martha Graham's "Appalachian Spring," which was originally created in 1944 with a commissioned score that won Aaron Copland a Pulitzer Prize . It premiered at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC on October 30. In a nice nod to history, the Martha Graham company will perform the work once again on October 30. (October 30 at the Martha Graham Studio)
13. Maya Dance Theatre of Singapore
The company, based in Singapore, is coming to the 92nd Street Y for the institutions' "Fridays at Noon" series. "Our dance vocabulary draws inspiration from Asian traditions and aesthetics," the group explains on its Facebook page . What's a better way to spend Halloween day? (October 31 at the 92nd Street Y)
14. Michal Samama at Chocolate Factory Theater
Michal Samama's " Background Materials " is more performance art, centering on the "temporal and spatial aspects of bodily experiences." So, if you're game for a moving artwork that blurs the line between theater and dance, Samama's visual exploration of the relationship between culture and materialism is your go-to show. However, you'll need to act quick. The performance will take place on October 1-4. (October 1-4 at Chocolate Factory Theater)

Australia authorises special forces troops to go to IraqAustralian PM Tony Abbott said that Islamic State is a genuine threat to Australia.
Reuters | Sydney | Posted: October 3, 2014 9:48 am
Australian special forces troops will be deployed in Iraq to assist in the fight against Islamic State militants, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Friday, and its aircraft will also join U.S.-led coalition strikes.
Abbott said in a nationally televised news conference the Australian troops would be engaged in an “advise and assist” capacity to support the Iraqi army in their battle against the militant Islamist group.
The United States has been bombing Islamic State and other groups in Syria for almost two weeks with the help of Arab allies, and hitting targets in neighbouring Iraq since August.
European countries have joined the campaign in Iraq but not in Syria.
Last month, Abbott sent aircraft and 600 personnel to the United Arab Emirates in preparation for joining the coalition. He has since said it was likely Australian aircraft would join the strikes to combat Islamic State, which he described as a “murderous death cult”.
While the involvement of Australian aircraft had been flagged, the use of Australian troops on the ground in Iraq was not as widely anticipated.
“Today, cabinet has authorised Australian air strikes in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi Government and in support of the Iraqi government,” Abbott said.
“Also, subject to final legal documentation, cabinet has authorised the deployment of Australian special forces into Iraq to advise and assist Iraqi forces.”
So far Australian aircraft have been limited to humanitarian aid and delivering arms to Iraqi government-backed forces.
Australia is on high alert for attacks by radicalised Muslims or by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, having raised its threat level to high and undertaken a series of high-profile raids in major cities.
Officials believe up to 160 Australians have been either involved in fighting in the Middle East or actively supporting groups fighting there. At least 20 are believed to have returned to Australia and have been said to pose a security risk.
One man was charged on Tuesday with funding a terrorist organisation, while another was arrested last month after police said they had thwarted a plot to behead a randomly selected member of the public.
Prominent Australian Muslims say their community is being unfairly targeted by law enforcement and threatened by right-wing groups, and there are concerns that policies aimed at combating radical Islamists could create a backlash.
Abbott said Islamic State poses a grave threat to both Australia and the wider world and that Canberra could not afford to shirk its responsibility to contribute militarily to “degrading” the group’s capabilities.
“The Americans certainly have quite a substantial special forces component on the ground already,” he said.
“My understanding is that there are U.K. and Canadian special forces already inside Iraq, so we’ll be operating on a much smaller scale but in an entirely comparable way to the United States special forces.”
The Australian contingent continued…

US lifts 40-year arms ban to boost Vietnam sea defencePrint
Agence-France Presse | Washington | Posted: October 3, 2014 3:19 pm
In a decision likely to anger China, the US is partly lifting a 40-year ban on arms sales to former foe Vietnam to help boost defences in the tense South China Sea.
The historic easing of the ban in place since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 will only apply to maritime equipment, State Department officials stressed, and comes amid warming ties and as Hanoi makes “modest” improvements to human rights.
“What’s driving this is not a sudden desire to transfer military equipment to Vietnam writ large, but a specific need in the region,” said one official, highlighting what he called Vietnam’s lack of capacity in the disputed waters and America’s own national security interests.
“It’s useful in trying to deal with the territorial disputes in the South China Sea to bolster the capacity of our friends in the region to maintain a maritime presence in some capacity.”
Some 40 per cent of the world’s seaborne trade passes through the sea which is claimed in part by Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia, as well as China and the Philippines.
Although the United States has not taken sides in the territorial disputes, it has warned Beijing against “destabilising actions” amid a series of tense maritime incidents.
Earlier this year, Beijing placed an oil rig in waters also claimed by Vietnam, sparking deadly riots in the Southeast Asian nation.
Secretary of State John Kerry informed his Vietnamese counterpart Pham Binh Min during talks Thursday of Washington’s move to adjust the current policy “to allow the transfer of defence equipment, including lethal defense equipment, for maritime security purposes only,” a senior
State Department official said.
Kerry later praised “the transformation” in Vietnam since the US normalised diplomatic relations two decades ago, calling it “nothing short of amazing.”
“Vietnam has become a modern nation and an important partner of the United States. And (when) we talk to the young people in Vietnam you can feel the enthusiasm for the potential of the future,” he told a US-ASEAN business council dinner.
A prohibition on sales of other kinds of lethal weapons, such as tanks, will stay in place as Washington pushes Hanoi to improve its human rights record.
“Vietnam will need to make additional progress on human rights for the United States to consider a full lift of the ban on lethal defence articles in the future,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

PM Modi makes radio debut  urges people to join Clean India campaignComments
In a free-wheeling chatty address to the nation, through radio, Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a clarion call to citizens to join his social initiatives and contribute to nation-building. He also promised to stay in touch and connect - at least once, if not twice, a month with citizens on radio, becoming the first Indian Prime minister to reach out to citizens on such a regular basis, directly.
Modi used his debut on radio – during a programme titiled Mann ki Baat -  to remind listeners of his Swachh Bharat, Clean India, campaign. He spoke of the nine people he had invited to join the campaign, and urged every citizen to do the same - clean up, encourage another nine people to do so, and create a movement.
Modi also promoted the use of khadi, and said he was not asking people to wear only khadi. “But even if you use one khadi product, it will light the lamp of prosperity in the house of a poor person.”
The PM peppered his speech with anecdotes which had a running theme – of motivating and energizing citizens, and recognising their inner strength. This has been a constant thread of Modi’s addresses, be it at the Independence Day or in US or during the Swachh Bharat pledge.

Modi’s emphasis has been that the country is not only that of the government, but of the people, and citizens have to step up.
“You know, our scientists have undertaken the Mars mission successfully at minimum expenses. There is nothing lacking in our capabilities. We only have forgotten our strengths. We have forgotten ourselves as if we have become despondent.
My brothers and sisters, this cannot be,” said Modi."We need to recognise our internal strengths," he added. "The 125 crore Indians are blessed with immense skill and strength. All we need to do is to understand our strengths."
Modi spoke of his engagement with specially-abled children, and how they are the responsibility of not just their parents, but of the society and the country. He also spoke of skill development, and environment.
But more than the message, the novelty on Friday was in Modi’s choice of the medium and his direct engagement.
Modi plans to make his radio speeches once or twice a month on Sunday mornings to get his message across to two-thirds of the country’s 1.2 billion people who listen regularly to the radio.
Presidents and prime ministers generally use radio to address the people on Republic Day and Independence Day, but Modi’s address is the start of a regular slot on air for the prime minister.
He addressed millions of school students across the country on state-run Doordarshan on Teachers’ Day, but radio will help him reach deeper into the country as All India Radio has a much wider reach.
To make the communication two-way, Modi added if citizens wanted to respond, they could do so over email and letters. "If you have ideas and actual incidents which are constructive, do share with me. Together let us serve India and take our nation to newer heights," Modi said.

Islamic State group downs Iraqi chopper: officialsprint
Islamic State group militants armed with a rocket launcher shot down an Iraqi military attack helicopter Friday in the country's north, authorities said, highlighting their ability attack aircraft as a US-led coalition expands its efforts to combat the extremists.
Fighters downed the Mi-35 helicopter between the towns of Beiji and al-Senniyah in northern Iraq, an official with the Iraqi Defense Ministry said. An official with the Iraqi air force corroborated the information, saying the helicopter's pilot and co-pilot were killed in the crash.
Beiji, located 200 kilometers (130 miles) north of Baghdad, is home to Iraq's biggest oil refinery.
Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak with journalists.
Militants with Islamic State group have taken over parts of western and northern Iraq this year, causing the Iraqi military to fracture while tensions intensified between Muslim sects. When fighters conquered Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, in June, the US-trained Iraqi military crumbled, and the militants seized tanks and other military equipment, helping to steamroll their onslaught.
The shoot down of the helicopter shows the Islamic State group's ability to counter air operations, potentially putting at risk US-led airstrikes in the country. US Central Command said it had carried out airstrikes in Sinjar and Fallujah over Thursday and Friday.
Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has embarked on a plan to restructure the military and vowed to create a national guard that will defend the country and protect civilians without promoting sectarianism.
Iraq's most revered Shiite cleric called on al-Abadi to create a national security force that doesn't promote sectarianism at a time of heightened tensions between ethnic and religious groups.
The national guard, proposed by al-Abadi, should be a force of "patriotism and purity" to help pull the country out of the crisis, the reclusive al-Sistani said in his Friday sermon delivered by his spokesman Abdul Mehdi Karbalaie in the city of Karbala.
There must be "careful selection with regard to sectarianism or ethnicity or national building within the national guard, so that it does not generate feelings among the enrollees that they are defending certain sects," al-Sistani said.
An Iraqi Cabinet also was selected on Sept. 8, with the exception of the key posts of the defense and interior ministers, with lawmakers failing to agree on who should be nominated. Al-Sistani called upon al-Abadi to select candidates for these critical roles following the Islamic Eid al-Adha holiday next week.

Investing.com - Investing.com - The euro dropped to 2-year lows against a surging dollar on Friday after data revealed the U.S. added far more payrolls in September than markets were expecting.
In U.S. trading, EUR/USD was down 1.22% at 1.2515, up from a session low of 1.2501 and off a high of 1.2675.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.2500, the low from Sept. 5, 2012, and resistance at 1.2716, Monday's high.
The Department of Labor reported earlier that the U.S. economy added 248,000 jobs in September, far more than the expected 215,000 increase. The number of jobs created in August was revised to 180,000 from a previous estimate of 142,000.
In addition, the U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 5.9% last month from 6.1% in August.
Analysts had expected the rate to remain unchanged, and the numbers boosted the dollar by cementing expectations for the Federal Reserve to close its monthly bond-buying program later this month and begin hiking interest rates sooner rather than later in 2015.
Elsewhere, the Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index slipped to 58.6 in September from a reading of 59.6 in August. Analysts had expected the index to fall to 58.5 last month.
A separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $40.10 billion in August from $40.30 billion in July, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated deficit of $40.60 billion.
Analysts had expected the trade deficit to widen to $40.90 billion in August.
The U.S. jobs report served as the pair's chief steering current, eclipsing otherwise cheery European data showing that euro zone retail sales rose 1.2% in August, beating expectations for an uptick of 0.1%, after 0.4% fall in July.
Year-on-year, retail sales increased by 1.9% in August, more than the expected 0.5% rise. July's figure was revised to a 0.5% gain from a previously estimated 0.8% rise.
Earlier Friday, Markit said the euro zone services PMI ticked down to 52.4 in September from 52.8 the previous month, confounding expectations for the index to remain unchanged.
Markit also reported that Germany's services PMI rose to 55.7 last month from a reading of 55.4 in August, while France's services PMI fell to 48.4 in September from 49.4 in August.
Elsewhere, the euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.10% at 0.7839, and down against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.05% at 137.30.

Investing.com - Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remained close to fresh four-year highs against a basket of other major currencies on Friday, as the release of strong U.S. employment report boosted demand for the greenback.

USD/JPY jumped 1.30% to 109.86, re-approaching six-year peaks, while USD/CHF rallied 1.42% to fresh 14-month highs at 0.9675.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD hit four-year lows and was last down 1.72% at 0.8652. NZD/USD plunged 1.87% to trade at 0.7752, while USD/CAD gained 0.91% to new six-month highs at 1.1259.
Official data showed that Canada's trade balance swung into a deficit of C$0.61 billion in August from a surplus of C$2.20 billion in July, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated surplus of C$2.58 billion.
Analysts had expected the trade surplus to narrow to C$1.50 billion in August.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped 1.30% to 86.85, the highest level since June 2010.

Kolkata: At least 13 students from various city colleges were taken into preventive detention for some time Friday for staging protests to show solidarity with Jadavpur University students who earlier subjected to an alleged police crackdown, police said.
The students had gathered around a Durga Puja marquee in Salt Lake area and were staging a street play and shouting slogans to extend support to Jadavpur students who have been demanding the removal of Vice Chancellor Abhijit Chakrabarty when they were taken into custody.
"We have taken 13 students who were staging a demonstration under preventive detention. After questioning they were released," said an officer of Bidhannagar North Police station.
At least 13 students from various city colleges were taken into preventive detention for some time Friday for staging protests to show solidarity with Jadavpur University students who earlier subjected to an alleged police crackdown, police said.

The students asserted they were demonstrating peacefully and alleged the police action on them was indicative of the administration's "growing excesses" on the students.
"We had organised a similar protest at Maddox Square Thursday and doing the same here Friday. Despite our protests being peaceful, we were taken into custody. This is reflective of the administration's bid to suppress our movement," said one of the students.
"Apprehensive of the students standing up against this government's excesses, police are being used to forcibly stifle the voices of protests," said another.
Demanding an independent probe into the alleged molestation of a female pupil, the university students Sep 16 had confined Chakrabarty in the University premises and staging protests when the alleged police crackdown took place which resulted in several of the students getting injured.
While the police and West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee have denied the students were baton charged, thousands of students, alumni and eminent personalities September 20 took out a street march demanding the VC's resignation and condemning the police crackdown.

World needs Android  Hindutva: RSS mouthpiecePrint
Written by Liz Mathew , Raghvendra Rao | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 5:50 am
What’s common between the Android operating system for mobile phones and Hindutva or Apple Inc products and Islam? Or, do Chimpanzees have anything to do with ‘love jihad’? A lot, if one were to believe some recent editorials in Panchajanya, mouthpiece of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
“The world needs ‘Android’. The world needs Hindutva,” concluded the weekly’s August 16 editorial. Drawing parallel between the apple that tempted Adam and the Apple Inc products, the article says “in this age of mobile revolution, people are continuing to fall for the ‘apple’. “However, despite its all its attraction, the ‘Apple’ has some limitations too. Other than its own ‘products’ its ‘operating system’ does not support anything else. If you have faith in ‘Apple’, then you are welcome to that limited world where partnership with the others is prohibited and is a sin,” said the edit. It went on to state that for those who follow Islam, accepting others is a crime and is unpardonable.
“Those using Androids are free to download any of the lakhs of applications as per their choice.” It is like a neighbourhood Hindu family in which an exercise-loving, gym-going youth is a worshipper of lord Hanuman while his studious, music-loving sister worships goddess Saraswati, the edit says, adding that the freedom to make one’s own choice is Hinduism’s specialty. The only reason why Android is being lapped up the world over is because it offers unlimited fre-edom to make changes, much like Hinduism, it said.
In its August 30 editorial, the RSS mouthpiece invoked English primatologist Jane Goodall and her research on Chimpanzees to explain the dynamics of ‘love jihad’.
According to the editorial, Goodall found a group of chimpanzees, which fiercely protected its territory against other groups of chimps, their males patrolled the territories to attract the females from the warring groups, with the aim of producing as many children as possible, which in turn will make their group bigger and stronger. The editorial said there are human groups who see women as only child-producing machines, and who want to establish their strength through their ability to reproduce.
Hitesh Shankar, editor of Panchajanya who writes the editorial said there was no particular intention on presenting his argument in this way. “I am a person who can stand between Androids and Ramayana and look at both things. This is my way of writing,” Shankar said. He added that he has been getting good response especially from the youth to the editorials he writes. To attract more readers the weekly has laun-ched an ad campaign.

Patna: Locals blame police as 32 killed in Dussehra stampede  high level probe ordered4
0
Patna: At least 33 people have been killed and several injured in a stampede that took place during Dusshera celebrations on Friday night. Soon after the incident, the locals blamed the district police for keeping the exits shut after the celebrations which led to the stampede.
The half-km stretch of the road from Gandhi Maidan to Exhibition Road and about same distance upto Kargil Chowk was littered with shoes, slippers and other objects abandoned by the fleeing crowd panicked by the rumours of a live overhead electricity wire falling on them.
Eyewitnesses claim that they saw people desperately jostling with each other to exit. "Only two out of the 11 gates at the sprawling maidan were kept open for the exit," an onlooker said.
#patna #patna stampede #narendra modi #jitan ram manjhi
"Panic gripped the people after some youths shouted 'bhago bhago' triggering stampede as scores of helpless women and children fell down and got trampled under the feet of crowd running for their lives. I could not rescue them, could have been women of my family and my sons/daughters," he said.
Locals also slammed the police for making inadequate security arrangements for the people, particularly for their exit saying that no cops were present on the southern side of the Gandhi Maidan to regulate traffic and movement of people. "But for inept policing, loss of large number of lives could have been prevented," he said and hinted that the toll must be much higher than being accounted by the administration.
Witnesses also say that there was little space for the people on the road as vehicles of district police and VIPs were parked on the road on South-East corner of Gandhi maidan. While scores of people ran for their life from an exit gate on way to Kargil Chowk, a large crowd tried to make way to the Exhibition road where many people, including women and children, met their tragic end.
The narrowness of space on Exhibition road due to construction of a flyover was a major reason for high number of causalities, those present testified. There was inadequate street light on South-East side of Gandhi Maidan as people ran for life and in the process fell on each other in the darkness, the eyewitnesses said.
"There was a rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over in the frenzy," Patna District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma said.
Even the situation at the Maidan later on was not found to be any better as there was total darkness in the premise after the stampede with the state government and district administration shifting their focus on the PMCH where the injured revellers have been taken for treatment and on the streets for security reasons.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday spoke to Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi to review the situation of the stampede. Singh has sought a report from the state government on the incident. A high level probe has been ordered into the incident.
The tragedy struck at around 7 PM at the South East corner of the ground near the Exhibition road when people were returning after watching the "Ravana Vadh" (killing of demon king) event and jostled with each other to move ahead, eyewitnesses and officials said.

Islamic State beheads second British aid workerThis undated image shows a frame from a video released Friday, Oct. 3, 2014, by Islamic State militants that purports to show the killing of former taxi driver Alan Henning by the militant group.
Reuters | Washington/beirut | Posted: October 4, 2014 7:54 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 10:06 am
Islamic State militants beheaded British aid worker Alan Henning in a video posted on Friday, triggering swift condemnation by the British and US governments.
The footage on YouTube, highlighted on pro-Islamic State Twitter feeds, showed a middle-aged man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling next to a black-clad militant in arid scrubland, similar to past Islamic State beheading videos of two American journalists and a British aid worker.
The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric these terrorists are. My thoughts are with his wife and their children.
— David Cameron (@David_Cameron) October 3, 2014
As in previous videos, Henning appears to read from a script before he is killed. “Because of our parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision,” he says.
Read: UK aid worker killed in third ISIS beheading
A male voice with a British accent says, “The blood of David Haines was on your hands Cameron,” in references to the slain aid worker and to Britain’s prime minister. “Alan Henning will also be slaughtered, but his blood is on the hands of the British parliament.”
Henning, a 47-year-old taxi driver from Salford in northern England, was part of an aid convoy taking medical supplies to a hospital in northwest Syria in December last year when it was stopped by gunmen and he was abducted.
In a posting on Twitter, Cameron said: “The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric these terrorists are. My thoughts are with his wife and their children.”
US officials said they had no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video, titled “Another Message to America and its Allies.”
“The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning,” President Barack Obama said in a statement.
“Standing together with our UK friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan’s murder — as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines — to justice,” Obama said, referring to other captives killed by Islamic State militants.
Near the end of the one-minute, 11-second video, the man in black introduces another hostage identified as American Peter Edward Kassig. His parents later issued a statement confirming their 26-year-old son had been taken captive while doing humanitarian work in Syria.
“We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe,” Ed and Paula Kassig of Indianapolis, Indiana, said in the statement.

WaPo: Pierson Wanted To Run Secret Service  Like Disney Worldreddit
Julia Pierson resigned as the head of the scandal-ridden Secret Service on Wednesday, but details about her shaky tenure at the agency keep emerging.
A critical new report from The Washington Post portrays Pierson as a consistent voice for a less robust security presence around President Obama and other dignitaries. One of the most damning details: Pierson, who was "irate" at what she considered excessive security measures for this summer's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, said that “We need to be more like Disney World. We need to be more friendly, inviting.” Pierson had worked as a Disney costumed character during high school.
In another instance, Pierson wanted to assign around 30 officers to patrol the perimeter of the White House, even though an internal report recommended 100.
The report also outlined the Secret Service's lack of morale and inability to "to fulfill its sacred mission."
Pierson had been hired to right the ship after an embarrassing scandal involving prostitutes on a presidential trip in Colombia. But, as the report makes clear, she failed to make a dent in the agency's "systemic problems," which range from staffing shortages to resentment over long hours. She resigned after reports that a White House intruder had gotten much further into the president's residence than the Secret Service had admitted, and that the agency had allowed an armed ex-convict onto the same elevator as Obama in September.

VW to open IT centre in Pune; to house 1000 ...Tweet
ET learns that the regional competency centre is expected to house over 1,000 engineers over the next three to four years.
MUMBAI: The 197-billion Volkswagen Group, the automobile manufacturer with 12 brands, including Audi, Lamborghini and Porsche, will open an IT development centre in Pune next month as it takes steps to secure critical technical knowledge, quicken in-house processes and cut down dependence on outsourcing.
ET learns that the regional competency centre is expected to house over 1,000 engineers over the next three to four years. Milan Kumar will head the centre in India, which will provide IT support to all its companies across the world by leveraging the talent available in the country. Global companies such as General Motors, Fiat, and Hyundai Motor Company are increasingly investing on IT and R&D resources in India.
German auto component major Bosch has a 4,000-strong IT workforce in Bangalore, which apart from working on systems and processes, handles critical development work for the group globally. Volkswagen's Pune centre will start with the IT function and may eventually expand into a bigger development role.
The group already employs over 9,000 IT professionals and another 1,000 will be added in India.
A VW India spokesperson confirmed the centre is expected to be officially inaugurated in November and will house about 500 people in the first stage. Volkswagen India's plant is located at Chakan near Pune. The centre in Hinjewadi, on the western outskirts of Pune, is a "strategic extended workbench of Volkswagen Group IT, set up with an aim to insource group processes and critical technical knowledge", said Sidharth Yadav, Regional CIO - Asia Pacific of the Volkswagen Group.
With the growing IT needs of the group, the focus will be on building highly competent IT Teams and developing in-house knowledge as a foundation for continued innovation, Kumar told ET, adding that the 'insourcing' endeavour will not take away work for outsourcers. Volkswagen has been a large customer for the Indian IT industry.
In 2009, Tata Consultancy Services bagged a five-year contract with the carmaker's UK unit. Volkswagen's US units have also worked with Infosys. The Volkswagen Group operates 106 production plants in 19 European countries and another eight countries in the Americas, Asia and Africa. It also offers a wide range of financial services.
"The problem we are facing is that a lot of knowledge has gone out to vendors and sometimes it was be coming hard for us to understand our own systems. Now, we want the knowledge of critical applications to be in-house. And security is a key focus for us. We don't want data about key Volkswagen processes to be with a vendor," Kumar said.
He defined a critical application as one that had Volkswagen-specific business processes or one that affected innovation in areas such as analytics and mobility.
"Whenever we get a new vendor onboard, there is gap in knowledge and there is an effort in training them. When we do this in-house, it will reduce the time and also we can be creative and innovate on our processes because we have an understanding of our business - say reducing the time to get material to the factory," explained Kumar.
Volkswagen's move to 'insource' work comes two years after General Motors decided to hire 10,000 IT professionals to keep work inhouse, leaving a share of just about 10% to be outsourced. In 2006, General Motors had outsourcing contracts worth about $7 billion.
Companies that have started moving work in-house include American Express, Proctor & Gamble and Bank of America.
"We don't plan to become some kind of IT company. There will still be some amount of outsourcing," Kumar said.
Gaurav Vangaal, Sr. analyst at I.H.S Automotive says India already has R&D centres in the country from global manufacturers but opening up of an IT center to support operations globally is a significant step.
"It opens up a new direction or avenue for global players to invest in India. Moreover, it's a wonderful initiative to utilize right kind of Indian potential & skills to support global operations. The move also boosts idea of Make in India or to provide work force to globe by our visionary Prime Minister," added Vangaal.

reddit
A new survey show the independent candidate leading in Kansas. A Democratic pollster defends outlier results favoring his client in Kentucky. And the AP poll says it's still the economy, stupid. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, October 2, 2014.
ORMAN LEADS IN KANSAS - HuffPollster: "A Wednesday poll conducted by Suffolk University for USA Today finds independent Greg Orman leading embattled Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), 46 percent to 41 percent, in a Kansas race that could determine control of the U.S. Senate. The results echo that of other polling conducted after Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out of the race and successfully sued to have his name removed from the ballot. A Kansas court ruled unanimously on Wednesday that Democrats don't need to field another candidate in his place. With Taylor off the ballot, theSuffolk/USA Today poll finds, 82 percent of Democrats back Orman. Independents also lean slightly toward Orman, giving him 43 percent to Roberts' 38 percent. Sixty-one percent of Republicans support Roberts, while 30 percent said they prefer Orman. As USA Today's Susan Page notes, the small cadre of voters who remain undecided or who back the libertarian, Randall Batson, split down the middle when pushed to choose between Orman and Roberts." The Pollster tracking model, whose current estimate draw mostly from polls conducted since Taylor exited the race, gives Orman a slightly narrower 3 percentage point advantage, as of this writing. [ Kansas chart , HuffPost ]
And if Orman wins? - Orman says that he will caucus with whatever party holds the majority. As of this writing, the overall Pollster forecast shows Republicans with very narrow advantages in four key Senate battlegrounds currently held by Democrats -- Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado and Iowa -- that would give them a majority of 52 Senate seats, assuming Republicans also prevail in contests where they are farther ahead. If that happens, an Orman win would simply add another seat to their majority. The current polling margins are so close, however, that the overall probability of a Republican majority stands at 58 percent as of this writing, barely better than a coin toss. And the model also sees 12 percent chance that Orman could win in a scenario where he would determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate, should Republicans win just enough contests to gain 50 seats.

Other new polls:
Wisconsin governor - The latest Marquette Law School poll found Gov. Scott Walker (R) with a 5-point lead over challenger Mary Burke (D), his best showing on a Marquette poll since they switched to a likely voter model in May. While data on the race continues to vary, the race seems unquestionably close, with no surveys since April showing a margin of more than 5 points between the two candidates. The Pollster model gives Walker a 2 point edge and a 56 percent chance of winning. [ Wisconsin chart , Marquette ]
Texas governor - A Texas Lyceum poll gave Greg Abbott (R) a 9-point lead over Wendy Davis (D), virtually unchanged from their last survey a year ago. While recent polling on the race has been relatively scarce, there's little evidence that it will be competitive, with even Davis' internal polling showing her trailing by 8 points. Other surveys have her down by double digits. The Pollster model gives Abbott a 12-point lead and a more than 93 percent chance of winning. [ Texas chart , Texas Lyceum ]
New Hampshire Senate - A new automated telephone poll by New England College showed a tie, with Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Republican challenger Scott Brown getting 47 percent each, narrowing from the seven point margin they gave Shaheen a week earlier. Recent surveys in New Hampshire have shown a closer race as Brown has gained support, although 11 of 14 polls conducted in September had Shaheen at least nominally ahead. The Pollster tracking model puts Shaheen's current lead lead at just over 3 percentage points with a 61 percent chance of prevailing in November. [ Pollster New Hampshire chart , NEC ]
Colorado Senate - Rasmussen released a poll showing Cory Gardner (R) effectively tied with Sen. Mark Udall (D), 48 percent to 47 percent. While the past five surveys of the race all give Gardner at least a marginal edge, they differ on the size -- Suffolk/USA also found Gardner up 1 and a sponsored PPP (D) poll had him up 2, while polls by Quinnipiac and Gravis Marketing had the Republican ahead by 8 and 7 points, respectively. The Pollster model gives Gardner an edge of just over 1 point, and a 55 percent chance of winning the race. [ Colorado chart , Rasmussen ]
Kentucky Senate - The campaign of Democratic Senate challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes released an internal poll Wednesday showing her with a 2-percentage point edge over Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell (42 to 40 percent). The survey of 1,800 likely voters, which sampled from official registration lists, was conducted by pollster Mark Mellman. With the exception of another Grimes internal poll fielded by Mellman in early September, every other publicly released poll on the Kentucky Senate race since late July has shown McConnell leading by margins ranging from 2 to 10 percent. The current Pollster average, which places lesser weight on polls with partisan sponsorship, gives McConnell a lead of roughly five percentage points (48.0 to 43.1 percent as of this writing) and a 67 percent chance of winning in November. [ Kentucky chart , Politico , Mellman memo ]
How credible? - Given the contrast with other public data, and the record of selective release of internal polling that shows a consistent bias favoring sponsoring candidate, some rolled their eyes. "I am 6'7" and can dunk, according to an internal poll I conducted," tweeted Scott Conroy of RealClearPolitics. Mellman's recent record, however, should at least give observers pause. His internal polls for Sen. Harry Reid in Nevada in 2010 showed him leading a race he would go on to win while nearly all public polls showed the Majority leader trailing. Something similar transpired in North Dakota in 2012, when publicly released Mellman polls showed client Heidi Heitkamp leading the race she would win narrowly, while well known public polls showed her trailing by 2 to 10 percentage points. [ @RealClearScott , See also [ HuffPost on Nevada 2010 ], North Dakota 2012 chart ]
Big undecided? - Even some Democratic partisans saw a flaw in the large number of undecided voters (16 percent) in Mellman's survey, compared to other public polls that have the number in single digits. "[T]here are a ton of undecideds," wrote DailyKos' David Nir, "which are likely to be the death knell of a Democrat seeking federal office in dark red Kentucky." [ DailyKos ]
Mellman rejects that argument, telling HuffPollster on Thursday, "The undecideds are in no way disproportionately Republican." He also defended the seemingly high undecided percentage via email as "not really a lot given that over the years 10-15% make up their minds on president in last week....and given the nature of this race....Well known disliked incumbent who people don't want to vote for and less well known challenger who people are just getting to know."
ECONOMY REMAINS TOP ISSUE - Jennifer Agiesta: "It's not Obamacare or climate change. It's not yet terrorism or fear of the Islamic State group. Those issues are on the minds of voters as they begin casting ballots in this year's midterm elections, but nothing matters to American voters as much the economy. In a new Associated Press-GfK poll released Wednesday, 9 in 10 of those most likely to go to the polls or mail in a ballot in this year's midterm elections call the economy an extremely or very important issue….Few see change coming once voting closes Nov. 4. A majority of likely voters, 52 percent, expect the Democratic Party to retain control of the Senate, with 68 percent saying the GOP will keep the House….In their own districts, those surveyed are evenly split: 33 percent back a Democratic candidate, 33 percent a Republican, 10 percent another candidate and 23 percent are undecided." [ AP ]
MANY WORRY AIRSTRIKES AGAINST ISIS NOT ENOUGH - Dana Blanton: "The country decisively endorses the military action being taken against ISIS: a large 78-percent majority approves of U.S. airstrikes. That includes more than 7 in 10 independents and Democrats, and more than 8 in 10 Republicans….At the same time, more than twice as many voters believe defeating ISIS will take ground troops as opposed to airstrikes alone (57-24 percent). The number saying it will require combat troops is up six percentage points from 51 percent earlier this month (September 7-9). Moreover, by a 52-42 percent margin, voters favor adding ground troops if airstrikes aren’t enough to defeat ISIS." [ Fox ]
Another poll finds similar results, but less support for ground troops - Kathy Frankovic: "The latest Economist/YouGov Poll finds support for air strikes against ISIS wherever they are aimed: within the boundaries or Iraq or within Syria. This is something for which there is bipartisan support. Although in recent years Republicans have taken the lead in favoring some military interventions, Americans of both parties have been in favor when it comes to these particular air strikes. But Americans are not at all sure those air strikes will work. They continue to oppose sending ground troops into Iraq and Syria, but many aren’t sure that air strikes alone will be effective in fighting ISIS….Just about half of those who now oppose sending in ground troops leave the door open to the possibility, agreeing that the United States should 'keep the option open.'...The president has made some gains – at least when it comes to his handling of Iraq. At 44%, approval is at the highest level since YouGov returned to asking the question this summer." [ YouGov ]

Citing technical challenges, Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association urges Trai to recalibrate green targets
Muntazir Abbas, ET Bureau Oct 4, 2014, 06.36AM IST

(Telecom infrastructure…)
NEW DELHI: Telecom infrastructure lobby group TAIPA has urged the telecom regulator to revise its Go Green targets as there were technical and operational challenges, apart from which it would require a massive capital investment of Rs 66,000 crore by 2020.
Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA), that has tower firms such as GTL, ATC, Viom and Bharti Infratel on board, said that there was a visible absence of ecosystem for telecom grade reliable renewable energy technologies or solar solution providers currently. "Besides considering technical and operational challenges, other major hurdle is arranging capital investment which stands out to be gigantic Rs 66,000 crore by 2020 to meet the target," Tilak Raj Dua, senior director general at TAIPA, told ET.
The finances become unviable for an industry already reeling under a debt burden of over Rs 2 lakh crore. 'Go green' has been a popular theme in government circles, especially after DoT unveiled stiff green targets for telcos more than two years ago.
The green telecom policy requires mobile operators to reduce diesel consumption and run 50% of their towers in rural areas and 20% in urban areas on hybrid power by next year. And by 2020, will need to run 75% and 33% of their towers in rural and urban zones, respectively, on hybrid supplies, which have been defined as a mix of grid power and renewable energy based on solar, wind, biomass or fuel cells.
But telco appetite for green energy technologies remains low, given the huge capex required to set up solar energy capacity. As a result, DoT has lately been pressing the finance ministry to provide viability gap funding (VGF) to telecom operators and tower companies to help them meet their green energy targets mandated by the government.
As a result, barely 1% of India's near 5 lakh telecom towers run on green energy solutions now. Taipa said that the telecom sector's targets for carbon emission reduction should be unique to Indian conditions and the current Green targets should be recalibrated. Viability gap funding, Dua reiterated, would be needed for solar technology to succeed in telecom applications, and added that other feasible energy sources were being explored by the telecom industry that include battery technologies which would alienate the use of diesel at sites.
TAIPA feels the sector is being unfairly targeted especially when the total diesel consumption by the telecom industry was just 1.5% vis-a-vis other sectors such as heavy and light commercial vehicles contributing 28.25%, with private car and utility vehicle's share at 22.09%. Of late, the telecom industry has undertaken many voluntary initiatives for carbon footprint reduction through sharing of towers, outdoor sites, free cooling units, and implementation of long-life batteries and distributed antennae systems.
The sectoral body will also be conducting a workshop with the ecosystem players and put on Green solutions available currently on the table and discuss the future roadmap. Earlier, the GSM lobby group COAI and TAIPA had jointly sought telecom department's intervention to put the Green targets in abeyance till the formation of detailed project report and asked to consider the industry's operational constraints

Investing.com - Investing.com - U.S. stocks rallied on Friday after a better-than-expected September jobs report fueled hopes that a more robust economy will fuel more business for corporate America.

1. RSS chief on DD
As the Congress and other opposition parties stepped up the attack on Doordarshan (DD) for broadcasting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Vijayadashami address, Prakash Javadekar strongly backed the public broadcaster and asked the Congress why it had “imposed a blanket ban on telecast of RSS rallies for the past five decades”.

(As the growth of the United…)
by Binyamin Appelbaum, Jack Ewing & Neil Gough
WASHINGTON: As the growth of the United States economy outstrips the rest of the developed world, US policymakers are allowing Europe, Japan and even China to seek a little more prosperity — at the expense of Americans. The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve have watched quietly in recent years as foreign governments and central banks have chipped away at the dollar value of their currencies, strengthening their export industries in the hope of stimulating their economies. The trend is likely to intensify over the next year as the Fed retreats from its own stimulus campaign while the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan expand their efforts. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, said on Thursday it would begin a new round of bond purchases this month.
The US has long argued that markets should determine the value of currencies and criticised nations that try to manipulate exchange rates. The current silence reflects both the simple reality that the US economy needs less help than the rest of the developed world and the judgment of officials that the United States would benefit greatly from stronger global growth. That, they say, would be true even if, in the short term, it makes the country's goods a little harder to sell and jobs a little harder to find.
"You're seeing American officials turn a blind eye to Mario Draghi talking down the euro, and turn a blind eye to interventions by the Chinese, because in both cases they're making the judgment that having a stabilised situation and decent growth prospects in these countries is far more important," said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "I tend to agree with that."
US leaders have embraced and celebrated a strong dollar as evidence of a strong economy. It lets Americans buy more foreign goods and borrow more cheaply from foreign countries. It also may draw foreign investors to US financial markets, supporting the rise of asset prices. But the rise of the dollar carries large risks, too. It makes it harder for US companies to sell goods and services. It may be contributing to the sluggish pace of domestic inflation. And some economists warn that letting the dollar rise is not a sustainable method of encouraging growth.
The ECB still has not fully deployed the arsenal of a modern central bank to improve growth in Europe. It has refrained from the large-scale purchases of government debt undertaken by the Fed, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England. But in recent months it has sought to push down the value of the euro through a variety of measures. In September, the ECB offered loans that were practically interest-free to commercial banks that promised to lend the money to businesses and consumers.
On Thursday, after a board meeting Naples, Italy, the central bank outlined a two-year plan to buy private sector assets, including bank loans packaged into securities. "These purchases will have a sizeable impact," Draghi said at a news conference after the meeting.
So far, US officials primarily seem frustrated that the European Central Bank continues to act slowly. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, last year became the rare official to call publicly for stronger action when he told an audience in Frankfurt, Germany, that the ECB should buy government bonds.
Another question is whether the programmes will provide a sufficient jolt. A similar lending programme started by the Bank of England in 2012 has not reversed the decline in small-business lending in that country. "Nobody's hiring, nobody's investing, nobody's spending," said Stefano Micossi, the director general of Assonime, an Italian business group. "There is no demand for credit. The system is not constrained by the funding side. The banks are awash in liquidity."
Japan, which has been grappling with the problems confronting Europe for more than two decades, is also seeking growth through currency moves. Under the "Abenomics" stimulus campaign that prime minister Shinzo Abe began in early 2013, the Bank of Japan has agreed to double the money supply, and the price of yen in dollars has dropped by about 24%. The results have not met expectations. Japan's trade deficit has increased while inflation remains weak. The Japanese economy shrank by 7.1% in the second quarter after a sales tax increase.
China's economic rise was built on the suppression of its currency to support cheap exports at the expense of domestic consumption. Then, beginning in 2010, the People's Bank of China let the renminbi rise about 20% against the dollar as part of its effort to encourage a transition away from export-led growth. But this year, with the economy growing at the slowest pace in more than a decade, China once again pressed down on the renminbi. Its value has fallen about 2% against the dollar so far this year. "It was a way to stimulate the economy without resorting to full blown credit and investmentdriven stimulus," said Diana Choyleva , the head of macroeconomic research at Lombard Street Research in London.
While that small change has prompted little criticism from the United States, the looming question is whether China will continue.

US health officials identify 10 people at high risk to Ebola virusPress Trust of India | Houston | Posted: October 4, 2014 9:34 am
US health officials were monitoring 50 people for Ebola exposure, 10 of whom are at “high risk” of the disease after coming in close contact with the first diagnosed American patient.
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified 10 people who had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, America’s first diagnosed case of Ebola.
CDC made contact with about 100 people that had possible contact with Duncan, and narrowed to 50 the list of people it needs to monitor daily.
The agency will continue to monitor all 50 of them for the full 21-day incubation period of the virus and see if they develop symptoms such as fever, aches, vomiting or diarrhoea.
The CDC said none of the people under observation are currently sick.
Late on Friday, four family members related to the Dallas Ebola patient were removed from their apartment, according to City of Dallas spokesperson Sana Syed.
Cleanup effort is still ongoing. The family members are asymptomatic. Daily monitoring includes a temperature reading twice a day.
The CDC has 10 disease control experts on the ground in Dallas in response to Duncan’s Ebola diagnosis, confirmed Tuesday.
Texas Commissioner of Health David Lakey would not release a specific numeric breakdown of the individuals, other than saying three of the 50 individuals are EMT workers.
Some of the individuals are those who didn’t have face to face contact with Duncan, but handled his blood for lab work at the hospital.
The others are people who had contact with Duncan in the community. The health care workers classified as “high risk” have been furloughed from work with pay.
The Ebola outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people, mostly in Africa, the World Health Organisation said Friday.

Islamic State beheads second British aid worker  releases videoThis undated image shows a frame from a video released Friday, Oct. 3, 2014, by Islamic State militants that purports to show the killing of former taxi driver Alan Henning by the militant group.
Reuters | Washington/beirut | Posted: October 4, 2014 7:54 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 10:06 am
Islamic State militants beheaded British aid worker Alan Henning in a video posted on Friday, triggering swift condemnation by the British and US governments.
The footage on YouTube, highlighted on pro-Islamic State Twitter feeds, showed a middle-aged man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling next to a black-clad militant in arid scrubland, similar to past Islamic State beheading videos of two American journalists and a British aid worker.
The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric these terrorists are. My thoughts are with his wife and their children.
— David Cameron (@David_Cameron) October 3, 2014
As in previous videos, Henning appears to read from a script before he is killed. “Because of our parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision,” he says.
Read: UK aid worker killed in third ISIS beheading
A male voice with a British accent says, “The blood of David Haines was on your hands Cameron,” in references to the slain aid worker and to Britain’s prime minister. “Alan Henning will also be slaughtered, but his blood is on the hands of the British parliament.”
Henning, a 47-year-old taxi driver from Salford in northern England, was part of an aid convoy taking medical supplies to a hospital in northwest Syria in December last year when it was stopped by gunmen and he was abducted.
In a posting on Twitter, Cameron said: “The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric these terrorists are. My thoughts are with his wife and their children.”
US officials said they had no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video, titled “Another Message to America and its Allies.”
“The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning,” President Barack Obama said in a statement.
“Standing together with our UK friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan’s murder — as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines — to justice,” Obama said, referring to other captives killed by Islamic State militants.
Near the end of the one-minute, 11-second video, the man in black introduces another hostage identified as American Peter Edward Kassig. His parents later issued a statement confirming their 26-year-old son had been taken captive while doing humanitarian work in Syria.
“We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe,” Ed and Paula Kassig of Indianapolis, Indiana, said in the statement.

Big business houses clash with early movers to hire senior leadersBig business houses clash with early movers to hire senior leaders

(Some such firms now have…)
MUMBAI: The war for talent in the e-commerce space is turning fierce as a bunch of large business houses including Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla, Tata, Future Group and Arvind Retail are now clashing with early movers like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Jabong to hire scarce managers.
Reliance Industries, which has significantly stepped up hiring in this space in the past 3-4 months, is wooing managers for business and functional head roles, offering candidates 60%-70% increases over their current pay, according to a top head hunter. Packages for most of these posts are easily crossing the Rs 1-crore mark, sources said. "Among other e-commerce companies, Reliance is talking to some key people in Jabong," the head hunter claimed. Reliance did not respond to an email query.
"We will be introducing more incentives to ensure longevity of senior employees given the heat in the sector," Praveen Sinha, cofounder and MD of Jabong said. Jabong also has over 10 open positions at the senior leadership level.
Compensation packages are frequently breaching the Rs 1 crore mark, with Rs 6 croreplus on offer at the seniormost levels. 50% to 70% pay increases are common for lateral movements, Anuj Roy, partner, digital practice at executive search firm Transearch, said.
Digital marketing heads are getting paid around Rs 50 lakh to Rs 60 lakh; category heads about Rs 70 lakh to Rs 80 lakh; operations/supply chain heads anywhere between Rs 60 lakh and Rs 1 crore and much more at the CTO/CEO levels, according to Kris Lakshmikanth, chief executive of The Head Hunters (India). "I have a mandate from a large group that is ready to pay Rs 8 crore to Rs 10 crore for a CEO position and Rs 5 crore to Rs 6 crore for a CTO," he added.
Sanjay Baweja, who will soon join as CFO Flipkart from Tata Communications is reportedly being paid Rs 4 crore and a Rs 2 crore joining bonus plus a milestone-linked equity bonus, according to a head hunter. Smaller startups and brands like Anita Dongre, Chumbak and W, which are also looking to hire managers for their e-commerce ventures, are adding to the hiring frenzy.
The demand for experienced hands to steer growth in India's booming online industry has grown multi-fold over the last few months, according to officials at search firms including the likes of Korn/Ferry International, The Head Hunters (India), EMA Partners and Transearch.
Some such firms now have special verticals to service talent needs in the e-commerce space, and are also regularly travelling abroad to meet potential hires.
As reported by ET, the Tata Group is planning an entry into the ecommerce space with the marketplace model; in the Aditya Birla Group, Prashant Gupta, who heads the chairman's office, is leading a new project to prepare the groundwork for the group's foray into e-commerce; RIL is gearing up to extend its retail business into e-commerce with a Mumbai grocery venture by this year-end, gradually extending into consumer electronics and finally its own marketplace model by next fiscal.
The talent war between early movers in the ecommerce space and business groups starting online ventures now is also spilling over to FMCG and telecom companies.
How they pay
Interesting differences are beginning to emerge in the compensation strategies of the two kinds of companies.
The early movers tend to pay a large part of senior executives' compensation in stocks, but large business groups prefer paying more cash. "The large groups getting into e-commerce have deep pockets but are not interested in giving stocks. They want to build scale, and are open to hiring from abroad," Lakshmikanth, chief executive of The Head Hunters (India) said.
  "For senior hires, many leading e-commerce companies pay about a crore in terms of the cash component, while the additional stock component would easily be three times that," Avdesh Mittal, senior client partner and regional market leader, digital media at Korn/Ferry International, said. He has handled searches for some of the e-commerce biggies. Snapdeal is in the market to hire as many as 20-25 senior people and, in some cases, will offer stocks and cash in a roughly 50:50 ratio, Saurabh Nigam, its VP- HR said.
"At a classical e-commerce firm, top-level compensation is mostly long-term incentive driven. However, a bigger conglomerate would make competitive cash offers," Anandorup Ghose, Rewards Consulting Practice Leader at Aon Hewitt India said.
Business houses also offer other unique propositions. The Future Group, which is now hiring at the CXO level for its e-commerce play, is offering professionals a chance to work in an 'omni-channel' environment, where digital and physical will merge together. "A large company with a proven presence will have a better connect and better power to attract people," Kaustubh Sonalkar, chief people officer, Future Group said.

Shares of  Jet Airways and  SpiceJet are celebrating with 5-6 percent gains intraday after price aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel was reduced by a steep 3 percent on the back of falling international oil rates. This spells good news just ahead of the long weekends and year-end festive season.
This is the third reduction in jet fuel rates since July. Declining international oil prices have made imports cheaper, resulting in price reduction. Jet fuel price was slashed by Rs 2077.62 per kilo-litre, or 2.98 percent in Delhi to Rs  67,525.63 per kl.
In Mumbai, jet fuel costs Rs 69,610.50 per kl as against Rs. 71,829.42 per kl earlier, IOC said. The rates vary because of differences in local sales tax or VAT.
Jet fuel constitutes over 40 percent of airlines' operating costs and the price cut will ease the financial burden of cash-strapped carriers.
However, if you are passengers will have to wait a little long to know if ATF price cut will lower air fares.
At 13:01 hrs Jet Airways was at Rs 212.50, up Rs 4.35, or 2.09 percent and SpiceJet was at Rs 12.48, up Rs 0.16, or 1.30 percent on the BSE.

CBI Director defends filing separate affidavits in 2G caseCBI chief Ranjit Sinha defends filing separate affidavits in 2G case
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 2, 2014  | 16:00 IST
CBI Director Ranjit Sinha
Central Bureau of Investigation Director Ranjit Sinha has vigorously defended his decision to file separate individual counter-affidavits before the Supreme Court in petitions filed by the six accused seeking quashing of charges in the 2G spectrum scam .
Sinha came out with his defence after the then Special Public Prosecutor UU Lalit, now appointed as judge of Supreme Court, raised objections to these affidavits.
"No time is appropriate to bring the truth before the Supreme Court," Sinha said in a strong observation made in an internal note on the questions raised by Lalit over the matter being reconsidered by the CBI Chief and individual affidavits being filed after a consolidated reply was given earlier.
"This case (2G) was investigated and chargesheets were filed before I took over the office," he added.
Sinha said that while the trial before the special CBI court was underway, the chargesheeted accused in the case had filed writ petitions before the Supreme court which issued notice to the CBI for filing a response.
"A consolidated reply, which was not approved by me as I was on tour, was prepared and filed by the CBI on 04.03.2014 before the Supreme Court.
Later, when the concerned file was put up to me for perusal and post facto approval, I had the occasion to examine the matter at length and while going through the case records, I came across certain facts which were probably not addressed properly during the course of investigation," Sinha said.
Sinha said that consequently he had made "certain queries and after obtaining the necessary clarifications, I was of the view that it was necessary to file separate individual counter affidavits."
The CBI chief reasoned that the case of each of the petitioners stood on different footing and complete facts and that circumstances must be brought before the apex court.
DMK leader Kanimozhi, Gautam Doshi, Hari Nair and Surendra Pipara of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, Shahid Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables had filed separate petitions in the Supreme Court seeking quashing of all charges made by the CBI against them.
The CBI Director wanted to reply to each affidavit separately and also bring to the notice of the Supreme Court about an opinion of the Law Ministry whereby it was stated that no case was made against Reliance as they had no cross holding of shares in Swan telecom.
The proposal was shot down by Lalit who posed questions to the Director as to under whose authority can the matter be attempted to be reconsidered; Which provision of law empowers such reconsideration at this stage; Once the chargesheet has been filed, will it be right for the Director of CBI to reconsider the matter and will such an act not impinge upon the independence of the investigating officer as bestowed upon him by the Code of Criminal Procedure?
"When the individual draft affidavits were put up to the undersigned (Sinha), it was ordered that the noting of the undersigned in the case file should be incorporated in the replies so that the full facts and circumstances, as available in the records, were placed before the Supreme Court.
"Needless to say, it is my duty to bring those aspects to the knowledge of the Supreme Court to ensure that full facts were placed on record and miscarriage of justice is avoided," he said in the internal file noting on Lalit's observations.
Defending his authority, Sinha said "as Director CBI, it is incumbent upon me to ensure that the investigation carried out by CBI is fair and free from bias, including the bias of public perception. Moreover, any relevant fact that comes to my notice even after the charge-sheet has been filed, and which may have bearing on the outcome of the case and which requires reconsideration can be looked into by me or any other officer of the CBI in the interest of justice."
He said the paramount duty of the CBI was not to seek acquittal or conviction of a person but to bring full facts and circumstances before the court "as and when such facts come to my knowledge".
"As this case is being monitored by the Supreme Court, failure to bring these facts and circumstances to the attention of the Supreme Court, even at this belated stage, would tantamount to dereliction of duties. Therefore, as Director, I am authorised and duty bound to take all actions within the bounds of the Constitution and the CBI (crime) manual."
Sinha said his action would in no way impinge upon the independence of the investigating officer because the final authority in matters of investigation rests with the Director CBI .
"Bringing the truth to the fore, however bitter it may be, can in no way be construed as impinging upon the independence of the investigating officer as contained in the Criminal Procedure Code," Sinha said in his noting.
Putting to rest the matter after Lalit's observations, Sinha said "the (then) special PP, however, has not opined whether the facts contained in the draft counter- affidavits are relevant or otherwise. Instead, issues have been raised which affect the basic functioning of CBI and the authority of the director.
"But that as it may, since he has directed CBI not to file any affidavit with facts which may affect the case in a fundamental way, we may not agitate the issue any further at the moment. We may consider raking up this matter in the interest of justice when the new special PP is appointed by the Supreme Court shortly."

Deepening relationship
heads of state
The fact that India and the US issued a vision document, Modi and Obama penned a joint op-ed, and then a comprehensive Joint Statement, speaks volumes for the breadth of discussions between them.
After a hectic, often frenetic five days in the United States, it is time to take stock of the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit. To begin with, the welcome he received, both in New York and in Washington, has firmly closed the door on a most awkward situation in bilateral ties: that of India voting in a leader proscribed by the U.S. Mr. Modi has been received at every level in the U.S., and if the Obama administration didn’t revoke the visa order, the gesture of President Obama right at the end to accompany Mr. Modi to the Martin Luther King Memorial came as a poignant signal that the U.S. genuinely wants to move ahead with India’s newly elected leader. Secondly, U.S. business, clearly disaffected by the difficulties they face in doing business with India, have also signalled its desire to renew investments. The fact that the two countries issued a vision document, the two leaders penned a joint op-ed, and then came out with a comprehensive 3,500-word Joint Statement, speaks volumes for the breadth of discussions between them in a short period. Yet, while the three documents contain all the parts of the relationship, they fail to convey the whole.
On issues where the countries agree, such as defence and energy, they show only incremental progress, without any big announcements. On issues where the countries differ, like the nuclear deal, trade and WTO, they seem to have deferred negotiations, indicating that no progress was made in resolving them. In that context, even the renewal of the strategic partnership, and reference to “joint and concerted efforts” to dismantle terror groups including al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, the D-Company, and the Haqqanis” do not indicate any particularly new action or formulation. The statements seem most opaque when it comes to spelling out a shared worldview for India and the U.S.: while referring obliquely to China’s aggression in the South China Sea, ‘global crises’ like the situations in Iraq and Syria, and cooperation in Afghanistan, and a confounding, long reference to North Korea (DPRK), they list no action or step that the two countries hope to take together. And while both sides made it clear ahead of the talks that the U.S. would request, and India would discuss, the possibility of joining the anti-ISIS coalition, there is silence on where those discussions led. On all fronts of the ‘comprehensive dialogue’, that is, eight issues including energy, health, space, women’s empowerment, trade, skills, strategy and security, Mr. Modi’s visit successfully brought India-U.S. ties, that were faltering for a few years, back on track. But in order to reach the finish line, Mr. Modi and Mr. Obama will need a clearer enunciation of their shared vision for the road ahead.

Electronics retail chains are selling some phones cheaper online than store priceElectronics retail chains like The Mobile Store and UniverCell are selling some phones cheaper online than store price

( Chains such as The Mobile…)
KOLKATA: If you can't beat them, join them. India's top brick-and mortar electronics retail chains , which have stoutly resisted giving discounts in their online ventures, have seen their resolve crumble and have had to change tack, in some instances matching prices with the big three e-commerce marketplaces — Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal.
According to top industry executives, chains such as The Mobile Store , UniverCell and Sangeetha Mobiles, have started to offer devices online at prices that are up to 7% lower for some models than what's on the sticker at real-world stores.
Some like Croma have been partnering with Amazon and Snapdeal, where products are offered at a discount. For instance, while a 16GB iPhone 5s sells at Rs 44,500 in retail chains, it's available on Amazon from Croma at Rs 38,999. The Nokia Lumia 520 is sold at UniverCell's own e-store at Rs 6,499,lower even than the Flipkart price of Rs 6,999.
The BlackBerry Z3 sells for Rs 15,200 at offline stores while on the The MobileStore's estore it costs Rs 14,595, matching the price on Flipkart. The discounts available at ecommerce sites are driven by the online marketplaces themselves by way of reducing their own margins, said Ajit Joshi, managing director and CEO of Infiniti Retail, the holding company of the Croma chain. "
"While we always strive to have the same promotions on our e-commerce site and stores, we do customise a few products and offer to make them more relevant for online, based on the purchase pattern of our customers," Joshi said. UniverCell Telecommunications founder D Sathish Babu said the retailer plans to offer the best online price on some specific models.
"This strategy will help to acquire and retain customers, since customers who go online invariably look for the best price and discounting," said Babu. At the same time, four of South India's top cellphone retail hains — UniverCell, Sangeetha Mobile, Poorvika Mobiles and Big C Mobiles — which together run more than 1,200 stores have teamed up to negotiate with cellphone brands to launch exclusive models such as the Google One handsets and Samsung's Galaxy S5 Mini that are only available online.
"We have together approached brands like Samsung and Micromax to launch exclusive models for us. Since the business in the store and walk-ins have come down, we have to develop our online business or be left brooding about it later," said Sangeetha Mobiles managing director Subhash Chandra.
"In a way, it's a Catch-22 situation. Either we are left out or we too join the e-commerce bandwagon," Chandra said. Last month, the Sangeetha Mobiles online venture Shopno47. com and Viveks Retail announced partnerships with eBay India. More such deals are in the pipeline, industry officials said.
A senior executive with a retail chain said that while brickand-mortar retailers were not making much profit and even selling at breakeven prices online, they earn money by picking up more inventory from the brands where the margins are 2-4% more.
"Our online prices may not always be the lowest, but still the gap is getting bridged since there is no point losing business," the executive said.
"The brands sometimes make an issue about such discounting, but we show them how such low pricing is the market-operating price in online portals," the executive said. Electronics retailers were the first to flag the issue of online discounting and have been in talks with manufacturers since last year to offer higher margins to sell at such prices in their physical and online stores. While most manufacturers have declined to offer extra margins, some of the newer, struggling brands are open to such deals on certain models. However, brands such as Samsung have taken a strong stand and started to curb supplies to sellers who are not maintaining company pricing.

How Kochi innovator Arvind Sanjeev saved you Rs 1 lakhHow Kochi innovator Arvind Sanjeev saved you Rs 1 lakh

Google Glass costs Rs 1 lakh, however, the SmartCap in vented by Kochi-based innovator Arvind Sanjeev costs just Rs 4,500. His invention has inspired cheaper Glass versions.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
When Arvind Sanjeev was 10 years old, he took apart his new gift, a remote-controlled toy Ferrari. It exasperated his parents, Central Industrial Security Force scientists, Dr Sanjeev and his wife Usha.
But there were other signs that Arvind was going to become an inventor — visitors watched in awe as a hovercraft the schoolboy built during a local electronics exhibition took to the skies. Arvind's insatiable curiosity is still alive at 23.
It propelled the Kochi-based inventor to build his own version of the cutting-edge Google Glass — a head-mounted device that mimics its famous counterpart's specifics like first person video streaming and voice recognition.
Arvind's SmartCap is a rough-around-the-edges, do-it-yourself (DIY) project, but it took him just two weeks to build and cost him — wait for it — Rs 4,500.
How it all began
Arvind says that from the moment he first saw an advert for Google Glass, he was "pumped". He runs DIY Hacking, an initiative in Kochi that tutors students on hardware technology, egging them on to tinker with electronics and build their own cool robotics projects.
He was able to lay hands on Google Glass earlier this year during a trip to the Silicon Valley. What he loved about the groundbreaking spectacles was its sleek design. What he didn't care for was its price tag, close to Rs 1 lakh.
"The Glass had innovative ideas, but its price wasn't appealing," says Arvind. And so, he worked on the SmartCap, a DIY tutorial to encourage students to make their own head-mounted devices, using open source technology like arduino and Raspberry pi.
Among other electronics, Arvind attached a web-camera, hands-free tech and LCD display with some Fevicol glue onto his old hip-hop cap. Voila, virtual reality, like the original Google Glass. "The components are bulky, so I used a hat instead of spectacles," he says. It charges with an adaptor or cellphone battery.
Why do-it-yourself
Arvind's SmartCap fired up friends to come up with their own versions. One cap had an e-reader attached, while another was a unique auto-security system. "The wearer can gauge if the driver of his car is falling asleep at the wheel," he says.
SmartCap isn't for sale though. "I registered the prototype, but only developed my own version of Google Glass to motivate students to invent projects."
It's part of his website initiative DIY Hacking, which he started while still studying his bachelors in Electronics and Communications from TocH Institute of Science and Technology in Kochi. Arvind graduated in 2013, even while simultaneously being CEO and chief inventor of his company ARS Devices.
New ways of learning
The young inventor is faintly critical of how our education system encourages innovation. "I just passed through school. I was never an outstanding student. Our education system is outdated. DIY Hacking is a more pragmatic approach to education," he says.
Apart from authoring an e-book that collates a step-by-step guide on how to make 10 projects of head-mounted displays, home automation and connected devices, Arvind also gives lectures at colleges on rapid prototyping and hardware tech.
What keeps him going? "What I enjoy most is the process of making something. Adding things part by part, usually after sleepless nights, then experiencing the final version. That's truly sublime."

Actress Twinkle Khanna has filed a case against a Noida-based real estate firm Supertech Limited in the Bombay High Court for the recovery of Rs 1.04 crore, which she claims is due to her under the Celebrity Engagement Contract.
Khanna was signed as an endorser two years ago for the developer's much talked about ORB project in Noida, three circular, 45-storey towers of luxury residences.
According to the plaintiff, filed by the actress through her lawyers, a copy of which is with ETPanache, Khanna had agreed to make herself available for not more than six days to render her services to the real estate firm, for which a payment of Rs 2.45 crore was to be made in eight instalments.
Things went as planned for the first five instalments. The plaintiff says that Khanna made herself available for three days and the real estate firm paid her a sum of Rs 1.64 crore.
However, "on 30th November, 2013, a sum of Rs 27,00,000/-( Rupees Twenty Seven Lakhs only) plus applicable service tax became due and payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. However the Defendant failed and neglected to pay the same to the Plaintiff and committed breach," says the complaint.
Khanna is currently out of India but when contacted, asked to speak to her lawyer. Her lawyer Bheru Choudhary of IC Legal refused to comment and Supertech Limited had not responded to the email query by ETPanache till the time of going to the press.

Global economy is at inflection point: IMFGlobal economy is at inflection point, says IMF chief Christine Lagarde

International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde said on Thursday that the global economy was at an inflection point with weaker than expected recovery momentum, as she called for bolder policies and multilateral efforts to inject new impetus.
Speaking at the IMF-World Bank annual meeting in Georgetown University, Lagarde said the global economy was weaker than envisaged and only a modest pickup was foreseen for 2015, as the outlook for potential growth had been pared down, Xinhua reported.
Among advanced economies, the rebound was expected to be strongest in the US and Britain; modest in Japan; and weakest in the Euro area, the managing director of the IMF noted.
Emerging market and developing economies led by Asia and China will continue to drive global activity, however, to be at a slower pace than before, she said.
"Six years after the financial crisis began, we see continued weakness in the global economy," she added.
She pointed out that there was a cloud hovering around asynchronous monetary policy normalisation in advanced economies and its potential spillovers to other countries around the world, urging the Federal Reserve to clearly communicate with the market over the exit from the monetary easing.
She also underlined the rising geographical tensions posing risks to the global economy, as a possible further escalation of the situation in Ukraine could provoke disruptions in commodity prices, financial markets and trade. An expansion of the Ebola outbreak in Africa could pose a significant risk to the region and indeed the world, if not urgently and appropriately addressed.
"That brings me to the 'structural reforms' that are so essential to raise productivity, competitiveness and employment," she said.
The Washington-based organisation is expected to lower its projection of global economic growth for 2014 in its latest edition of World Economic Outlook next week.
The IMF-World Bank annual meeting is scheduled to be held Oct 10-12 in Washington.

Tata Starbucks sees potential in over 50 small Indian cities: CEOAvani Davda
("Starbucks has opened 58…)
HYDERABAD: Encouraged by the response to Starbucks stores in major Indian cities, the world's largest coffee chain is now setting its sights on tier-2 and tier-3 cities, a top company executive said.
The move comes after Tata Starbucks, the equal joint venture between Tata Global Beverages and Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Company reportedly decided to open outlets that are half the average size of existing ones for faster expansion in India.
Stating that Tata Starbucks was "growing aggressively" in India, chief executive officer Avani Davda said it has identified more than 50 tier-2 and tier-3 Indian cities "that have right kind of infrastructure."
Davda said the company is open to trying out different formats that Starbucks has introduced globally, including smaller Express stores and drive-through outlets, which account for more than 40% of the US companyoperated stores with higher average sales. "We will try and see which is right for each market," she told ET after opening the first Starbucks store in Hyderabad, in the Jubilee Hills area, on Tuesday.
The coffee chain has opened 58 stores across Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Pune, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad in 23 months and "will continue to grow," she said.
Since starting its first India outlet in October 2012, Starbucks has opened stores at an average of one every two weeks, making India its fastest-expanding market. However, Davda said, "We are not in a hurry to expand or in a hurry to say we are going to have X number of stores in this country."
Refusing to divulge details about the joint venture's financial performance, she said, "We are on track and the board is "extremely happy and satisfied with our (financial) performance so far."
According to her, Indian cities in the south, west and north offer great growth potential for Tata Starbucks. "We would like to penetrate them in the right way and we are not going to shy away from opening up the satellite markets as well," she said.

How to advance your career through networking7 Tips for Networking Success
By Arnie Fertig | U.S.News & World Report LP –  Tue 9 Sep, 2014 7:00 PM IST
"I don't feel comfortable in large groups in which I don't know anyone."
"I don't care about getting on the rubber chicken circuit and listening to boring programs."
"When I'm in a room full of accomplished people, I feel small and unimportant, because I'm unemployed ."
Perhaps one of these attitudes rings true for you. Whether you are currently working or not, there are dozens of reasons you might not want to get out of your house and make the effort to meet new people.
However, if you are serious about advancing your career, bear in mind that somewhere around 80 percent of jobs are not obtained through blind online résumé submissions or recruiters, but rather through networking. And we are now in prime networking season!
With Labor Day past, all kinds of organizations that take a summer hiatus are springing back to life with fall events, meetings, seminars and a multitude of gatherings. Leaders in virtually every field or enterprise are called on to speak at professional organizations, and others of influence are coming to hear them. Each of these events presents a valuable networking opportunity .
You should have your antenna raised to become aware of these gatherings, especially when you are searching for a job. Look for events where you can expand your network and obtain the latest information that will make you an interesting person with whom others will want to interact.
Disillusioned job seekers often complain about situations where jobs are "hard-wired." The boss knows the person that they want to hire, tailor-makes a job description that depicts him or her and goes through the motions of an open search to camouflage the fact that the hired candidate was chosen long before. The flip side of this argument, however, would be to say that the successful candidate has networked to the max!
Articles and books about networking abound, but here are some key tips to get you going and help work the room at any networking event:
1. Target multiple types of networking venues. Attend events at professional organizations that relate to your expertise or industry, but don't be content with that. There are also many other types of fruitful networking groups, such as alumni, recent graduates , professional women and young professionals. You should also seek out networking events related to your city or metro area. Companies such as Networking After Work and NetParty hold open events in many cities throughout the country and also host geographic-based LinkedIn groups.
2. Prepare a professional presence. That includes "dressing for success," personal grooming and much more. Keep your own business cards in one pocket, and place the business cards you receive into a different one. The last thing you want is to inadvertently pass out someone else's card! If you are unemployed, you still need a basic card with your name, contact information and something about the role you seek.
3. Set realistic goals and expectations. It's just fine to speak with only a key handful of people the room. Aim to establish enough of a relationship with someone that you will each want to continue the conversation later. Why give someone your card and then have him or her wonder the next day, "How did I get this business card , and why should I keep it?"
4. Figure out who you want to speak with and how to get his or her attention. For example, if the speaker at an event is a leader in a target company of yours, you might want to be close to the stage or dais to rub shoulders as the person enters or exits. Another consideration: Companies often take whole tables at events, and you can check out the tent cards or seating chart to figure out where people of interest to you will be seated.
5. Don't be a leach! Don't stand in the way of your networking partners' objectives. They come to the event with their own agendas, and they won't be favorably impressed if you take an inordinate amount of their time.
6. Pay attention to the person with whom you are speaking. Be "in the moment," and maintain eye contact. Show you are interested in what they are saying. People can tell if you are eyeing your next networking target, and they feel disrespected if they think you would rather be speaking with someone else.
7. Think: Can we talk? Remember that famous Joan Rivers line, and leave your elevator speech at home! The best networking is about engaging people in conversation and not speaking at them. No matter how much you practice that 20-, 30- or 60-second pitch, it will likely come off as just that: a rehearsed, stilted pitch. When perceived that way, it will seem like an hour to the listener. By all means, be purposeful in what you say, but talk with people and not at them.
When you practice these points, you will be well on your way to becoming more comfortable in networking situations, turning strangers into contacts, contacts into networking partners and opportunities into job offers.

Thailand arrests Myanmar men for killing two British touristsWorkers from Myanmar, Saw, left, and Win, sit together, escorted by a Thai police officer, during a press conference in Koh Tao island, Thailand. (Source: AP photo)
Associated Press | Bangkok | Posted: October 3, 2014 6:24 pm | Updated: October 3, 2014 6:26 pm
Two migrant workers from Myanmar were arrested Friday after police said they confessed to killing two British tourists whose battered bodies were found on a beach in southern Thailand last month, in a case that damaged the image of the country’s tourism industry.
Thailand’s national police chief Gen. Somyot Poompanmoung said the DNA results released late Thursday night backed up the confessions of the two men to raping and killing 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge, and killing David Miller, 24, on Koh Tao, an island known for its pristine diving sites.
“This has shown the hard work of the police and I’d like to praise the officers who are involved in working on this case, and there might be some rewards for them,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who took power after leading a military coup in May, told reporters. In the immediate aftermath of the killings, he had stirred controversy by suggesting that bikini-wearing tourists might attract such attacks, a comment for which he has apologized.
Police identified the 21-year-old workers from Myanmar’s western Rakhine state as “Win” and “Saw.” Both were detained on the island Thursday and questioned by police who brought them to the crime scene Friday to re-enact their alleged crimes, a standard part of criminal investigations in Thailand.
Crowds of onlookers watched as the suspects were led to the rocky alcove along the shore where the two bodies were discovered Sept. 15. Autopsies showed that Witheridge died from head wounds while Miller suffered severe blows to the head and drowned in the surf. It is still unclear what prompted the killings.
During the re-enactment, the two men wore flak jackets and motorcycle helmets as protection against angry residents, who fear the crime will damage tourism to the remote island.
“There was clear evidence: forensic evidence, (testimony from) witnesses and other evidence, as well as closed-circuit television footage,” Somyot told reporters. “The police and investigation teams have analyzed all evidence and it’s clear that the two suspects committed the crime on that day.”
The two face charges of murder, rape and theft, but have not yet been formally charged, Somyot said. They are expected to remain in custody until they are brought to court. He said in a telephone interview with ThaiPBS television that police searched the residence of the suspects and found a mobile phone suspected to belong to one of the British tourists.
About 2.5 million people from Myanmar work in this Southeast Asian country, most as domestic servants or in low-skilled manual labor industries like construction, fisheries or the garment sector. Thailand’s military-installed government has described migrant workers as a threat to national security, and fears have been expressed continued…

Unbeaten KKR take on CSK in CLT20 finalPress Trust of India | Bengaluru | Posted: October 3, 2014 7:05 pm
The Chennai Super Kings will have the advantage of familiarity with the conditions while the unbeaten Kolkata Knight Riders would still be a tough nut to crack. The two teams clash in the Oppo Champions League T20 final at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.
Both teams had met in the final of the 2012 Indian Premier League, when Kolkata defeated Chennai by five wickets.
In this year’s Indian Premier League both were at par, winning a game apiece against each other. However, unlike the Knight Riders, CSK have played most of their group matches here and will definitely have an edge as far as familiarity factor is concerned.
As the final is being played between two IPL rivals, the Karnataka State Cricket Association is expecting a full house after conducting neutral matches, which failed to attract crowds.
Looking at the stats, Kolkata start favourites as they are on a roll after an unbeaten run in the tournament. They have, in fact, registered 14 wins in a row starting from IPL-7.
Chennai, on the other hand, had to depend on other teams’ results to make the last-four stage. Led by Mahendra Singh
Dhoni, the team, however, has the ability to turn it around, a quality which was evident in the semifinal against a power-packed Kings XI Punjab side last night.
Dhoni knows the art of utilising his resources aptly, sometimes leaving rival captains too stunned by his decisions on batting and bowling combinations, besides the field placements.
Kolkata skipper Gautam Gambhir is equally enterprising and has shared an intense rivalry with Dhoni in IPL, coming out trumps against the India captain.
The Knight Riders are coming into the title clash with the tag of invincible post their 14th straight win – a seven-wicket victory over Australia’s Hobart Hurricanes in the first semifinal.
Kolkata, unlike Chennai, have played all their group matches in Hyderabad and will have to get used to the conditions quickly.
Shah Rukh Khan’s team though boasts of batsmen such as Gambhir, Robin Uthappa, Manish Pandey and Jacques Kallis, all of whom have loads of experience and are in good form as well.
In the bowling department, there has been some turmoil after ‘mystery spinner’ Sunil Narine was reported for suspect action in their last group match. The West Indian will not be allowed to bowl in the final.
Young Kuldeep Yadav and all-rounders such as Yusuf Pathan, Ryan ten Doeschate and Andre Russel have been quite successful.
Coming into the match after handing a crushing 65-run defeat to Punjab in the second semifinal, Chennai would love to exploit the placid Chinnaswamy pitch, where they played most of their group matches.
Opener Dwayne Smith, who had a pretty good season last IPL but has been disappointing in CLT20, would look to make continued…

Top performers benefit as India Inc goes all out to retain talentFirms like PepsiCo, Coca Cola ,others institute rewards and recognition programmes to retain talent

(Employers are realising that…)
NEW DELHI: Top performers at PepsiCo India can look forward to a cracker of a Diwali. Apart from the annual global rewards programme, vying for the chance to go to New York to meet PepsiCo's senior leadership team as well as colleagues from different regions for four-five days, top performers in the foods business could get free tickets for cricket World Cup 2015 in Australia this festive season.
In the war for talent in the resurgent job market, companies are thinking of big and frequent rewards for top talent. Employers are realising that compensation, company merchandise and annual bonuses may not be enough to retain key talent. Benefits now include perks such as those at PepsiCo, exotic vacations to locations like Greece and Monaco, and mid-year bonuses.
Since companies want to retain volumes, a large number of performers, especially millennials, are also being lured through rewards such as shopping vouchers for Flipkart and Snapdeal besides iPhones and tablets. Hemant Upadhyay, managing consultant and leader of executive rewards practice at Hay Group in India, has seen a sea change in rewards and benefits strategies of companies in the current job market.
"Employees, especially the millennials, at the junior to mid levels need much more than compensation to stay on, as they have lesser liabilities and immense opportunities. Technology is a hit with this pool of talent, so companies are doling out benefits like iPhones and the latest gadgets or online vouchers, and are making specific tailormade plans for senior employees to suit their individual needs. Rewards can't be taken for granted anymore," he said.
Upadhyay recalls one of the more special rewards this year — a client transferring the title of a company owned house to a senior executive. "It worked as a great retention tool, as the company thought that instead of stocks and compensation, the house which was provided by the company to the employee could be given to him provided he retires with them, as it would have tremendous emotional value for him. The location and architecture was such that he wouldn't have been able to buy it on his own," he said.
Given the optimism in the job market, stocks may come back into vogue and may be given to those just below the senior level who otherwise may not be entitled to them, said Shiv Agrawal, managing director of ABC Consultants.
"One clear trend is companies increasingly looking at providing benefits which give a sense of investing in self to employees. Executive education programmes are becoming increasingly popular too," he said. At Coca Cola India, a cross-functional team that conceptualized its Support My School programme, was sent to Russia and Turkey this year to learn of similar community development and sustainability projects there.
Over at Vodafone, Strike Force is the telecom company's premier programme for recognition of best performers across all circles. Top management executives accompany this select group on trips to locations such as Greece and Turkey and felicitate them at an awards ceremony. Platinum Club, the premier awards programme under Microsoft's Circle of Excellence platform, recognises top performers at a global level.
The grand prize is a stay of four nights at the Monte Carlo Bay Hotel in Monaco. "We have instituted such rewards and recognition programmes to thank employees for giving Microsoft their best every day, for believing in our brand, our culture and values, our passion for technology and innovation, our career development programmes and our social impact," said Rohit Thakur, head of HR for Microsoft in India.
PepsiCo even has a deferred bonus payout scheme to pep up employees. "This has been developed with an aim to motivate employees in the middle of the year and to increase the overall quantum of bonus payouts," said a spokesperson. Indian employers are moving away from kitchen appliances, dinner sets and dry fruits to fashion apparel and accessories besides gadgets such as iPhones, said Sagar Chaudhuri, CEO and co-founder of Bangalore-based HighFives.
 
Having worked in companies such as JP Morgan, Infosys, ICICI and Genpact, Chaudhuri and his cofounders felt there was a paucity of innovative rewards and recognition practices in companies. HighFives helps them manage reward processes with minimum administrative overheads. Chaudhuri said its reward programmes work on a point-based system. Employees can redeem points awarded for various assignments on HighFives.
Electronic gadgets such as microwaves and washing machines aside, iPhones, tablets and shopping vouchers from Jabong, Flipkart and Myntra are a hit with employees. At HCL Technologies, the share of incremental earnings to top-performing employees has increased, which means top performers are likely to get a higher proportion of rewards.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat slams India’s ‘lust for Chinese goods'

(Bhagwat’s address…)
NAGPUR: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has demanded a ban on beef exports from India, slammed Indians' lust for cheap Chinese imports and called Islamic terrorism a blowback of western greed in an address to cadres that surprised many with its largely conciliatory tone but raised the hackles of several others with its live telecast on state TV.
In his annual Vijayadashami speech at ReshimBagh headquarters of the RSS, Bhagwat on Friday touched upon topics ranging from ecology to cow slaughter to Islamic jihad as he lauded the Modi-led BJP government's performance and hinted at four states - Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Assam - as being possible focus areas for the Sangh's future political activities.
Bhagwat's address this year was being especially watched for his observations on the BJP government's performance and also cues on its future social and economic policies. Also being closely watched was for any signs of triumphalism especially after the active role Sangh cadres played to bring the BJP to power and whether it would use its influence with the government to re-assert India's Hindu identity. The RSS chief has in recent speeches asserted India's identity as a Hindu nation and said that all Indians are Hindus.
Bhagwat didn't mention any border incursions by the Chinese unlike his last year's speech, but he slammed Indian consumer's attitudes towards encouraging China which affected any possibility of increase in "self-reliance" and "Swadeshi" consumption. "Our tendency of buying daily need goods, even buying foreign made— especially Chinese--statues of our Gods and Goddesses, simply because they are cheaper in price, needs to be abandoned," he said.
The RSS leader said there was a sense of optimism prevalent in the country on account of the new government's policies. "The government should now ensure that these policies maintain their momentum in a determined and well organized manner. We need to wait for some more time, with a sense of hope and faith," he said.
Suhas Palshikar , veteran political scientist, who have been tracking Sangh Parivar politics, said there was hardly anything new in Bhagwat's speech. "There always is a certain variation, but the issues of cow slaughter, Bangladeshi immigrants etc have their usual community-oriented message," said "These are mentioned not as a hint to the government or the BJP, but to the cadres. Through these issues, the RSS would like to exert pressure on the party and the government," Palshikar said.

Delhi crime report: Malviya Nagar  Mehrauli most unsafe for womenComments
Instances of crimes against women in the Capital have not dropped despite the various measures adopted by the Delhi Police. This revelation came after an extensive ‘crime mapping’ exercise conducted in the city. The report red-flagged 44 vulnerable areas as being prone to crimes against women.
In a report submitted by the Delhi Police, 1,531 cases of rape, 3,073 cases of assault against women, 913 cases of harassment, and 2,650 cases of kidnapping of women were reported in the city until September 15 this year.
Malviya Nagar and Mehrauli were on the top when it came the molestation of women. The two spots also featured in areas with highest number of harassment cases.
The report did not go down well with the Delhi High Court, which is monitoring the situation. A bench of Justice BD Ahmed and Justice Siddharth Mridul asked the Delhi Police to haul up the station house officers and assistant commissioners of police of the 44 ‘red-flagged’ areas.
The crime mapping, which was a first-of-its-kind effort to scientifically deal with the problem, had yielded positive results in terms of the data acquired on instances of rapes, molestation of women, and harasmment and the pockets where crimes of such nature occur more frequently than others.
 However, the action taken so far by Delhi police in terms of better policing, gender sensitisation and public awareness programmes has not helped in bringing down crimes against women, the Delhi State Legal Service Authority (DSLSA) said.
The DSLSA has proposed to open legal service clinics (LSCs) at all the identified 44 police stations in eight districts to help women and girls who are victims of sexual assault, rape, molestation, and eve teasing.
 It also stretched upon the need for sensitisation of schoolboys, regular parent-teacher meetings (PTM) in government schools to check cases of harassment of schoolgirls. The HC has posted the case for further hearing on October 15.

All the five payloads of Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) — India’s maiden spacecraft to Mars — have started operating  after entering the Red Planet’s orbit.

“All the payloads have been activated and checked. We have also started getting the data. While the laboratory matching has been done, we have to yet interpret the data,” an Isro official said.
India had entered an elite space club when its spacecraft entered Mars’ orbit on September 24.
See: MoM payloads interactive
The 1,350 kilogram orbiter  spacecraft carries five payloads for gathering scientific data that may shed light on Martian weather systems as well as what happened to the water that is believed to have existed once on Mars.
None of the instruments will send back enough information to answer these questions definitively, but experts say the data will help them better understand how planets form and what conditions might make life possible.
While the scientific instruments will work for 6 months, there is a possibility of its life span exceeding beyond that.
Meanwhile Isro  is  gearing for the launch of IRNSS-IC on October 10 at 0156 hours .
The IRNSS is an independent regional navigational satellite system being developed by India. It is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending to 1,500 km from its boundary. The IRNSS would provide two services, with the Standard Positioning Service open for all the users and the Restricted Service, encrypted one for authorised users. IRNSS-1B was launched in April this year. Its predecessor IRNSS-1A was launched in July 2013.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday gave a thumbs up to the Narendra Modi government in his annual Vijaya Dashami address controversially telecast live on Doordarshan.
Bhagwat lauded Modi for his initiatives on national security, economy and international relations and said that his government 'is moving in the right direction.'
He said people should give some more time to the Modi government for expedition and efficient execution of its policies.

DD telecast abuse of state power: Cong, Left
For the first time ever, the RSS chief's speech was telecast live on Doordarshan prompting the Congress and Left parties to accuse the Modi government of misusing the state broadcaster.
Terming the live telecast a "dangerous tradition" Congress spokesman Sandeep Dikshit said, "This is not an organisation which is completely neutral. It is a controversial organisation."
The CPI(M) condemned the telecast saying, "The national public broadcaster has no business to telecast live the speech of the chief of an organisation like the RSS."
Doordarshan officials defended the live coverage saying it was a newsworthy event.

Watch: Modi's US visit gives us renewed hope, says RSS chief Bhagwat
In his hour-long speech, Bhagwat, who had once pulled up the rank and file of the Sangh Parivar for shouting "Namo, Namo" and contested Narendra Modi giving credit to BJP chief Amit Shah for the election victory, showered praises on the government.
He said positive signs are emanating that give people the hope that India is emerging stronger on the international stage.
"There is no magic wand to change to change things, but the government seems committed," said the RSS chief who normally criticises the central government every year.
Bhagwat said Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to the US has sent positive signals and ushered in a new enthusiasm among people of the country.
"A new ray of hope has entered the hearts of the people. The entire country was feeling proud of the visit and the subsequent talks with the US government," he said, adding, the world needs India.
Voicing concern over 'upsurge in jihadi activities' in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the RSS chief said the state governments there were doing nothing to tackle the threat this posed to citizens.
He also criticised the governments in West Bengal and Assam saying, "The population imbalance in West Bengal and Assam has been caused by illegal migration of a particular community from across the national border. The ruling parties in those states have adopted a 'near surrender policy." 
The RSS chief also called for a ban on beef exports, and for an end to widespread purchases of Chinese products.
Speaking on global terrorism, he blamed western countries for the rise of Islamic State. "The selfish interest by the western countries is fully responsible for a new incarnation of terror and fundamentalism that emerged in West Asia in the name of ISIS," Bhagwat said.
RSS chief raised relevant issues: Modi
Meanwhile, PM Modi hailed Bhagwat's speech and said the issues of social reform he raised "are very relevant."
 
"Mohan Bhagwat ji talked about important national issues in his speech. The issues of social reform that he raised are very relevant today," Modi tweeted.

Thirty-two people, most of them women and children, were killed and several injured in a stampede that broke out this evening at the Gandhi Maidan in Patna shortlyafter the Dussehra celebrations there had ended. The tragedy occurred when people were returning after watching the "Ravan Vadh" ceremony at the Bihar capital's main Dussehra event at Gandhi Maidan where a huge crowd had gathered to witness the event, police said.

Mkts may consolidate; IT  auto likely to do well: Mahesh PatilBirla Sun Life Mutual Fund
(In the near-term, the market…)
Information technology (IT) and automobile shares are expected to do well, while the broader market could consolidate going forward, according to Mahesh Patil , chief investment officer, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund . In an interview with ET's Nishanth Vasudevan, Patil said investors should avoid sectors linked to global commodities. Edited excerpts:
What is your outlook for the market for the rest of the year? There is concern that valuations are stretched after the rally so far this year.
In the near-term, the market could consolidate after the good run and can even see some minor correction on the back of global cues. The global risk can emanate from geo-political concerns such as from Iraq or from the US Fed's comments on likely timing of increase in interest rates. On the domestic front, the large PSU disinvestment and fund-raising pipeline of corporate India will increase the supply of equity paper, which can suck out liquidity. However, we remain structurally positive on the equity market. Macro-economic indicators like inflation, current account deficit, GDP growth are all showing signs of improving. The year-till-date outperformance of the market has led to rerating for market valuations, which are currently slightly above the long-term average. Usually, at the inflexion point in an economy, the markets tend to move ahead of fundamentals and may look a bit expensive. We believe that corporate earnings growth over the next 3-4 years can compound at 18% every year, which will normalise the expansion seen in market multiples. So even with slightly elevated valuations, equity markets can deliver handsome returns over next few years.
The Fed appears to be on track to raise rates by mid-2015. How will Indian markets react? Will the rupee weaken once Fed signals further monetary tightening?
Historically, interest rate increases when coming out of a downturn and accommodative monetary policy signals confidence in economic recovery. This coincides with equity markets performing quite well as economic growth leads to higher earnings. There could be bouts of volatility around the time of the first rate increase by Fed. However, over the next few months, the market will take this in its stride and will be driven by the underlying fundamentals. India looks favourable compared to most other large global markets. Similar principle would apply to the rupee also. There is a possibility of volatility around the time of rate hikes and then there would be stabilisation over the next few months. India is in a much favourable situation today compared to a year ago with current account deficit estimated to be below 2% and forex reserves at more than nine months of imports. The rupee should most likely remain around 60 within a small range.
Is it time to go back to exporters — technology and pharma?
IT and pharma, apart from being export-oriented sectors, are also defensive in nature with steady growth visibility. In absolute terms, we expect these sectors to give 15% to 20% return over a one-year period. In the IT sector, SMAC (social, mobility, analytics & cloud) technology is driving a digital revolution across industries and enterprise clients are resuming discretionary spend to future-proof their businesses. Improving client demand, stemming from cycliIT and pharma, apart from being export-oriented sectors, are also defensive in nature with steady growth visibility. In absolute terms, we expect these sectors to give 15% to 20% return over a one-year period. In the IT sector, SMAC (social, mobility, analytics & cloud) technology is driving a digital revolution across industries and enterprise clients are resuming discretionary spend to future-proof their businesses. Improving client demand, stemming from cyclical recovery in key geographies and rising discretionary spend, is driving our optimism in the IT sector. In pharma also, we continue to remain positive as the US generic exports segment provides a large opportunity for Indian pharma companies to leverage their cost competitiveness. Also, a strong product-filing pipeline from Indian pharma companies continues to provide growth visibility.
Which sectors do you expect to outperform over the next 3-6 months? Why?
We expect the IT and auto sectors to do well in the next few months. The IT sector's valuations for most large companies is still below the market multiples and with improving outlook and some more upgrades likely in the space, it is expected to outperform. The auto sector is an early play on domestic recovery. The auto demand is on an improving trend with most segments registering double-digit year-on-year growth in the last few months. Our discussions with dealers suggest consumer interest is back and most are expecting strong retail sales in the festive season.
Many mid- and small-caps are trading at astounding valuations. Is it a good time to book profits?
At current prices, mid-cap valuations are almost in line with the large caps. In the past, mid-caps have traded at about 10 to 15% discount to large caps. Given the valuations, midcaps may underperform large caps in the near term. However, in the past, we have observed that in a rising economic growth environment and improved liquidity, mid-cap earnings tend to grow faster than large caps'. Hence, despite higher valuations, good quality mid-caps with decent growth outlook would still outperform the broader market over the next few years.
Which sectors should investors avoid?
The global growth is still sluggish. China, which has been the single-largest consumer of commodities, is also facing challenges to sustain growth at higher levels. With the dollar strengthening on the back of gradual withdrawal of QE by the US, commodities as a basket are looking weak. Hence, we would recommend avoiding sectors linked to global commodities in general.

Islamic State militants behead British hostage Alan Henning in new videoNew ISIS video shows beheading of British hostage
AP

An internet video released on Friday shows an Islamic State group fighter beheading British hostage Alan Henning, the fourth such killing carried out by the extremist group now targeted in US-led airstrikes.
The video mirrored other beheading videos shot by the Islamic State group, which now holds territory along the border of Syria and Iraq, and ended with a militant threatening a man they identified as an American named Peter Kassig.
"Obama, you have started your aerial bombardment of Shams (Syria), which keeps on striking our people, so it is only right that we continue to strike the neck of your people," the masked militant in the video said.
National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden confirmed that Kassig was being held by Islamic State militants, in a statement issued on Friday evening.
"At this point we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video released earlier today (Friday). We will continue to use every tool at our disposal - military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence - to try to bring Peter home to his family," Hayden said.
The Associated Press could not immediately verify the video's authenticity, though it was released in the same manner as other Islamic State group videos and the masked militant sounded similar to the one who carried out the other slayings.

Britain has been supporting US military efforts against the Islamic State group by using British forces to help with logistics and intelligence gathering, as well as recently taking part in airstrikes in Iraq. The internet video released Friday begins with a news clip announcing British strikes against the Islamic State group.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said Henning's apparent slaying showed "how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are."
"Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need," Cameron said in a statement. "The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these... terrorists.
"We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice."
President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, said the US had seen the video and was evaluating it.

Later, Obama said the United States strongly condemned Henning's "brutal murder." He said the US, along with Britain and other allies, will "work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder" to justice and will continue to "taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic State group.
French President Francois Hollande said he is "outraged by the heinous crime."
"This crime like previous ones will not be unpunished. France will continue to lend support to the people and authorities of Iraq in their fight against terrorism," Hollande said in a statement.
On Friday night, the UN Security Council condemned the video, saying it "once again illustrates the brutality" of the Islamic State group, adding that its members believe "such continued acts of barbarism perpetrated by ISIL do not intimidate them but rather stiffen their resolve."
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group. The full beheadings are not shown in the videos, but the British-accented, English-speaking militant holds a long knife and appears to begin cutting his victims, who include American reporter James Foley, American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and now Henning.
FBI director James Comey has said American officials believe they know the identity of the masked militant, though he's declined to name the man or reveal his nationality.
Kassig, a 26-year-old American now threatened by the Islamic State group, enlisted in the Army in 2004, and became a Ranger, ultimately serving in the 75th Ranger Regiment, an Army special operations unit.
According to his military record, Kassig trained at Fort Benning, Georgia in 2006, and deployed to Iraq from April to July 2007. He was medically discharged at the rank of private first class in September 2007. His home of record at the time of his enlistment was Indianapolis, Indiana.
His parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, issued a statement through a media relations firm, asking for the world to pray for their son.
"The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning. We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration," the statement said. "We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe."
The family said Kassig had been working for the relief organization SERA when he was captured on October 1, 2013 on his way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria. He converted to Islam while in captivity and the family has heard from former hostages that his faith has provided him comfort.
Henning, 47, nicknamed "Gadget," had joined an aid convoy and was taken captive on December 26, shortly after crossing the border between Turkey and Syria. Earlier this week, Henning's wife Barbara Henning asked the militants in a televised plea: "Please release him. We need him back home."
Dozens of Muslim leaders in Britain have urged the Islamic State group to release Henning. His wife had said she had been given hope by "the outcry across the world" over her husband's imprisonment.
Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Henning "a British hero."
His "barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world," Shafiq said.
The Islamic State group has its roots in al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody 3-year civil war in neighbouring Syria, growing stronger to the point of being able to launch a lightning offensive across much of northern Iraq, routing security forces there and shooting down an Iraqi helicopter on Friday. The group has become known for filming and releasing footage of mass shootings it conducts, as well as beheading opponents and targeting religious and ethnic minorities in the areas it attacks.
The extremist group has been widely denounced by mainstream Muslim authorities.
Other foreigners are believed held by the Islamic State group. On Friday, the father of John Cantlie, a British photojournalist held by the group, appealed for his release in a video, saying he was a friend of Syria.

Blame game after 32 killed in Dussehra day stampede in PatnaBlame game after 33 killed in Dussehra day stampede in Patna

At least 33 people were killed and more than 50 injured on Friday in a stampede, shortly after Dussehra celebrations had ended at Gandhi Maidan in the heart of Patna.

The incident occurred around 7.05pm at Ram Ghulam Chowk in front of the southern exit of the Maidan, as a crowd of over 70,000 was leaving the venue after watching giant effigies of Ravana set ablaze.
Around 26 people were admitted at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) with two of them seriously injured, said Patna district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma.
Eyewitnesses claimed the stampede was triggered by rumours that some people had come in contact with a live wire.
In the ensuing panic, slippers and shoes were seen strewn on a 500-metre-stretch as people tried to flee from the scene. “There was such a rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over,” Verma said.
Locals also blamed the absence of any lighting at the venue for the accident. “No preparation was in place to account for the mass exit by thousands of people from a single gate in darkness at the same time,” said a man present at the spot.
Angry spectators raised slogans against the administration for allegedly closing an exit near the western side of the venue for VIP movement. The Maidan has four exits but only two were used on Friday, they claimed.
The state government also announced ex-gratia of Rs. 3 lakh each for the next of kin of the dead. A high level probe has been ordered, said home secretary Amir Subhani. Health secretary Deepak Kumar has been deputed at the PMCH to coordinate medical facilities.
The Centre also announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased and a compensation of Rs. 50,000 for critically injured.
Identity of the deceased is yet to be ascertained.
Rapid action force (RAF) team was rushed to the spot where the stampede took place and the police resorted to a mild lathi charge to disperse protestors and miscreants resorting to arson, said a TV report showing visuals of the late evening development.
A woman injured in the stampede claimed even though the stampede was triggered by rumour of a 'live wire' coming in contact with some people exiting the venue, an earlier police lathi charge to control the stampede ended up worsening the situation.
The scene at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), where the injured had been admitted, was tense as the hospital had run out of medicines.
People had gathered outside the central casualty of the hospital in large number, but were unable to get any information about the dead or the injured.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences and spoke to the Bihar chief minister to enquire about the stampede.
"The stampede in Patna is deeply saddening. I spoke to the Bihar CM about the situation.My condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and prayers with the injured," he tweeted.

Union communication minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was also critical of the lapses on part of the state government and said the government is closely monitoring the situation.

Congress President Sonia Gandhi also expressed "shock and grief" over the deaths and injuries.
"Dismayed at the unfortunate incident, Gandhi expressed the hope that the injured are being adequately attended to and conveyed her condolences to the families of those who passed away," a Congress statement said.
Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan has sought a probe by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) into the administrative lapses, leading to the stampede.
Talking to ANI in New Delhi, he said that the MHA should seriously ponder about conducting an inquiry into today's stampede as well as the one last year during the Chhath festival. He said he would travel down to Patna on Saturday.
BJP leader CP Thakur, who visited the hospital, said: "Prima facie the stampede appears to be due to administrative lapses."
Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, in a tweet, squarely blamed the state government for administrative failure, leading to the stampede.
This is the second such tragedy in Patna in less than two years. During the Chhath festival in  November 2012, 21 people had died in a similar stampede.
The Gandhi Maidan has a capacity to accommodate up to 4.5 - 5 lakh people. It is the same venue where a series of explosions took place during the Lok Sabha campaign event of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that left six dead.

PM Modi  on radio debut  urges people to join Clean India campaignComments
In a free-wheeling chatty address to the nation, through radio, Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a clarion call to citizens to join his social initiatives and contribute to nation-building. He also promised to stay in touch and connect - at least once, if not twice, a month with citizens on radio, becoming the first Indian Prime minister to reach out to citizens on such a regular basis, directly.
Modi used his debut on radio – during a programme titiled Mann ki Baat -  to remind listeners of his Swachh Bharat, Clean India, campaign. He spoke of the nine people he had invited to join the campaign, and urged every citizen to do the same - clean up, encourage another nine people to do so, and create a movement.
Modi also promoted the use of khadi, and said he was not asking people to wear only khadi. “But even if you use one khadi product, it will light the lamp of prosperity in the house of a poor person.”
The PM peppered his speech with anecdotes which had a running theme – of motivating and energizing citizens, and recognising their inner strength. This has been a constant thread of Modi’s addresses, be it at the Independence Day or in US or during the Swachh Bharat pledge.
Read: Modi invokes Bapu, wields broom for filth-free India  
Modi’s emphasis has been that the country is not only that of the government, but of the people, and citizens have to step up.
“You know, our scientists have undertaken the Mars mission successfully at minimum expenses. There is nothing lacking in our capabilities. We only have forgotten our strengths. We have forgotten ourselves as if we have become despondent.
My brothers and sisters, this cannot be,” said Modi."We need to recognise our internal strengths," he added. "The 125 crore Indians are blessed with immense skill and strength. All we need to do is to understand our strengths."
Modi spoke of his engagement with specially-abled children, and how they are the responsibility of not just their parents, but of the society and the country. He also spoke of skill development, and environment.
But more than the message, the novelty on Friday was in Modi’s choice of the medium and his direct engagement.
Modi plans to make his radio speeches once or twice a month on Sunday mornings to get his message across to two-thirds of the country’s 1.2 billion people who listen regularly to the radio.
Presidents and prime ministers generally use radio to address the people on Republic Day and Independence Day, but Modi’s address is the start of a regular slot on air for the prime minister.
He addressed millions of school students across the country on state-run Doordarshan on Teachers’ Day, but radio will help him reach deeper into the country as All India Radio has a much wider reach.
To make the communication two-way, Modi added if citizens wanted to respond, they could do so over email and letters. "If you have ideas and actual incidents which are constructive, do share with me. Together let us serve India and take our nation to newer heights," Modi said.

'Raavan' effigy with officials' name on it burnt in Jodhpur

Jodhpur: Protesting against non-payment of dues by Jodhpur Development Authority (JDA), an association of contractors burnt an effigy of 'Raavan' with names of the agency's officials on it on the occasion of Dusshera on Friday.
Celebrating Dusshera, which marks the defeat of the demon king Raavan, members of Contractor Sangharsh Samiti burnt an effigy of Raavan with names of various officials, including the Chairman, on it in front of the JDA office.
"Since Raavan Dahan symbolises the triumph of good over bad, we thought it appropriate to go the same way to draw the attention of common man to the prevailing corruption in the JDA, owing to which, we are today in a condition of financial penury and compelled to stall all developmental works in the city," said Ismail Beg, spokesperson of the Samiti, which has been demonstrating in front of the JDA office for over a fortnight.
Members of Contractor Sangharsh Samiti burnt an effigy of Raavan with names of various officials, including the Chairman, on it in front of the JDA office.

According to him they have about Rs 300 crore, including Rs 100 crores to be billed yet, outstanding with the JDA, which has compelled them to stop all the developmental works across the city.
Some Samiti members had met the Divisional Commissioner, Hemant Gera, who holds additional charge of the Chairman of the JDA, who said "he would not release the payment against works in non-plan areas, which constitute about 80 per cent of the total outstanding payment," said Beg.

The Fed Is Even Afraid To Ask Goldman Sachs The Easy QuestionsThe Fed Is Even Afraid To Ask Goldman Sachs The Easy Questions

There's a startling moment in the recently released audio recordings of Goldman Sachs bankers talking to their regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But it's not shocking for the reasons you might assume.
The tapes -- secretly recorded by then-bank examiner Carmen Segarra, whom the New York Fed employed for seven months in late 2011 and early 2012 to keep tabs on Goldman -- don't capture any craven wrongdoing by the bank. (Goldman Sachs responded with a short, dismissive statement last week when the tapes were made public.) Instead, it's the New York Fed that comes off looking terrible -- deferential and ineffectual, and apparently concerned above all with accommodating the banks it was supposed to regulate. It's a perfect picture of a culture structured by regulatory capture.
For instance: ProPublica reporter Jake Bernstein describes a meeting where a senior Goldman compliance executive "mentioned that Goldman's view was that once clients were wealthy enough, certain consumer laws didn't apply to them."
That sounds cavalier, and Segarra was "shocked" to hear it. She wanted to ask the executive what he had meant. Her colleagues at the New York Fed, however, told Segarra she didn't hear what she heard -- and even if she had, the executive didn't really mean it. Asking for a follow-up explanation was never raised as a possibility.
This immediate instinct to shut down any questions about Goldman's behavior is not the reaction you want from a regulator. And it's made all the worse because Segarra's question in this case was actually quite benign. There's a very easy explanation for that executive's comment: It's true.
Wealthy individuals can qualify with the Securities and Exchange Commission as accredited investors . This means they can invest in more things and have fewer protections afforded to them.
In this case, the SEC defines wealthy as an individual or married couple with a net worth greater than $1 million, excluding the value of their first home. Alternatively, an investor can qualify if they’ve made more than $200,000 in the each of the past two years, or over $300,000 as a married couple over the same time frame. Trusts with more than $5 million in assets can also qualify. Becoming an accredited investor allows you to buy a broader range of financial products, and crucially in this context, it allows banks to sell you a far broader range of financial products with fewer investor protections built in. For instance, banks can sell accredited investors unregistered offerings, which allow companies to only disclose information the company decides to release. Registered offerings, on the other hand, have a long list of information that companies are required to disclose. Non-accredited investors can buy unregistered offerings, but only if the same information is disclosed as would be in a registered offering. Accredited investors can also participate in private offerings without any limitations. Only 35 non-accredited investors can participate in a private placement, and they must be considered “sophisticated.”
That's a slightly more precise version of what the Goldman executive said, but people practicing in an expert and jargon-filled field often talk in shorthand. Both the New York Fed and Goldman are familiar with accredited investor rules (or they certainly should be, at any rate). It should have been easy to clarify if this was in fact what the executive was talking about, but we can’t know for certain if the explanation is this benign, because the Fed never asked.  So if there was the possibility of an innocent explanation like this, why were Segarra's colleagues so loath to ask questions about what that executive said?
If the Fed is too afraid to ask Goldman Sachs questions when the bank could well be in the right, how can it be expected to ask questions when the answer might point to even a hint of wrongdoing? That would be awkward. And the avoidance of awkwardness -- no matter the consequence for regulation -- seems to be a very high priority for the New York Fed.

RIL may lease fuel retailing outlets to PSU oil marketing companiesReliance Industries likely to lease, restart retail pumps

(Reliance Industries may…)
MUMBAI: Reliance Industries may lease fuel retailing outlets to public sector oil marketing companies and is also preparing to restart some of them on hopes diesel prices will be freed from government control, executives aware of the development said.
Reliance Industries closed all its 1,432 fuel outlets across India by 2008 as sales declined and losses mounted because private marketers could not match the subsidised prices offered by state-owned Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation .
Now, the Mukesh Ambani-led company is trying to come up with a plan to optimise returns on its assets amid expectations that prices of diesel, India's most-consumed fuel, will be deregulated. "There is an offer from Reliance Industries for leasing. But it is still to be evaluated. Some of their pumps are at a good location, so leasing them would save us cost of setting up a pump," a senior official from HPCL told ET.
"Once we have clarity on diesel pricing we will look at the economics of the proposal." Reliance, too, is said to be waiting for more clarity on deregulation of diesel prices, which appears imminent, given the changes in the pricing regime. The government, seeking to cut its subsidy bill, alowed diesel prices to be increased by about 50 paise per litre almost every month since January 2013.
In addition, global prices have softened and the rupee has appreciated against the US dollar, helping OMCs to make a profit on the fuel. "RIL has started talking to dealers to re-start the petrol pumps. Their strategy could be a mix of leasing out some pumps to OMCs and running some others on their own," an industry executive aware of the development told ET.
An official query sent to RIL seeking comment remained unanswered. Indian Oil did not respond to ET's query, while executives at BPCL declined to comment. Executives at OMCs, speaking on condition of anonymity, said RIL has initiated talks but they are at a very early stage and the proposals have not been considered by the companies yet.
In 2002, private companies including RIL and Essar captured almost 15% of the fuel retail market. Industry players expect competition to revive with the re-entry of private players.
"IOC could be relatively better placed in protecting market share, given its extensive pipeline and retail network," Citi Research said in a report last month.

Concrete steps, not just marketing campaigns needed to make India a clean country

(The notification, which…)
For starters, it will take more than televised tokenism to clean up India. Today, a fraction of the country's liquid waste gets treated. The rest is dumped into rivers and ponds. Most solid waste goes into landfills unsegregated, where it contaminates land and groundwater.
And that is without getting into discussions on hazardous wastes and pollution. Without fixing all these, India cannot be cleaned up. To take just one instance of the scale of the problem, the website of the Central Pollution Control Board, the apex body dealing with pollution in India, has a report called 'Status Report on Municipal Solid Waste Management'.
It says, "1,27,486 tons per day (TPD) municipal solid waste was generated in 2011-12. Out of which, 89,334 TPD of MSW was collected and 15,881 TPD processed or treated." In other words, 30% of the waste was not collected. 87.55% of waste was dumped untreated. As per a senior official in the environment ministry, who spoke to ET, offiials are working on a new notification for solid waste disposal.
The notification, which is yet to reach minister Prakash Javadekar , recommends a dramatic overhaul of how waste is treated in India. "Solid waste management cannot happen unless we ensure segregation — between organic and inorganic waste — at the household level," the official said.
According to him, instead of relying on municipalities to collect the waste, India should turn to her ragpickers — like Pune did. "Each ragpicker can handle 200-300 households. Even if each household pays them Rs 30, that will translate into a monthly income of `6,000-9,000," the official said . The organic waste , he says, should first go for bio-methanation.
"The gas can be used as energy for running buses, etc. The remaining waste, if passed through vermi-composting, becomes topclass manure." As for inorganic waste like plastic and tins, says the official, those should be the ragpickers' property. "Then, s/he will go and sell these. Only someone with a use for them will buy — which means it will be recycled. We may give households 2 years to start segregating their waste — initially cajoling and then enforcing," he said.
The ministry is thinking of setting itself a target of 60% coverage in the first two years and 90% in the next two. The ministry proposes a similar architecture for liquid waste management to water resources minister Uma Bharati. Untreated liquid waste from households is one of the biggest pollutants in rivers. Their E.Coli charts, a proxy for faecal matter, is off the charts in parts of the country.
The ministry proposes that in towns with population below 50,000, the waste be diverted into septic tanks — which can be treated to capture gas and then use the residue to produce manure.
In bigger towns, says the official, the country needs to set up sewerage reatment plants. "We should not set these up under grants but as a business model," he says. As per the ministry's calculations, an STP set up with a 25-year loan at 6%, which uses methane to generate power, will need to charge local households Rs 80 a month to stay viable.
If, he adds, it also sells the wastewater from the plant for non-potable use, the cost per household will come down to Rs 50. The proposal is with Bharati right now. However, cleaning up India will take more than just fixing her solid and liquid waste problems.
There is construction debris which needs to be crushed and mandatorily reused — after conversion into tiles, etc. The government wants a clean India but wants to push coal. It wants clean air but is blase about forest destruction — it has recently passed nebulously determined forest diversion norms.
The government needs to crack down on polluters, move towards cleaner fuels and lower emissions, and start protecting forests and rivers.

Task is enormous  requires change in individual behaviourIt is also essential to define what swachh actually means. Building toilets is an important dimension. But there are at least two other equally significant ones: hygiene and how we deal with garbage.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
By Vinita Bali
Finally, it is great to have a leader not just talk about 'Swachh Bharat' but also set a timeline within which to achieve it. Even though this is a mandate from the prime minister, it has to be delivered for the people of India by the people of India. The task is enormous and will require a change in individual behaviour as well as a transformation in the back-end capability to provide the tools, processes, systems and structures that make hygiene, cleanliness and sanitation achievable and sustainable.
It is also essential to define what swachh actually means. Building toilets is an important dimension. But there are at least two other equally significant ones: hygiene and how we deal with garbage. Several countries have adopted WASH (Water, Sanitation & Hygiene) as part of their nutrition-sensitive interventions.
There are significantly improved nutritional outcomes as a consequence of better hygiene, sanitation and access to potable water.
Right now, we are perfectly engineered to co-exist with the lack of sanitation that surrounds us. Unless the entire system is overhauled, we will not see a lasting effect. That system includes each of us as generators of garbage and various organisations, from municipal corporations to the ministries that deal with solutions to hygiene and sanitation.
All three — hygiene, sanitation and garbage — require an understanding of the hardware and software that must be activated to get the final result. There are several examples of serious initiatives to build toilets in cities (hardware) that fall into disuse very quickly because the beneficiaries don't see the value proposition.
Understanding the economic and social model that makes this goal palpable, achievable and enduring is critical to its success.
Unless we adopt a systemic approach and hold each actor in the chain accountable (through motivating a behavioural change and/or by imposing hefty penalties for non-compliance), we are unlikely to meet with enduring success.
Take the case of garbage and the perennial reality of landfills on the one hand, and garbage everywhere on our streets, on the other.
Not segregating at source makes the problem even more obtuse.
Add to that the fact that we seem to be over-packing everything — magazines are sold in plastic covers, bouquets of flowers are generously wrapped in a lot of paper, five-star hotels pack slippers in a plastic bag which is then put in a cardboard!
The travesty is that we have enough answers and commonsense solutions to get started.
Talk to anyone who has spent any time in garbage and they will give you the mantra of reduce-reuserecycle and segregate the wet and dry at source — both of which intuitively make sense and are doable, once we have the conviction and the desire to be part of the solution.
For us to get started and focused, we also need to create an architecture of how garbage must be handled.
Of the approximately 4,000 tonnes of garbage generated every day in Bangalore, bulk generators like offices, hotels, schools and colleges account for over half. These are easily identifiable and reachable targets that also have the capacity and capability of reducing, recycling and reusing their own garbage by investing in simple available technologies that enable the wet garbage to be composted and the dry garbage to be recycled, or even converted to polymer oil in the case of plastics. Even though solutions are known, there is apathy among the institutions to tackle this issue systemically.
Swachh Bharat requires a lot more than brooms on the streets. It requires a comprehensive and coordinated effort to create the back-end infrastructure to deal with solutions to segregate at source, create dry waste collection centres, compost the wet waste to make it reusable as soil, etc. Most of all it will require a massive behavioural change and significant investment in creating a garbage management system that uses science, technology and logistics that convert garbage to something of value. Take the example of fleece jackets and plastic furniture made from PET bottles, or polymer fuel from all kinds of plastics.
The Andolan has to be achieved with comprehensive programmes, a tighter regulatory framework (eg. all buildings with more than a 100 people have to compulsorily deal with their wet waste) and large-scale participation.
We have to envision a country that does not force its children to become ragpickers to eke out a living.

Indian biotech industry is on cusp of entering new eraIndian biotech industry is on cusp of entering new era, says BIO CEO Jim Greenwood
Lalit K Jha     Washington   Last Updated: October 3, 2014  | 12:51 IST

India's biotechnology industry is on the cusp of entering a new era as it already has many of the necessities required to grow its bio economy such as a talented and enthusiastic scientific workforce, Jim Greenwood, CEO Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) said on Thursday.
"In 2012, Indian industry and government leaders set an ambitious yet attainable goal of growing the nation's bio economy to more than $100 billion by 2025,", said Jim Greenwood.
"BIO believes that the Indian biotechnology industry is on the cusp of entering a new era when it can provide significant economic growth and development to the people of India and around the world," he said.
It needs only to address some fundamental areas of policy and regulation, and take steps towards creating an environment that encourages, not discourages, investment by innovators.
"Because we see the potential that can result from collaborating with our Indian partners, BIO and the Association of Biotechnology-Led Enterprises produced a comprehensive road map for the nation's biotechnology industry, in which we identify major areas that require Prime Minister Modi's attention," Greenwood said.
"Without developing a pro-innovation environment, the Indian biotechnology industry will not be able to achieve its high potential and the world will not benefit from what could be the Asia Pacific region's dominant biotech hub," he said.
Greenwood welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's five-day visit to the United States which the Indian leader has described as a highly "successful and satisfactory trip".
BIO is the world's largest trade association representing biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organisations across the US and in more than 30 other nations.

Sarita Devi apologises for refusing to accept medalBoxer Sarita Devi apologises for refusing to accept medal
By By Julian Linden | Reuters –  Fri 3 Oct, 2014
Print
INCHEON: Indian boxer L Sarita Devi has apologised for her petulant display at the Asian Games when she refused to accept her bronze medal.
Sarita issued an unconditional apology on Friday for her "emotional behaviour" at Wednesday's medal presentation for the women's lightweight division.
"I regret and apologise. Such an incident will never reoccur in the future," she wrote in a letter sent to the International Boxing Federation (AIBA).
Sarita was furious after losing her semi-final bout with South Korea's Park Ji-na on Tuesday, believing she should have been declared the winner.
Her husband launched an expletive-laden tirade at the judges and Sarita lodged a protest against the decision but it was rejected, triggering cries of foul play from the Indian team.
The following day, she refused to wear the bronze medal when it was presented to her, taking it only in her hand before trying to drape it over Park.
When the presentation was over, Sarina left the medal behind, despite being told by the organisers to take it with her.
The AIBA took a dim view of her behaviour and submitted a formal report to the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), requesting disciplinary action be taken against her.
AIBA supervisor David Francis also criticised the Indian team's behaviour in a strongly worded, saying: "The whole incident looked like a well planned scenario by her and her team, and it is regretful to watch a boxer refuse the medal regardless of what happened in the competition."
The Head of the Indian delegation in Incheon denied that the team had planned the incident, saying Sarina's refusal to accept the medal was a "spontaneous knee jerk reaction."
The Indian team leader Adille J Sumariwalla also asked the AIBA to consider her apology and all the circumstances when deciding if any further disciplinary action is to be taken.

India  US need each other to tackle terrorism: US lawmakerIndia, US need each other to tackle terrorism: US lawmaker
Seema Hakhu Kachru     Houston   Last Updated: October 3, 2014  | 13:22 IST
PM Narendra Modi (Photo: Reuters)
Calling the two countries as "natural partners", a top US lawmaker has said that America cannot afford to neglect India and that both need each other to tackle the growing threat of terrorism.
Senator John Cornyn said this in his address to over 600 prominent businessmen and community leaders during an annual gala hosted by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston, that marked 15 years of building strong ties between the city's business community and India.
On the issue of the growing threat of terrorism, Cornyn stated that the US cannot afford to neglect India and the two countries need each other to tackle the threat of terrorism.
Cornyn praised the Chamber for strengthening "the critically important US-India partnership ."
He believed that the "ideological bond" between the two nations would translate into a "powerful partnership" as natural allies on the world stage.
Noting the successful Indian Mars mission, he saw opportunities for collaboration with NASA in Houston.
The truth is, he said, America and India are "natural partners".
In 2004, Cornyn and then-Senator Hillary Clinton had founded the Senate India Caucus as a bipartisan coalition and forum for senators to work closely with Indian government officials and Indian-Americans in promoting US-India bilateral relations and to candidly discuss issues of common interest.
He said, the India Caucus is the only single-country caucus and it reflects the great recognition of the strategic alliance that should exist between the two nations.
He said that there are several priorities that the US needs to focus on the primary one being federal approval for the export of LNG to India which he has "pushed" to accelerate this process as it will be good for the partnership mutual strategic interests of the two countries.
The Chief Guest of the evening, Judge Ed Emmett believed that "India is our future."
He was proud to take a trade mission to India in December and stated that it was not just a trade mission but "a partnership," he said.
According to him, India is not just "an economic partner but a spiritual partner as well."
The gala was also attended by Noble Prize Winner (1996) Robert Curl and University of Houston Chancellor Renu Khator, among others.

Grenade found on Modi standby aircraft was left over from anti-terror drill  says AirIndiaA defused grenade was found on a plane that kept as a standby for PM Narendra Modi. (Source: PTI)
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 10:53 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 11:48 am
A defused grenade found on Friday night in the business class of an Air India jumbo aircraft kept as standby for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent US visit, could have been the remanant of an anti-terror drill.
The grenade was found by the Air India crew on board the Boeing 747-400 which was operating the Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah flight, airline sources said. On landing at Jeddah, the incident was reported to the local security agencies who took over the aircraft, sources said.
An AI executive said that it was the “plastic casing” of a shell of a stun grenade used by security during the anti terror drills carried out in the plane and that it was “completely harmless”. The airline is carrying out its investigations and the aircraft has been held back at Jeddah despite being cleared by airport security.
The plane is likely to return to Calicut soon.
The aircraft had been kept as a standby for the recent US visit of Modi. The Prime Minister had undertaken a five-day visit to the US from September 25.

Officials in a fix after withdrawal of notification regarding the constitution of the Planning Commission

(The dismal state of affairs…)
NEW DELHI: Careers of several senior bureaucrats of the Planning Commission have been in limbo since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address, sounded the death knell for the 64-year old institution that formulated five-year plans and influenced policy decisions during its heyday.
The promotion of a joint advisor, who has had a record of outstanding performance throughout his career, has got stuck at the highest level while another senior officer, who has put in 10 years in the commission, has been waiting for her cadre to place her out. "My promotion within the commission was cleared by the top brass here but got stuck at the Cabinet level because the government has decided to wind up the institution itself. This is despite an outstanding performance each year in more than two decades of service," the joint advisor told ET on condition of anonymity.
The dismal state of affairs is evident in the corridors of Yojana Bhawan, headquarters of the commission, where officers have neither much work nor any growth prospects in sight. "I have been requesting my cadre to take me out of the commission, but they are waiting to see what the new government does with the several economic service officers working here," said an advisor in the commission.
The Cabinet declared last month that the notification regarding the constitution of the Planning Commission stands withdrawn. There are at least 200 officers, at the rank of advisors, joint advisors and directors, in the commission out of the total staff strength of nearly 1,000. "No ministry officials are now seeking our views on the draft Cabinet notes. It is only the final Cabinet note that comes to us, that too very rarely, leave alone our views on policy matters," another advisor in the commission said.According to several officers, the most disappointing thing is that even the planning secretary Sindhushree Khullar has not even once, directly or indirectly conveyed to them that she will stand by her team to ensure that all members are well placed.
"She is in the Prime Minister's Office several times a day, almost every day, but not even once has she communicated with us on what lies ahead for us," said an officer, requesting not to be named. The PMO has roped in Khullar to resolve interministerial issues of infrastructure and sanitation. She has presented all infrastructure reviews in the past four months and played a key role in the roll-out of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on Thursday.
Khullar did not respond to an email query sent by ET.NC Saxena, a former secretary of the Planning Commission said that the officers, being government employees, need not worry for their salaries even if they did not have much work in the interim period. "However, since the new institution is likely to be thinner, they will either have to go back to their cadres or get absorbed in other ministries," he said.
Although the government has sought suggestions of experts and public as well as the erstwhile commission through a Cabinet note, it is yet to firm up its view on the new institution that will replace the commission. Arun Maira, member in the previous commission said that the government ought to act fast or else it might have to backtrack on the idea.
"The government needs to quickly define the structure of the new institution and figure out how much of its manpower requirement could be fulfilled by the existing officials," he said. "The inertia in the existing system is so strong that if you delay the process for long there is a possibility that the government will have to reverse its decision or we may end up getting a diluted version of the institution envisaged by them," Maira added, citing the example of the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO). The IEO was set up through a Cabinet order after the approval of the National Development Council.
However, the Modi-led NDA government, which took charge in May, closed down the IEO and decided to strengthen the Programme Evaluation Organisation, which has existed since 1952. The Planning Commission played a key role, most recently during the tenure of the previous UPA government, largely because of the closeness between its then deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and then PM Manmohan Singh.
 
The institution, which determined allocation of planned funds to states, influenced policy decisions especially with regard to infrastructure sectors. This resulted in a lot of discontent among various ministries that often criticised the commission for its overarching role. Ahluwalia could not be reached for comment.

Tensions surge in Hong Kong protestsUpdated: October 5, 2014 01:25 IST
Back to work from Monday, says Hong Kong chief

TOPICS
There was no visible change in the balance of street power in Hong Kong on Saturday, but tensions seemed to rise following a declaration by authorities that the process of restoring normality in the territory will commence on Monday.
Schools to reopen
In an evening televised address, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying announced that government operations in Hong Kong, which is designated as China’s Special Administrative Region (SAR), would commence on Monday. He said schools, shuttered since September 28, when the protests commenced, would also be opened on the same day.
“At the moment, the most urgent thing is that all entrances and exits of the SAR government’s headquarters must be kept clear on Monday, so all 3,000 government staff can work normally and serve citizens,” said Mr. Leung. “And roads in Central and Western and Wan Chai districts will no longer be blocked so all schools can resume classes on Monday.”
The decision of the government to get proactive, follows two developments — the inability to start talks with the protesters, and the rise in street power of groups opposing Occupy Central, the name given to the student-led agitation that has descended on three sensitive locations of the city. By Saturday, there was a strong possibility that the locality of Mong Kok, a congested residential and working class area, could become the platform for the launch of counter-protests.
Arrests after clashes
There were violent clashes in the area a day earlier between groups for and against the agitation resulting in 19 arrests and injuries to at least 20 people, including six police officers. After the overnight violence, I Care Action, an anti-Occupy Central group, held a rally in Mong Kok, where one of its leaders exhorted the police to forcibly evict the protesters.
“Occupying the roads is nothing about democracy. It’s to destroy Hong Kong people’s daily life,” he said. “We want our harmonious society back. We want to go to work, we want to go to school.”
The government’s unilateral decision to resurrect normality follows expression of full support in Beijing for the actions, including the use of tear gas last Sunday, by authorities in Hong Kong.
A second successive commentary on Saturday in the People’s Daily, the government’s official newspaper, observed that tear gas was used when protesters assaulted police defences. “Hong Kong police are very professional, and the actions they took were necessary, appropriate and moderate. There are no reasons to criticise their law enforcement acts”.
Despite the growing assertion by the government, the protesters were present in substantial numbers but significantly below their peak on Tuesday, at Causeway Bay — a top shopping area — as well as around the Admiralty — a major administrative hub that includes the CE’s office.

Washington:US President Barack Obama has strongly condemned the "brutal murder" of British national Alan Henning, and vowed to bring to justice those who were responsible for it.
"The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning by the terrorist group ISIL," Obama said.
Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family and the people of the UK, he said.
"The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning by the terrorist group ISIL," Obama said.

"Standing together with our UK friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice," he added.
"Standing together with a broad coalition of allies and partners, we will continue taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL," Obama said.
The 47-year-old from Manchester in northwest England had volunteered to help drive an aid convoy to Syria for a Muslim charity, and was kidnapped 10 months ago.
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group.

Lifelong visa for PIOs to boost inbound tourism

Lifelong visa
(The US has been an important…)
NEW DELHI: Inbound tourism is likely to get a boost following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of lifelong visa for People of Indian Origin (PIO) in the United States . Modi had said on his recent visit to the US that PIO cardholders would be given lifelong visas while Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) schemes would be combined to simplify the process to come to India.
"If the processes are simplified and huge bureaucratic delays are reduced, it could easily have a short- to medium-term impact on tourist inflows from the US," said Arjun Sharma, managing director of Le Passage to India, a bespoke travel agency that gets nearly 15% of its business from US-based clients.
The US has been an important source of travellers to India since a large number of PIOs visit the country to meet their friends and family every year. Lifelong visas could add significantly to both organised and unorganised travel.
"People visiting just friends and family may want to plan longer holidays built into additional travel itineraries once this policy is implemented and this could give us up to 10% growth," Sharma said.
According to tourism ministry data, India received 6.97 million tourists in 2013, 5.9% more than the previous year. India gets over a million tourists each year from the US, which accounts for nearly 16% of the total inflow into the country.
Tourists often complain about India's antiquated visa policies, including those applicable to PIOs. "It will be great for the Indians in the US who want to plan a last-minute trip back home as access to India will now get easier. The system will allow spontaneous travel," said Rajeev Kohli, joint managing director of Creative Travel India, which gets nearly 20% of its business from the US. Earlier this month, the ministry had identified 50 tourist circuits for development including cruise tourism for Goa, core Buddhist circuit and pilgrimage circuits including ghats of Varanasi, among others, inthe hope of doubling foreign tourist arrivals in the coming years.
Speed of implementation will be the key. "In the short term, it will give India great press and will deliver home the message that India is receptive to international tourism.
The industry is, however, in a waitand-watch situation till the e-visa scheme is implemented," said Vikram Madhok, managing director of Abercrombie & Kent India.
He added that 2015-16 could prove to be the year of revival for India's tourism industry.

NCP releases manifesto; announces freebies if voted to powerFreebies
(Many of the NCP’s promises…)
MUMBAI: From promising pension to farmers and landless agricultural labourers over the age of 65 to free laptops to students who have cleared their 12th standard to building an Islamic cultural centre near Mumbai, the NCP manifesto that was revealed on Thursday seemed to have it all but yet contained nothing of substance.
NCP State Chief Sunil Tatkare on Thursday revealed the Party's manifesto that was filled with many promises and assurances along with some freebies . The party promised that if voted to power it would build a monorail at Aurangabad, Nashik and Nagpur.
The NCP has promised to reimburse the medical bills up to Rs 3 lakh for the poor admitted to hospitals. Earlier the state government used to reimburse Rs 1.5 lakh of the medical bills.
Every student who has cleared his 12th exams would be eligible or a free laptop. Universities would also have a free Wifi service and every class room in the state would be a 'digitally smart class' Many of the NCP's promises seemed to cater to the rural populace, for instance the manifesto promises, 'wholesome and healthy food' priced at only Rs 20 at all State Transport bus stands.
Many of the NCP's promises lacked details for instance the manifesto promised that farmers, labourers and landless agriculural workers over 65 years would be given a pension.
However, there is no mention of the amount that would be given as pension or even whether the payment would be a monthly pension or just a one time payment. Similarly, farmers have been promised that they would get crop insurance, however again there are no details.
'Pucca houses' have been promised to slum dwellers in Mumbai who have settled in the city prior to January 1, 2000.

Google planning to launch own mobile messaging app similar to WhatsApp

(Google reportedly made…)
BANGALORE: After losing WhatsApp to Facebook in a multibillion dollar acquisition bid, Google is planning to launch its own mobile messaging app which the search giant is likely to test in India and other emerging markets. Last month, Google sent top product manager Nikhyl Singhal to India to do a recce of the messaging app ecosystem in the country as the company looks to catch up on an opportunity it lost to others.
The Google messenger is in early stages of development and is likely to be launched in 2015, sources aware of the plans said. A Google spokesperson, however, declined to comment. Google reportedly made an offer of over $10 billion (Rs 60,000 crore) to buy Whatsapp, the instant messaging app which was ultimately bought by Facebook for $19 billion Rs 1.2 lakh crore) in one of the largest technology deals.
Singhal, who is a product management director for Hangouts, Photos, Google+ core & Platform, is also touring other countries in Asia Pacific to understand local ecosystems better.
Unlike other Google products, the messenger will not force users to use their Google login. The company is also considering loalising the product by adding Indian language support and voiceto-text messaging. The messenger will also be free to use. WhatsApp, which will be its biggest competitor, has a freemium model where it charges Rs 53 annually after one year.
With the launch of its Android One initiative, which sought to bring together hardware vendors to sell affordable smartphones, India is increasingly becoming a testing ground for Google. In an interview with ET last month, top Google executive Sun-dar Pichai said the company wants to do more India specific launches because of the scale and scope of the market.
India is expected to become the world's second-largest smartphone market after China by 2019. For Google, the move comes a little late as other instant messengers like Viber, WeChat and Line have also created sizeable user bases.
"Google would agree that it missed social and missed social on mobile. But then Facebook had to buy WhatsApp and Instagram for the same reason," said Benedict Evans, former mobile analyst and a partner at Andreessen Horowitz in an email to ET.India is one of the fastest-growing markets for instant messaging applications. Of the 600 million WhatsApp users, 65 million are in India.
Similarly, Line has over 18 million registered users, Viber is targeting 30 million users by the year end and homegrown messenger Hike claims over 35 million registered users. WeChat doesn't share country specific data but globally, it has over 438 million monthly active users.
"Around four years ago, there were at least close to 15 messaging apps with over 1 million daily active users and that didn't include Whatsapp," said Aakrit Vaish, who quit his job at mobile analytics company Flurry to launch Haptik, an instant messaging-based app that answers customer queries.
Haptik, which raised $1 million (Rs 6 crore) venture capital funds last month, saw over 100,000 customer queries in less than 15 days on the app. "It also helps because it is free," said Vaish.
Mobile connections in India will grow to 815 million in 2014, up 8% from last year, according to Gartner which counted the growing appetite for over the top voice services (data based) as one of the 'biggest challenges' faced by Indian mobile operators.

Facebook changes real-name policy on social network  allows aliasesSave precious time tracking your investments
BANGALORE: Facebook said it would change its policy requiring users to go by their real names on the social network , following outrage over the locking of hundreds of accounts, including a number belonging to drag queens using their stage names.
Facebook's product chief, Christopher Cox, apologised in a post on Wednesday and said the affected users could go back to using their aliases. The world's largest social media network had locked scores of accounts in recent weeks, including hundreds belonging to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
"The spirit of our policy is that everyone on Facebook uses the authentic name they use in real life. For Sister Roma, that's Sister Roma. For Lil Miss Hot Mess, that's Lil Miss Hot Mess," Cox wrote, denying that the company's policy required users to go by their legal names. San Francisco drag queens and a city lawmaker met with Facebook representatives in September to demand that the site change its policy of banning users from going by aliases online.
Drag queen performers, or men who dress in flamboyant female clothing for nightclub shows, usually use stage names that have no relation to their real names. Performers say using their stage names on social media protects them from possible retribution from other employers, family members and stalkers.
Facebook had said earlier that it would give users two weeks to adjust their profiles to display their real name or convert their personal pages into fan pages that allow the use of nicknames.

Despite the number of free, awesome note-taking apps any smartphone-owning person can lay their hands on, Post-Its are still probably the most popular way to jot down a quick reminder.
In an effort to make their flagship product more digital and down with the productivity-focused kids, 3M has released an app to help digitise your scribbles.
The Post-It Plus app is a free download for iOS, and basically lets you photograph all your Post-Its, then organise them on a digital cork-board for your perusing pleasure. The capture is pretty straightforward: you can take one photo of multiple notes, and then the app will identify and add them all as separate Post-Its onto the board.
In reality, you need to be taking photos in decent light, with none of the Post-Its overlapping, but as long as you meet that (pretty low) bar, you should be good to go.
Once you've got your Post-Its into the app, drag them around and organise, before exporting (if you want to) to PDFs, Evernote, or the MS Office suite.
It's a pretty nifty attempt to make the ultimate in analogue tools more digital; whether or not it beats abusing the edge of your screen with a million multicolored note remains to be seen.

Foreign investment policy for Limited Liability Partnerships under reviewForeign investment policy for Limited Liability Partnerships under review

Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion
(LLPs have emerged as a preferred…)
NEW DELHI: The government is set to follow up on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise of rolling out the red carpet to foreign investors by allowing them to invest in sectors on the automatic route without prior approval through Limited Liability Partnerships or LLPs while sectors on the approval route could also be thrown open with some conditions.
"The foreign investment policy for LLPs is being reviewed. There is a need to align with the policy for companies," said a government official, privy to the development.
Modi, on his recent visit to the United States, reiterated his promise to foreign investors to provide a non-adversarial regime that would be minus the proverbial red tape. The NDA government , which took over in May, is holding consultations to further liberalise foreign direct investment (FDI) norms for the construction and development sector, after it threw open railways and eased rules for the defence sector.
LLPs have emerged as a preferred mode of investments owing to the flexibility they offer in terms of compliance and are a popular vehicle the world over especially for manufacturing, IT, hospitality, advertising and consultancy. The government is now looking at more structural cleaning up to remove unnecessary niggles that may be holding up foreign investors, for LLPs face multiple restrictions even as they are just another business organisations.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion is in advanced stage of discussions with ministries of finance and corporate affairs on an FDI regime for LLPs that will be on a par with that for companies.
FDI is not allowed in partnership firms.
The RBI has already given its goahead to the proposed move but wants disclosures about control and ownership in sectors that are on the approval route.
LLPs will have to disclose the interest of all partners when it seeks approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, the official cited earlier said.
LLPs operating in sectors that allow 100% FDI on the automatic route, sans any conditions, may also be able to invest downstream.
India had in 2009 allowed LLPs, which are business organisations with lesser statutory requirements than companies.
However, foreigners have been allowed to use the structure only since 2011 with many restrictions. Foreigners can float LLPs only in sectors in which 100% FDI is allowed and that too with prior approval since the government wanted a calibrated opening up with regard to a new form of business organisation.
"The idea initially was to prevent any misuse," the official added.

India  US to share a list of citizens involved in terror hubsIndia, US to share list of citizens in terror hubs

The Indian Ocean Dialogue will be held between India and the US to feed into the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) summit to be held in Perth next week.

NEW DELHI: India and the US will exchange information on their respective citizens who may be going off to Syria, Iraq or any other new terror hotspot. As one of the agreements reached between the counter-terror organizations of both countries in Washington, India and the US will exchange lists of foreign terrorists and terror watchlists.
This agreement is significant. While counterterrorism cooperation between India and the US was ramped up after the Mumbai attacks (2008), this agreement is a deeper look at how each country tracks potential and fully fledged terrorists, both who are citizens and those who may be transiting, like the Indian-origin "recruiter" from Singapore.
The US has been battling a home-grown terror threat as well, including the fact that hundreds of its citizens have apparently joined the deadly ISIS in Iraq. India has been tracking 20 of its citizens who have gone over to fight (though some sources quote a higher figure). The intelligence cooperation will stretch to the defence forces who will now exchange their own sets of information and intelligence.
India is silent on joining the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, but the war on extremism is very much an Indian aim. But India takes a less militaristic approach than the US, partly because of its lesser capacity and partly because of its domestic sensitivities.
The enhanced security cooperation with the US shows the active engagement of national security adviser Ajit Doval, who has been pushing this cooperation. Doval stayed back in the US to take this forward.
The US will also sell the famous MRAP vehicles to India to counter IEDs. Indian officials are looking to use this in the Maoist-hit areas for security forces who are frequently killed in landmine and IED blasts. (US has just agreed to give many of these to Pakistan as well.) India is also looking for new technology to tackle the rash of counterfeit currency that comes into India from Pakistani sources through Nepal and Bangladesh.
The Indian Ocean Dialogue will be held between India and the US to feed into the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) summit to be held in Perth next week. India is very sensitive about the Indian Ocean being its strategic backyard, and recent moves by China to send submarines into the Indian Ocean has put the Indian Navy on alert.
For the first time, the US has offered India high grade technology for the next generation of Indian Navy vessels. The Navy, according to sources, is in the process of building over 40 different classes of warships and destroyers. Indian officials say this is a first, putting a new layer to the defence relationship.
On the business end, Boeing recently signed a deal in Bangalore to build part of the mainframe of the Chinook helicopters in India as well as some sustainable components for the C-17 aircraft, this, before the Chinook deal is finalized. Sources said GE is opening a new manufacture and skilling-integrated plant in Pune in November.

RateGain
FOUNDER : Bhanu Chopra
Bhanu Chopra drives a white Porsche Panamera to his office in Noida. That is, when he is not jetting around the world meeting customers and drumming up support for the proposed public issue of shares at his enterprise software firm RateGain.
Although Chopra can seem like the archetypal technology entrepreneur riding high on risk capital funding, the 38-year-old entrepreneur has not raised a single rupee in venture capital. The decade-old company, which sells software for the hospitality and travel industries in 120 countries, is aiming for a share sale on Nasdaq that could value it at around Rs 6,000 crore. Chopra, who is the largest stakeholder, has also given stock options to several of his 350 employees.
"I can't pretend to be frugal. I drive a nice car, travel business class and am still bootstrapped," said Chopra, who pays senior executives at his firm an average salary of about Rs 1 crore per annum. When starting up has become synonymous with raising copious amounts of capital, contrarians like Chopra and ZohoCorporation's founder Sridhar Vembu are emerging as torchbearers of the bootstrapped approach. Vembu's Zoho, with over $100 million (Rs 600 crore) in revenue, competes against the likes of Microsoft in the enterprise software market. "Bootstrapping embraces the notion that to the extent that the future is shaped by human action, it is not much use trying to predict it," said Saras D Sarasvathy, professor of entrepreneurship at University of Virginia Darden School of Business. Around 73% of software product companies in India are bootstrapped, according to software product think tank iSpirt.
The grouping has launched an initiative 'BootUpIndia' to recognise India's best bootstrapped startups that will subsequently be mentored by industry peers. ET profiles eight bootstrapped startups which have the potential to be the next big winners.
EmployWise
FOUNDER : Sumeet Kapur
Sumeet Kapur's first startup, a venture capital-backed customer relationship management solutions firm, went through a tough time during the dot com bubble burst in 2000. "The burn rate was high, even if you applied brakes, you were burning," said Kapur, 50, who had to start again from scratch and started to work on the human resources software product in 2006. With funding being scarce, bootstrapping became a necessity for him. But it enabled the product to evolve based on the feedback from the customers.
"It would have been a waterfall if I had raised the capital and built the product in one shot," says Kapur. "I didn't want to experiment with investor money. "Unlike his first venture, EmployWise was also able to whether the economic meltdown of 2008 as it was not dependent on venture capital. The EmployWise product is now being used by 50,000 employees across various sectors including technology, retail and manufacturing. But Kapur had to apply extra effort to build the firm due to which he was not able to spend more time with his family. "But I have an extremely supportive family," said Kapur who likes taking his dog for a long walk every morning.
WHAT THEY DO: Hire-to-Retire human resources software delivered off the cloud in the software as a service model

SEED CAPITAL: Rs 1 crore
REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2014: Not disclosed

Customer engagement was a new term for a large number of mom and pop shops - until Anand Krushnan jumped in to sell software to small shops and bring back those customers that crossed their threshold. Since early 2013, the team of 150 employees has covered 1,500 shops across India and has been frugal in doing so. By working out of his exemployers office, called Tangence, Krushnan has eliminated all costs related to infrastructure. Bootstrapped entrepreneurs have it worse than funded ones is a notion that Krushnan disagrees with. "Whatever you do, you can't be stressed. I play badminton every day, and work for 12 hours a day. That's how it has always been," said Krushnan, 39 a graduate of at GM Institute of Technology, Chitradurga.

Failure is the key to becoming an entrepreneur: Ashish HemrajaniAshish Hemrajani
(The 40-year-old founder…)
AHMEDABAD: Failure is essential to the making of an entrepreneur , believes Ashish Hemrajani , founder of Book My Show. Hemrajani turned convention on its head while addressing final year post-graduate students at the premier institute Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, at the first stopover of The Economic Times Young Leaders B-School Edition on Thursday.
"Indian society looks upon failure as the end of your career. Actually, it's the beginning," he said. The 40-year-old founder and CEO of India's biggest online ticketing company, has known his share of failure, but has refused to be cowed down by it.
He survived two dotcom busts and a personal tragedy. Today, his company is valued at over Rs 2,000 crore. "I did not know where my next salary or meal would come from, but I did not fear failure," said Hemrajani.
Failure, he said, goes hand in hand with risk. "All these years that you have been successful, failure has been risky. But why not try doing different things in life," he said. After having finally tasted success, he says he now has the satisfaction as well as the flexibility to do what he really wants to.
"I enjoy boat sailing, beach and many more things in life," he added. An entrepreneurial mindset helps one to be a leader in whatever one does.
"And for that, you need to have the guts to fail," he said. "Entrepreneurship is a state of mind - it's not about starting a new business. You can be an entrepre neur while being in a job - by taking a calculated risk and trying something new," he said.
His definition of leadership included a long list of qualities. Curiosity, the ability to foresee, team building, the ability to mingle with the team, give direction, chart out a constant path, think out of the box and work on it, get yourself involved in field work to know the pulse of your customers, be decisive, have reality checks.
And most important, "to accomplish this, have no fear of failure," he said. He still involves himself with field work, if only to experience the situation on the ground. This helps him plan, keeping the organisation's best interests in mind. Today, Book My Show holds a 90% market share in the online entertainment ticketing space.
Hemrajani started his career in 1997 at J Walter Thompson after completing his Masters in Business Administration from Mumbai University. He quit the job after two years and started Bigtree Entertainment in 1999.
Hemrajani focused on providing cutting-edge digital solutions to the entertainment industry. The decision wan't an easy one. "My parents were angry. At that point of time, selling cinema tickets was not considered respectable," he says.
But in the end, his decision to stay the course paid off. It was a risk he took, "without fearing failure," he says.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA: Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator (YC), known as a boot camp for startups, was chosen to head the famed Silicon Valley accelerator by founder & entrepreneur Paul Graham earlier this year. Graham, while anointing his successor, wrote in a blog post that Sam is what YC needs at this stage in its evolution. Altman co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking mobile app, which was part of the first YC startup class in 2005, and had been a part-time YC partner since 2011. YC's portfolio companies have a combined valuation of over $30 billion with the likes of Dropbox, Airbnb, Reddit, among others, using the accelerator as a launch pad. Altman told TOI that YC was making efforts to actively engage with founders beyond the Valley and India is one such market. Excerpts from an interview...
Starting this fall, you'll be teaching a class at Stanford on how to start up, which will be available online. What's the reason for doing this now?
We want this information to be accessible to anyone in the world, so the classes will be available online for anyone to watch for free. We'll talk about how to come up with ideas and evaluate them, how to get users and grow, how to do sales and marketing, how to hire, how to raise money, company culture, operations and management, business strategy, and more. You can't teach everything necessary to succeed in starting a company, but I suspect we can teach a surprising amount. We're doing this because we believe helping a lot of people be better at starting companies will be good for everyone.
How's YC different from other startup accelerators?
YC pioneered the accelerator model. Twice a year, we invest a small amount of money ($120,000) in a large number of startups (most recently 68).The startups move to Silicon Valley for three months, during which we work intensively with them to get the company into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors. We have almost 1,500 alumni - many of them very successful - and within that group there are experts in just about every domain. On top of getting access to advice from the partners, YC startups also have a vast support system of founders who act as mentors to each other.
YC funded ClearTax this summer, which is catering to the Indian market. What's the interest around startups coming out of India from investors here?
We've so far funded four Indian startups - HackerRank, TapToLearn, Plivo and ClearTax. The important thing to note here is that investors are interested in companies that are making things for the Indian market. The other companies we've funded which had Indian founders were making products for the global market. We had 12 founders in Summer 2014 batch who reported that India was their country of origin.

I love the energy that Mumbai has as well as the people. I love how it is actually very relaxed; it's kind of like an Eastern Los Angeles really. Of course, it is crowded, especially when you travel from South to North. Bombay is many things - there's still a colonial heart to town and Walkeshwar. Bombay Gym is another country all together.
Bandra is very hip and connected and is a lovely place to live. There are lots of places to eat and I have a lot of fun here. I am happy I moved out of Lokhandwala which is a nightmare honestly - there's just too much traffic.
I also love the fact that it is open late at night - you can pretty much get anything done at any time of the day or night. Your internet can get sorted with just a phone call. I think Delhi in comparison is slightly more sedate.
I know and love both places however. If there's anything I don't love... well, the road to Film City has just too much traffic. However, I see the city get cleaner and better. This is the first government I have heard talking about toilets and topics like this which is really important. So, yes, I want the city to be clean. I want better infrastructure when it comes to sewage, especially in Lokhandwala where there are still open sewers and mosquitoes.
Now, even well-to-do successful people are getting dengue, so we all better clean up. I have never voted and that's because I have never felt that I am being represented. Now I feel I am and I am also a supporter of Modi's government.
It's the first time we have had such a big majority. There is no excuse for not trying to achieve special things. I like the noises that the government is making. I like the way everyone is feeling. I am really of the fact that everyone in India thinks differently and nobody is on the same page. Everyone is scared and thinks, 'What will happen to the Muslims' and this and that.
And we never get anywhere. This is one time where I feel that everyone should just fall in line. But, we should not expect miracles at the same time and then condemn the government.
I don't know if I am going to vote for the assembly polls but by the time the next election comes around, I might even campaign for what I believe in. In fact, Ritesh Deshmuk has taught me about government and elections and he said it well when he said that this last election would be thought of as a stirrer; in the sense that all our political consciences would get a little stirred and that we would have to decide where we stand.
This is something we have not done before.

Goldman Sachs considering setting up new infra fundGoldman Sachs Group considering setting up new infrastructure fund
Greg Roumeliotis     New York   Last Updated: October 3, 2014  | 15:09 IST

Goldman Sachs Group is considering raising a new infrastructure fund, according to three people familiar with the matter, even as US regulations threaten to reduce its profits from such endeavors.
The bank's plans are tentative and in the early stages, and there is currently no fundraising process or target size for the fund, the sources cautioned. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
When Goldman last raised an infrastructure fund in 2010, it met with lukewarm demand. Like that fund, the one being envisaged would have a global focus with a mandate to buy a variety of infrastructure assets, such as airports, power grids and toll roads.
In recent years investors such as pensions and insurers have grown increasingly keen on infrastructure funds, as they look for assets that are safer than stocks but offer better returns than low-yielding bonds.
Under a federal regulation known as the "Volcker Rule," part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, a bank cannot own more than 3 percent of an infrastructure fund or any other private equity-type fund. The regulation is meant to limit banks' bets on risky assets.
Before the Volcker rule, Goldman would typically invest around 10 per cent of the capital in an infrastructure fund it set up and 30 to 35 percent of its private equity funds .
There is a loophole in the rule, though. A bank can spend as much of its own money as it likes to buy infrastructure assets like roads and airports, or invest in the kinds of corporate assets owned by private equity firms, provided it doesn't use a fund that includes outside investors.
The bank is taking that route with private equity, as Reuters first reported last year. For example, it is currently leading a deal to acquire Neovia Logistics LLC, which helps companies with inventory management and warehousing, Reuters reported last week.
But the bank is reluctant to use that loophole for infrastructure assets, because the potential returns are usually only about half the 18 to 20 percent it can earn from private equity investments. The bank will earn a management fee and likely a 20 percent cut of fund profits, but will not earn much in the way of additional returns given the 3 percent limit on its investment.
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
Infrastructure assets, such as ports, toll roads and airports, may offer lower returns than private equity investments, but they are also lower risk, because they typically operate through government-granted monopolies.
Signs that Goldman is going to make most of its infrastructure investments with other peoples' money, while making riskier private equity investments with its own money, underscore how the Volcker rule may have unintended consequences.
The rule was designed to make banks safer, but it may be encouraging banks to focus their own money on riskier assets, instead of making bets on a range of assets from the relatively safe to the risky.
Goldman Sachs is thinking about its next infrastructure fund now in part because its second and most recent such fund, raised before the Volcker rule in 2010, has invested about 65 percent of the capital pledged to it, one of the sources said. (The fund sought to raise about $7.5 billion, but ended up getting less than half that.) Managers of alternative investments like infrastructure funds typically begin raising a new vehicle when the previous fund is about 75 per cent invested.
U.S. banks have taken varied approaches to infrastructure funds after the Volcker rule. Citigroup Inc, for example, is winding down its infrastructure investment unit, while Morgan Stanley is currently aiming to raise $4 billion for an infrastructure fund. It has so far raised more than $1.5 billion, it said in regulatory filings in July.
Strong demand has helped the average size of infrastructure funds raised so far this year increase by 44 per cent compared with the corresponding period in 2013, according to market research firm Preqin.

After Apple and Google  Facebook now forays into healthcare sectorOct 03, 2014 at 03:58pm IST
After Apple and Google, Facebook now forays into healthcare sector

San Francisco: Facebook already knows who your friends are and the kind of things that grab your attention. Soon, it could also know the state of your health.
On the heels of fellow Silicon Valley technology companies Apple Inc and Google Inc, Facebook is plotting its first steps into the fertile field of healthcare, said three people familiar with the matter. The people requested anonymity as the plans are still in development.
The company is exploring creating online "support communities" that would connect Facebook users suffering from various ailments. A small team is also considering new "preventative care" applications that would help people improve their lifestyles.

In recent months, the sources said, the social networking giant has been holding meetings with medical industry experts and entrepreneurs, and is setting up a research and development unit to test new health apps. Facebook is still in the idea-gathering stage, the people said.
Healthcare has historically been an area of interest for Facebook, but it has taken a backseat to more pressing products.
Recently, Facebook executives have come to realise that healthcare might work as a tool to increase engagement with the site.
One catalyst: the unexpected success of Facebook's "organ-donor status initative," introduced in 2012. The day that Facebook altered profile pages to allow members to specify their organ donor-status, 13,054 people registered to be organ donors online in the United States, a 21 fold increase over the daily average of 616 registrations, according to a June 2013 study published in the American Journal of Transplantation.
Separately, Facebook product teams noticed that people with chronic ailments such as diabetes would search the social networking site for advice, said one former Facebook insider. In addition, the proliferation of patient networks such as PatientsLikeMe demonstrate that people are increasingly comfortable sharing symptoms and treatment experiences online.
Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg may step up his personal involvement in health. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, a pediatric resident at University of California San Francisco, recently donated $5 million to the Ravenswood Health Center in East Palo Alto.
Any advertising built around the health initiatives would not be as targeted as it could be on television or other media. Pharmaceutical companies, for instance, are prohibited from using Facebook to promote the sale of prescription drugs, in part because of concerns surrounding disclosures.
Privacy concerns
Privacy, an area where the company has faced considerable criticism over the years, will likely prove a challenge. This week, the company apologized to users for manipulating news feeds for the purposes of research.
But Facebook may already have a few ideas to alleviate privacy concerns around its health initiatives. The company is considering rolling out its first health application quietly and under a different name, a source said. Market research commissioned by Facebook found that many of its users were unaware that photo-service Instagram is Facebook-owned, the source said.
Facebook's recent softening of its policy requiring users to go by their real names may also bolster the company's health plans. People with chronic conditions may prefer to use an alias when sharing their health experiences.
"I could see Facebook doing well with applications for lifestyle and wellness, but really sick patients with conditions like cancer aren't fooling around," said Frank Williams, chief executive of Evolent Health, a company that provides software and services to doctors and health systems.
People would need anonymity and an assurance that their data and comments wouldn't be shared with their online contacts, advertisers, or pharmaceutical companies, Williams said.
It remains unclear whether Facebook will moderate or curate the content shared in the support communities, or bring in outside medical experts to provide context.
Facebook declined to comment on its health care plans.

US Jobless Rate at 6-Year Low of 5.9%You are here: Home Economy
US Jobless Rate Lowest in Six Years; Dollar Rises
Reuters | Updated On: October 03, 2014 20:28 (IST)
Government to Streamline Subsidies, Cheap LPG for Rich May Go: Finance Minister
London: A strong improvement in the US jobs market lifted the dollar to a four-year high against a basket of currencies on Friday while stocks also extended gains, taking heart from more evidence of a sustained recovery in the world's largest economy.
Closely followed non-farm payrolls data for September showed US employers had added 248,000 jobs, up from an upwardly revised 180,000 the previous month and beating forecasts of the 215,000 economists polled by Reuters had predicted beforehand. The jobless rate fell to a six-year low of 5.9 per cent.
Wall Street futures extended gains while the dollar hit a fresh four-year high of 86.498. US short-term interest-rate futures contracts fell and traders boosted bets the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates slightly earlier in 2015.
"Just when investors had been becoming nervous about global growth prospects with October so far seeing a broad sell-off in equity markets, today's non-farm payrolls figure could put a line in the sand for the indices," said Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FXPro.
This week has seen stocks, oil and other commodity markets suffer their biggest slump in months on worries about growth, political unrest and looming US interest rate rises and their impact on the dollar.
Dollar bulls, who have pushed the currency to a four-year high this week, had been counting on the robust jobs report following some healthy signals already this week.
Brent crude futures fell to $92.20 a barrel, trading near their lowest since 2012, with the overall tone quite bearish, amid ample supply.
Gold fell 1.3 per cent to a nine-month low of $1,197.95/oz while copper prices ticked up after hitting five-month lows the session before.
European bourses extended their earlier gains, rising 1 per cent.
The euro fell to a two-year low against the dollar, a day after the European Central Bank disappointed the markets on Thursday and triggered the biggest sell-off in over a year in markets like Italy.

We need to discover ourselves again: Modigovernment
PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation over radio for the first time and promised to make it a regular affair
In his first address to the nation, christened Man ki Baat (my thoughts) Prime Minister Narendra Modi adopted an anecdotal style and punctuated his broadcast with a story, and couple of inputs he received from the public to drive home the message that India does not lack talent. “We have just lost our way, and we need to discover ourselves again.”
Mr Modi also informed his listeners that from now on his address would be on Sundays at 11 a.m. though the periodicity of these addresses has not be finalized.
As per an analysis of the responses received at the Open Forum for the Prime Minister’s Radio Address, 46.18 per cent of respondents suggested that he make this a monthly affair.
The Prime Minister advocated the use of khaadi by everyone.
“I am not asking you to be a ‘khaadi-dhaari’ (wear only khaadi) but one item of your daily use – maybe, something as small as a handkerchief – should be made out of ‘khaadi’.” While pitching for khaadi, he reminded listeners that khaadi would be available at a discount all this month because of Gandhi Jayanti.
I really liked what he wrote. I remember we began Khel Mahakumbh for specially abled athletes & I myself would go & see the sports: PM

32 people killed in stampede in Patna Dussehra event32 people killed in stampede in Patna Dussehra event
PTI
PM sanctions Rs 2 lakh each for next of kin of those killed
Patna, Oct 3:  
Thirty-two people, most of them women and children, were killed and several injured in a stampede that broke out this evening at the Gandhi Maidan here shortly after the Dussehra celebrations.
The tragedy occurred when people were returning after watching the “Ravan Vadh” ceremony at the Bihar capital’s main Dussehra event at Gandhi Maidan where a huge crowd had gathered to witness the event, police said.
“Thirty-two people have died,” Bihar Home Secretary Amir Subhani said.
Officials said the dead were mainly women and children.
Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manji was present at the Gandhi Maidan where people watched an arrow setting the 60 feet tall effigy of Ravan into flames.
Ex gratia
Condoling the loss of lives in the Patna stampede, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sanctioned an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the next of kin of those killed in the incident.
He also sanctioned Rs 50,000 for each of the critically injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.
Modi spoke to Bihar Chief Minister Manjhi over telephone this evening and reviewed the situation arising out of the stampede.
Bihar government blamed
Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan blamed the Bihar government over the Patna stampede incident, saying it failed to learn from the past and put in place measures to prevent the tragedy.
“It is not only an unfortunate and regrettable incident but also shameful. Dussehra festivities take place in Gandhi Maidan every year. Still no appropriate arrangements were made... recently there was an incident during Chhatt puja.
There was an incident during Narendra Modi’s rally in October last year,” Prasad told PTI here.
He was referring to the blasts which rocked Modi’s rally venue.
Prasad said while he has spoken to Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, a team of NDRF has already left for Patna to assist the state administration.
The Law Minister said that the Centre will render all possible assistance to the state government to deal with the situation.
Prasad and Paswan plan to visit Patna tomorrow to take stock of the situation. Both are from Bihar.
Expressing grief, Paswan attacked the JD(U) government in Bihar for allegedly failing to put in place measures to prevent the tragedy.
He said similar incidents had taken place during Chhatt Puja in Bihar but the state government has “failed to learn lessons.”

Mumbai: Government on Friday saw nothing wrong with the state broadcaster Doordarshan telecasting live the hour-long address of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on the ground that the event was "news worthy".
Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said here that Prasar Bharati, under which Doordarshan comes, took its own decisions and that DD news covered the speeches of leaders of Congress and other parties.
The minister maintained that the event was covered by private TV channels also. However, none of the major channels showed the entire speech live.

#mohan bhagwat #rss #doordarshan #prakash javadekar
While Prasar Bharati CEO Jawahar Sircar refused to comment on the issue, Doordarshan DG (News) Archana Dutta said, "It was just like a news event to us. So we covered it."
Javadekar suggested that Doordarshan may not have covered the RSS chief's speech live in the past because of "restrictions" placed by earlier regimes.
"Earlier there may be restrictions that this should not be shown. We have not put any restrictions. So they are covering all news worthy events," he said.
"Prasar Bharati takes its own decisions and I don't know why they were not showing earlier. It's a news worthy event. All private news channels are showing it. Then why DD should be banned?" the I&B minister asked.
He also added that many people wanted to listen to the speech which was widely watched.
When a reporter asked him about how an event that was not covered during the last ten years suddenly became news-worthy for Doordarshan after BJP's coming to power, Javadekar replied that it was due to "trampling" on DD's freedom by earlier UPA regimes that such events were not covered.
He said that at that time the question why RSS chief's speech "was being blocked" should have been asked.

Hotels like Sofitel, Mövenpick, others get innovative, organise various events to boost sales

brunch parties
(Aloft, upscale brand owned…)
MUMBAI: The lights went out at the Wink bar at Mumbai's Vivanta by Taj-President hotel on a bright afternoon last month. As night descended, the bar lounge transformed into a venue for the sort of downtown party brunch that is hosted in New York every Saturday, complete with sparklers, neon drinks, theme menu and bartenders dressed in unique outfits befitting the theme.
"We wanted Mumbai to enjoy a night out on a Saturday afternoon and so we started this brunch party. Every party will be timed with an event or festivity for which we create special menu and ambience is set accordingly," said Pankaj Sampat, general manager of the hotel. With food and beverages, or F&B, accounting for more than half of the revenues and standalone restaurants giving upscale hotels a run for their money, hot tels are trying to exploit the potential of this segment to the fullest and coming up with newer ways to offer more than just good food and heady drinks.
Such events ensure an uptick of 25-30% in food and beverages business for the hotel during the specific days. Hotels are, therefore, turning their restaurants into happening venues with musical events and contests, fashion shows and stand-up comedy shows combined with eclectic menus. Guests walking into Pondichery Cafe at Mumbai's luxury hotel Sofitel were surprised one weekend in May to see the all-day dining restaurant transform into a glitzy fashion-show venue. As the guests savoured fusion cuisine, models elegantly walked around the tables displaying designer Rocky S' latest collection.
"A five-star luxury hotel is not just about sleeping and eating; it's a living organism and a hub of culture," said Biswajit Chakraborty, general manager, Sofitel Hotel at Bandra-Kurla complex,one of Mumbai's big business districts where many big banks and multinational companies have offices. The hotel is now planning to revive supper theatre that will allow guests to watch a play over dinner, he said. Bangalore's Movenpick Hotel recently conducted a standup comedy event by internationally renowned playwright, screenwriter and stand-up comic Anuvab Pal which attracted expats and corporate clients.
"These events help increase footfalls, generate more business for restaurants and also bring new clients for the hotel," said Vinesh Gupta, general manager at Movenpick Hotel. He added that the event helped the hotel earn about Rs 2.5-3 lakh in additional F&B revenue. Hotels are promoting such events through social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, thereby also increasing the brand's visibility. Some hotels are taking these events beyond their restaurants.
Aloft, the upscale brand owned by Starwood Group which is targeted at the young millennial traveller, conducts live musical events in the hotel lobby which is open to public and in-house guests alike. Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park recently hosted a music talent competition called 'Project Aloft Star', which saw participation of over 200 music enthusiasts.
Courtesy the event, the hotel has been growing its network of business and corporate clients. Special events are fast becoming an integral part of business, said Sampat of Vivanta by Taj-President, adding that the number of such events has gone up to 10 annually from about four just three years ago.

Space advances to be used for benefit of humanity: ISRO chief7

Toronto: Rapid technological advances made by India in space will be used for the benefit of humanity, ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan said.
"Space's benefit to the humanity particularly Indian people is our main priority," Radhakrishnan said at a function jointly organised by the Consulate General of India and Canada India Foundation.
The ISRO chairman said that India is already using space technology for communications, telemedicine, long-distance education and information dissemination, monitoring weather and helping authorities respond to natural and made-made disasters.
Radhakrishnan said ISRO would also launch a number of Indian navigation satellites that would improve GPS services over the sub-continent.
#isro #satellite #isro chief #k radhakrishnan
Radhakrishnan, who was here to attend the 65th International Astronautical Congress which concluded today, said that India is building the world's most high-resolution civilian-operated Earth Observation satellite.
He said ISRO would also launch a number of Indian navigation satellites that would improve GPS services over the sub-continent.
As part of its aspirations to build a regional navigational system equivalent to Global Positioning System of the US, ISRO plans to send seven satellites to put in place the Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS).
On the success of ISRO's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), Radhakrishnan said, "It was a historic moment for everyone in the country. It was a technological mission primarily, and we have achieved that. We give ourselves an 85 per cent mark for that achievement."
He mentioned several reasons for India's successful mix of engineering excellence and frugal spending behind the Mars mission.
Engineers recycled components and technologies used on other Indian satellites, and ISRO opted to launch the Mars mission on the proven Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), he said.
The PSLV placed the MOM spacecraft into orbit around Earth, then the craft used its own thrusters to escape Earth's gravity and fly to Mars.
"We replaced a very powerful launch vehicle system through this novelty. In that process, we also checked out all autonomy that we had to put on the satellite," he said.
Radhakrishnan ruled out sending man into space in immediate future and said India's future space science missions include the Chandrayaan 2 moon lander and rover, an X-ray astronomy satellite, and a solar research probe planned to operate at the L1 Lagrange point a million miles from Earth.

Maharashtra elections: No question of going along with BJP  says NCP chief Sharad Pawar17
0
Mumbai: In Maharashtra, where all parties are still coming to terms with broken alliances, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has dismissed any possibility to form an alliance with BJP.
"There is no question of going with BJP," Pawar clarified over reports that the NCP may tie up with the Bharatiya Janata Party, which also called off its alliance with the Shiv Sena, ahead of the Assembly polls in Maharashtra.
Pawar also maintained that the party wanted to keep the 15 year long alliance with Congress intact but the state leadership kept them waiting for too long. "The entire rank and file of the NCP wanted an alliance but a situation was created by the state leadership that the alliance had to be called off. In 2004, our numbers were more than the Congress but still accepted a Congress minister," he said.
#sharad pawar #ncp #congress #shiv sena
Blaming the Congress for the fillip apart of the alliance, the NCP chief said, "Congress said they will get back on the proposal. We told Praful Patel to coordinate with the CM. He was kept waiting. CM never met. Few days later, the Congress released the list of their own candidates. We were left with no choice," he said.
Pawar also said that they are not yet ready for the elections. "We were prepared to contest for 130 seats but the alliance was called off at the last moment and now we have to contest on 280 seats and we are not prepared. We do not have enough publicity materials," he said.
On a personal level, he maintained that his equation with Chavan is good. "But as an administrator, my NCP team was generally unhappy with Chavan. He did not take any decisions. Not to take decisions was his specialty. Under this leadership we have no future, is what the party workers felt," he said.
Pawar on Friday also said that he had no grouse against Congress President Sonia Gandhi as she was not responsible for breaking the alliance.
"When I called on Sonia Gandhi to discuss fighting Maharashtra jointly she was positive about the proposal. It was decided to hold talks at the state level to sort out seat sharing issues," he said.

Pune-educated Stanford professor Thomas Kailath, wins US National Medal of Science
IANS Oct 4, 2014, 09.14AM IST
(In this file photo, Prof…)
WASHINGTON: Thomas Kailath, a Pune educated Indian-American engineering professor at Stanford University, is one of the recipients of the US National Medal of Science announced by President Barack Obama.
Kailath is also a recipient of the Padma Bhushan, one of India's high civilian awards and is a member of major science and engineering academies in India.
He received his BE (telecom) degree from the College of Engineering, Pune before getting his SM and ScD degrees in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He then worked at the Jet Propulsion Labs in Pasadena, California, before joining Stanford University as associate professor of Electrical Engineering in 1963.
Kailath's research and teaching at Stanford have ranged over several fields of engineering and mathematics, with a different focus roughly every decade, according to his profile on the university website.
These included information theory, communications, linear systems, estimation and control, signal processing, semiconductor manufacturing, probability and statistics, and matrix and operator theory.
Kailath was promoted to professor in 1968, and was appointed the first holder of the Hitachi America Professorship in 1988. He assumed emeritus status in 2001, but remains active with his research and writing activities.
Kailath is a Fellow of the IEEE and has received the IEEE Medal of Honor in 2007 for contributions to the development of powerful algorithms for communications, control, computing and signal processing.
Among his other major honours are the Shannon Award of the IEEE Information Theory Society; the IEEE Education Medal and the IEEE Signal Processing Medal; Guggenheim, Churchill and Humboldt Fellowships.
He is also a member of the US National Academy of Engineering, the US National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and foreign member of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Spanish Academy of Engineering.
Obama also announced recipients of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. The new awardees will receive their medals at a White House ceremony later this year.
"These scholars and innovators have expanded our understanding of the world, made invaluable contributions to their fields, and helped improve countless lives," Obama said, according to a White House announcement.

Live telecast of RSS chief's speech irks Opposition
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat’s annual speech on Dussehra — and its unprecedented live telecast by public broadcaster Doordarshan — demonstrated the bonding and synergy between the Sangh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but drew sharp criticism from the Opposition and the social media.
On Thursday, Mr. Bhagwat’s speech lauded the Central government for “its initiatives on the front of economy, border security, international relations and many other areas.” The RSS chief, who underlined Hindutva as the core of Indian nationalism, added: “But we need to wait for some more time with a sense of hope and faith. The government should now ensure that these policies maintain their momentum in a determined and well-organised manner.”
Mr. Modi, a former full-time activist of the Sangh, tweeted in response: “Mohan Bhagwatji talked about important national issues in his speech. The issues of social reform that he raised are very relevant today.”
Opposition uproar
Doordarshan’s decision to telecast the RSS chief’s speech live did not go down well with the Opposition that severely criticised the broadcaster and the government. Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi said: “This is absolutely shockin
The Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) condemned the live telecast. “The RSS used the occasion to propagate its Hindutva ideology,” it said.
Doordarshan’s Director General (News) Archna Datta however, told The Hindu that each event is judged by its news worthiness. “We found it news worthy.”

Save precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI: Tucked away inside a suburban shopping complex, at the end of a long, dingy corridor, Secret Eye detective agency seems to be doing its best to keep a low profile. But on the other side of the door, you'd find it hard to miss a single detail.
Wallpaper bearing bright, pink roses covers one side of the room, deities crowd every available surface, and a giant aquarium sits next to the visitors' chairs. Every few seconds, its residents swim up and fix you with a beady-eyed stare. Their owner, peering intently across the table, has taught them well. He is narrating one of his favourite stories: shadowing the director of a reputed FMCG company, who had sent feelers out to a rival firm. Kumar D, the head of Secret Eye, had tracked him across flights and airports.
"He would meet the competitor's guy on the flight, while on business trips to Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai," Kumar recalls. "The bugger would go sit next to that person and hand over important documents. I followed him myself." Over ten days of smart snooping in air and on ground, Secret Eye cracked the case.
It was a close call though. "Once he walked up and said, 'I have seen you before. Are you following me?' I pointed to my 'wife' and replied, 'I'm travelling with family. Why are you keeping an eye on me?'" Kumar says, chuckling. "The idiot believed it and merrily continued."
While he'd rather spend time tracking the "more personal" cases like matrimonial investigation, the garrulous detective admits that, of late, his attention has been focused elsewhere. Over the past year, detective agencies in Mumbai have reported a sharp rise in a specific kind of corporate assignation. Companies are hiring detectives to investigate employees suspected to be moving to a competitor firm. At Secret Eye, among the city's most popular sleuth outfits, the number of such cases has doubled. From four or five odd assignments cases, the agency now gets close to a dozen each month.
With the competition in the IT and FMCG sector rocketing, the pastures have never been as green, says Kumar. Companies are paranoid about losing trade secrets along with the talent. "A number of corporate houses are merging or expanding their business," adds Naman Jain, managing director of Sleuths India, a leading agency that specializes in corporate investigation. "They try to poach their rivals' staff by offering lucrative salaries or better positions. After a person moves to a different firm, their loyalties shift too." With offices in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad, Sleuths India's clientele includes industry giants like Hindustan Unilever , Reckitt Benckiser , Yamaha and Acme Infosoft . Depending on how high-profile a detective agency is and the complexity of the assignment, fees can range from 10,000 for a day to tens of lakhs.
"In certain cases the employee has diverted intellectual drawings, R&D research, registered trademarked data, etc, to competitors," says Gautam Giri from Bandra's Sharp Detective agency, which too has seen its assignments double. "Billions of rupees and thousands of jobs are lost due to theft of trade secrets," he points out.
The monies and reputation involved see companies signing up for sleuths despite having watertight non-disclosure agreements in most offices.
Suspects are usually those who have spent decades in an organization and are familiar with its inner workings, says Jain, whose agency specializes in corporate investigation. "It could be anyone from the CEO to a member of the IT help staff," he explains. "The position doesn't matter. It's about the kind of information that they have had access to."
Assignments pan out over months or wrap up in days, depending on their complexity. Suspects are followed to faraway restaurants, tracked on trains and airplanes, and observed by undercover detectives at their workplace. As more and more evidence is collected, sensitive information previously entrusted to the suspect is gradually taken away, says Kumar. Responsibilities are shifted and before the employee moves out, he or she might be asked to sign a more stringent non-disclosure contract. Seldom is it revealed that they have been spied on. "The guy in question often doesn't have a clue what has been going on," Kumar adds, chuckling. "It is all very discreet."
Watch on private eyes
The detective sector in the country is technically an unlicenced one, with a 2007 bill pending in the Parliament, says Gautam Giri from Sharp Detective Agency.
There are, however, regulatory associations like the Association of Private Detectives and Investigators-India (APDI) based in Delhi, and the World Association of Detectives (WAD). Those setting up their own agency need to be members of one or both, depending on the area of operation.
Work experience, referrals from other agencies, trained staff and office premises are necessary.
Some also apply to the police for the Private Security Agencies Regulation Act (PSARA) licence. "It is an added regulatory measure that the reputed agencies take," Giri says. The fees for PSARA are Rs 10,000 for five years in Mumbai, 25,000 for Maharashtra and one lakh for operation across the country.

By Steve Kovach
I visited Samsung's headquarters in South Korea earlier this year. I saw a lot of cool stuff, including one of the labs where the company performs rigourous testing on its smartphones.
One of the craziest things I saw in that facility was a robot shaped like a butt that was designed to "sit" on Samsung phones over and over again to test durability and bending. It's supposed to simulate someone sitting on his phone.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a photo or video of the butt robot.
But Samsung has delivered. In what can only be a response to the iPhone 6 Plus " bendgate " hooplah, Samsung posted a video to its corporate blog showing how its 'butt robots' test the durability of the company's upcoming Galaxy Note 4 smartphone.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday gave a thumbs up to the Narendra Modi government in his annual Vijaya Dashami address controversially telecast live on Doordarshan.

DD telecast abuse of state power: Cong, Left
For the first time ever, the RSS chief's speech was telecast live on Doordarshan prompting the Congress and Left parties to accuse the Modi government of misusing the state broadcaster.
Terming the live telecast a "dangerous tradition" Congress spokesman Sandeep Dikshit said, "This is not an organisation which is completely neutral. It is a controversial organisation."
The CPI(M) condemned the telecast saying, "The national public broadcaster has no business to telecast live the speech of the chief of an organisation like the RSS."
Doordarshan officials defended the live coverage saying it was a newsworthy event.

Watch: Modi's US visit gives us renewed hope, says RSS chief Bhagwat
In his hour-long speech, Bhagwat, who had once pulled up the rank and file of the Sangh Parivar for shouting "Namo, Namo" and contested Narendra Modi giving credit to BJP chief Amit Shah for the election victory, showered praises on the government.
He said positive signs are emanating that give people the hope that India is emerging stronger on the international stage.
"There is no magic wand to change to change things, but the government seems committed," said the RSS chief who normally criticises the central government every year.
Bhagwat said Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to the US has sent positive signals and ushered in a new enthusiasm among people of the country.
"A new ray of hope has entered the hearts of the people. The entire country was feeling proud of the visit and the subsequent talks with the US government," he said, adding, the world needs India.
Voicing concern over 'upsurge in jihadi activities' in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the RSS chief said the state governments there were doing nothing to tackle the threat this posed to citizens.
He also criticised the governments in West Bengal and Assam saying, "The population imbalance in West Bengal and Assam has been caused by illegal migration of a particular community from across the national border. The ruling parties in those states have adopted a 'near surrender policy." 
The RSS chief also called for a ban on beef exports, and for an end to widespread purchases of Chinese products.
Speaking on global terrorism, he blamed western countries for the rise of Islamic State. "The selfish interest by the western countries is fully responsible for a new incarnation of terror and fundamentalism that emerged in West Asia in the name of ISIS," Bhagwat said.
RSS chief raised relevant issues: Modi
Meanwhile, PM Modi hailed Bhagwat's speech and said the issues of social reform he raised "are very relevant."
 
"Mohan Bhagwat ji talked about important national issues in his speech. The issues of social reform that he raised are very relevant today," Modi tweeted.

He then worked at the Jet Propulsion Labs in Pasadena, California, before joining Stanford University as associate professor of Electrical Engineering in 1963.
Kailath's research and teaching at Stanford have ranged over several fields of engineering and mathematics, with a different focus roughly every decade, according to his profile on the university website.
These included information theory, communications, linear systems, estimation and control, signal processing, semiconductor manufacturing, probability and statistics, and matrix and operator theory.
Kailath was promoted to professor in 1968, and was appointed the first holder of the Hitachi America Professorship in 1988. He assumed emeritus status in 2001, but remains active with his research and writing activities.
Kailath is a Fellow of the IEEE and has received the IEEE Medal of Honor in 2007 for contributions to the development of powerful algorithms for communications, control, computing and signal processing.

Grenade found on Modis standby aircraft was left over from anti-terror drill  says AirIndiaA defused grenade was found on a plane that kept as a standby for PM Narendra Modi. (Source: PTI)
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 10:53 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 11:48 am
A defused grenade found on Friday night in the business class of an Air India jumbo aircraft kept as standby for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent US visit, could have been the remanant of an anti-terror drill.
The grenade was found by the Air India crew on board the Boeing 747-400 which was operating the Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah flight, airline sources said. On landing at Jeddah, the incident was reported to the local security agencies who took over the aircraft, sources said.
An AI executive said that it was the “plastic casing” of a shell of a stun grenade used by security during the anti terror drills carried out in the plane and that it was “completely harmless”. The airline is carrying out its investigations and the aircraft has been held back at Jeddah despite being cleared by airport security.
The plane is likely to return to Calicut soon.
The aircraft had been kept as a standby for the recent US visit of Modi. The Prime Minister had undertaken a five-day visit to the US from September 25.

'Clean India Mission beyond politics'
New Delhi, Oct 2:  
Wielding the broom, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched the country’s biggest-ever cleanliness drive that is expected to cost over Rs 62,000 crore, asserting that the “Swachh Bharat” mission is “beyond politics” and inspired by patriotism.
Debunking criticism that his Government has been taking credit for every achievement, the Prime Minister acknolwedged the efforts of all previous governments to make India clean.
“I am not talking politics...this is beyond politics.
"This is inspired by patriotism not politcs. We do not have to do with an eye on politics...I say that with a clean heart...
"If we paint this again with a brush of politics, we will again do a disservice to mother India.
“All the governments in this country have made one or the other effort to do this work. Several political, social and cultural organizations have made efforts in this direction. I greet all those, who have worked,” Modi said in his 25-minute address at Rajpath, where he formally kicked off the five-year-long campaign that will cover 4,041 statutory towns.
Administering a pledge to people to make India clean, he said that this task is not the responsibility only of safai karamcharis or the government but of all the 125 crore Indians.
He said that today’s campaign should not be seen as a mere photo opportunity.
In an event marked by fervour and symbolism, the Prime Minister earlier wielded a broom and swept pavement in Valmiki Basti, a colony of sanitation workers here.
The Prime Minister said that he is aware that the criticism of this programme will begin in just a few days but said he is prepared for this exuding confidence that the countrymen will not let him down.
The urban component of the Mission is proposed to be implemented over 5 years starting from October 2, 2014 in all 4,041 statutory towns. The total expected cost of the programme is Rs 62,009 crore, out of which the proposed central assistance will be of Rs 14,623 crore.
The Cabinet had last month decided to merge the ‘Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan’, a campaign for rural sanitation with Swachh Bharat Mission.
The Prime Minister countered Congress criticism that his government behaves as if everything happened only after he came to power. “I do not make any claim that the government, which has been elected to power just now, has done everything.”
Congress has been attacking Modi accusing him of taking credit of initiatives undertaken by the UPA regimes and trying to give an impression that every good work was done only by him.
Recalling that he had congratulated all governments even from the ramparts of Red Fort, Modi said,”even today from this stage, I greet and salute all the governments—central, state and municipal, social organizations which have worked in this direction, whether they are leaders from Sarvodaya or workers of Seva Dal. I launch this programme with their blessings.”
Maintaining that everybody deserves kudos, the Prime Minister asked not to get into making political barbs on the issue.
“Everybody before us has worked for it. Under Mahatma Gandhi’s leadership, the Congress had led it...Who was successful, who was not. Let us not get into it who has done it, who has not. We should work responsibly,” he said.

The 8 best questions to ask a job interviewerThe 8 Best Questions to Ask a Job Interviewer
By Aaron Guerrero | U.S.News & World Report LP –  Thu 11 Sep, 2014 2:01 AM IST
Print
Employers aren't the only ones who get to poke and pry during an interview.
At some point, job candidates can make inquiries that flesh out everything from expectations to why their prospective boss enjoys working for the company. By asking thought-provoking questions, you can not only collect valuable information but also distinguish yourself from the pack. Here are some questions you can ask and tips for interpreting the responses from your interviewer.
1. How has this position evolved since it was created?
Cheryl Palmer, career coach and founder of the career coaching firm Call to Career, says getting a brief history on the role should clear up whether the position has expanded over the years or has been a dead end for employees.
Interpreting the response
If the interviewer says the position has expanded beyond its original scope (and is continuing to do so), that signifies an opportunity for growth within the company. If the position has stayed static for years, don't expect to blossom there. Depending on your career ambitions, the latter response isn't necessarily bad, Palmer says.
2. What have past employees done to succeed in this position?
Knowing how the organization measures achievements will help you understand what the expectations will be and whether you have the skill set to meet them, Palmer says. But don't undermine your past accomplishments just because your route to success doesn't match up with the one embraced by the company. "You also don't want to be too narrowly defined by what other people have done. Because you're a different person, you may approach things a little differently," she says.
Interpreting the response
You may hear a description that highlights the positive and negative attributes of your predecessor. That could be a good indicator of the company's culture . "Typically, what one person has done to be successful is what the organization tends to do to be successful," Palmer says.
3. What have you enjoyed most about working here?
Your prospective boss can relay what he or she values most and what led to his or her personal success with the organization . Then, Palmer says, you can internally ruminate about whether you share the same values and can envision yourself working there.
Interpreting the response
Your interviewer may commend the company for everything from benefits to year-end bonuses. On the other hand, "if they're struggling to come up with something positive about why they like working there, chances are good that you're not going to be able to come up with anything positive after having worked there either," Palmer says.
4. What is the top priority for the person in this position over the next three months?
This question is helpful so you know what to focus on if you do get the position, Palmer says. Without a clear expectation, she adds, you won't know what to accomplish or how to make the right impression during your first days on the job .
Interpreting the response
You may be told that you need to complete 15 tasks rather than two or three. "If these are all big initiatives that they want you to handle, [they're] probably not that doable," Palmer says.
5. What are the qualities of successful managers in this company?
If you're interviewing for a managerial position, you'll want knowledge of the skills and core competencies the company treasures in a leader, says David Lewis, founder and president of OperationsInc, a Connecticut-based human resources outsourcing and consulting firm. If excellent people skills and multitasking top the list, emphasize how you've demonstrated those traits throughout your career.
Interpreting the response
According to Lewis, you may get a response along these lines: "The best managers in our organization are independent thinkers, are good teachers and completely aligned with the direction the company is going in." If he or she can't name a single star in the managerial stable, that's problematic and may indicate the organization is short on progress and promotions, Lewis notes.
6. If offered the position, can you give me examples of ways I would collaborate with my manager?
As an entry-level staffer , you may want to work with management as a means to showcase your skills and move up. But there's a distinction between simply taking orders and actively working with a superior who is grooming you for something better. "[Finding] out how an organization utilizes people at the staff level is key," Lewis says. "Is it a dictatorial environment or a collaborative one?"
Interpreting the response
The employer may be short on examples or dismiss the notion of working with management altogether. Prod further, Lewis says, and find out why that it is. There may be a legitimate reason why the company doesn't promote collaboration.
7. What are some challenges that will face the person filling this position?
You owe it to yourself to know what you're up against. "It just gives you a reality check," Palmer says. The drawbacks may differ depending on whether the position is managerial or entry-level. As a manager, you may oversee a department that runs on a shoestring budget. As a lower-level staffer, you may work odd hours or get stuck with assignments that lack substance.
Interpreting the response
The interviewer may point out the least offensive parts of the job. But if he or she denies any downside whatsoever, that should raise doubts about his or her credibility. "Any boss that tells you there are not challenges, they're lying. It's just that simple," Palmer says.
8. Do you have any hesitations about my qualifications?
Asking a question like this lets the interviewer know you're secure enough to openly discuss your vulnerabilities. It also signals confidence and the ability to be coached, says John Kador, author of "301 Best Questions to Ask on Your Interview." "Coachability is a hugely attractive attribute as far as interviewers are concerned," he explains.
Interpreting the response
At your urging, the interviewer may voice concerns about a lack of training in certain areas or gaps in employment . Rather than gloss over your shortcomings, address them and put up a respectful and reasonable defense. "You may be able to come up with a satisfactory response, you may not," Kador says. "But at least you have the chance."

Obama condemns beheading of British aid worker Alan HenningPress Trust of India | Washington | Posted: October 4, 2014 9:49 am
US President Barack Obama has strongly condemned the “brutal murder” of British national Alan Henning, and vowed to bring to justice those who were responsible for it.
“The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said on Friday.
Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family and the people of the UK, he said.
“Standing together with our UK friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan’s murder – as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines – to justice,” he added.
“Standing together with a broad coalition of allies and partners, we will continue taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL,” Obama said.
The 47-year-old from Manchester in northwest England had volunteered to help drive an aid convoy to Syria for a Muslim charity, and was kidnapped 10 months ago.
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group.

Head of Citigroups troubled Mexico unit resignsHead of Citigroup’s troubled Mexico unit resigns

Tweet
New York, Oct 3:  
Citigroup today said that the chief executive of its Mexican subsidiary Grupo Financiero Banamex had resigned, seven months after the U.S. bank revealed a costly fraud at the unit.
Citi said that Javier Arrigunaga was stepping down “in light of the difficult challenges our franchise in Mexico has faced over the past year.”
In February Citi took a charge of about U.S. $ 235 million from profits, saying it discovered “significant” fraud on the books of oil contractor Oceanografia after having lent it U.S. $ 585 million through a Banamex unit.
After that Citi fired a dozen employees involved with Banamex, including four managing directors.
Last year Banamex was criticised by the Federal Reserve for lax money-laundering controls, especially at a U.S. subsidiary.
Arrigunaga is being replaced by Ernesto Torres Cantu, currently CEO of Grupo Banamex unit Banco Nacional de Mexico.

Hong Kong police arrest 19 in protestclashLocal police take a man away from the confrontation of pro-democracy student protesters and angry local residents in Kowloon's crowded Mong Kok district (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Hong Kong | Posted: October 4, 2014 10:55 am | Updated: October 4, 2014 12:05 pm
Hong Kong arrested 19 people, some believed to have organized crime ties, during a night of running brawls stretching into Saturday as mobs tried to drive pro-democracy protesters from the streets where they’ve held a weeklong, largely peaceful demonstration.
At least 12 people and six officers were injured during the clashes, Senior Superintendent Patrick Kwok Pak-chung said. Protest leaders called off planned talks with the government on political reforms after the battles kicked off Friday afternoon in gritty, blue-collar Mong Kok, across Victoria Harbor from the activists’ main protest camp.
Police struggled for hours to control the battles as attackers pushed, shoved and jeered the protesters. Those arrested face charges of unlawful assembly, fighting in public and assault, Kwok said, adding that eight men are believed to have backgrounds involving triads, or organized crime gangs.
The protesters urged residents to join their cause and demanded that police protect their encampments. The Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the groups leading the demonstrations that drew tens of thousands of people earlier this week, said they saw no choice but to cancel the dialogue.
“The government is demanding the streets be cleared. We call upon all Hong Kong people to immediately come to protect our positions and fight to the end,” the group said in a statement.
They demanded the government hold someone responsible for the scuffles, the worst disturbances since police used tear gas and pepper spray on protesters last weekend to try to disperse them.
“Of course I’m scared, but we have to stay and support everyone,” said Michael Yipu, 28, who works in a bank.
The allegations that organized crime members were involved in the clashes fueled jitters Saturday at the movement’s main camp, on a highway outside government headquarters. There were frequent calls for supporters to rush to barricades after sporadic rumors that people were coming to attack them.
“Many people are gathering here and they are very determined to unite against the triad members,” said Amy Ho, 21, who was studying translation at university.
The standoff is the biggest challenge to Beijing’s authority since it took over the former British colony in 1997. Earlier Friday, the students had agreed to talks with the government proposed by Hong Kong’s leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. But his attempt to defuse tensions fell flat as many protesters were unhappy with his refusal to yield to their demands for his resignation.
The cancellation of the talks – prompted by clashes with men who tried to tear down the makeshift barricades and tents set up by the demonstrators – left the next steps in the crisis uncertain.
It was unclear if those scuffles were spontaneous or had been organized, although some of continued…

NEW DELHI: Reflecting "solid" growth over the past two months, India's domestic passenger traffic rose 7.4% in August, recording the second highest growth rate globally after Russia's 10%, latest IATA data shows.
"Indian domestic demand climbed 7.4%. Results for the last two months have been solid, perhaps an early sign of improvement as a result of the new business-supportive government regime," the analysis of the data by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said. India's domestic Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), which measures actual passenger traffic, grew 7.4% over August last year, almost matching the 7.6% rise in Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) that indicates available passenger capacity or the number of aircraft seats available.
The overall average domestic demand rose 4.5% in August compared to August 2013 with all markets reporting growth, led by Russia and India , the analysis said. Like India, Russia's high growth rate of 10.1% showed that the airlines there "have been able to stimulate domestic demand through significant fare reductions", it said. The international air traffic results showed a "slight pick-up in demand" in August over the previous month.

Used stun grenade found on PM Modi s standby aircraft  security forces in a tizzyComments
A dummy stun grenade was found on Saturday aboard an Air India Boeing 747 aircraft, one of two standby planes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent US visit.
As it turned out, the fake grenade had been used by the National Security Guard (NSG) for an ‘aircraft intervention drill’ a day after the PM’s departure, when the plane was released for commercial use and flown to Mumbai.
But given that such a lapse took place on an aircraft that was to serve as a replacement for Air India One if the need arose, the incident has exposed a gaping hole in the country’s aviation safety.
After its release to Air India on September 25, the double-decker plane flew on the Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah route on Friday and landed in the Saudi Arabian city early Saturday, when the discovery was made by cabin crew.
In response, Air India dismissed the “suspicious object” found on the upper deck of business class as a “plastic wrapper”, and also denied the plane was a stand by aircraft for the PM.
But late evening, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju confirmed the discovery of the empty stun grenade, calling the incident a “serious security failure”.
The government suspended four AI employees, including security managers at Mumbai and Hyderabad airports, and appointed a high-level inquiry committee chaired by AI’s joint managing director Nasir Ali. Ground-handling officers and security supervisors could also face strict action.
The NSG has said it will probe the matter. “We have ordered an inquiry to see how even an empty casing of a stun grenade, which was without any explosive material, was left behind,” said a senior NSG official. The Special Protection Group, responsible for the PM’s security, will also look into the incident.
No actual weapons or explosives are used in such drills, a senior security official said. In fact, the NSG — the country’s elite anti-hijacking and anti-terror commando force — gives a certificate to AI saying no live ammunition will be used.
The 747’s crew noticed the grenade as it rolled out from beneath one of the seats.
The pilots informed Jeddah air traffic control and the plane was moved to a remote bay for checks. “Had it come to light when the plane was airborne, it would have led to force-landing, resulting in a mid-air scare,” said a security source.
The grenade carried the marking ‘anti-riot stun grenade’ and was produced at the BSF’s Tekanpur-based Tear Smoke Unit.
In Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh, the civil aviation minister said, “Corrective measures must be taken. The incident must not be repeated.”

Toll in Patna stampede rises to 33  govt to beginprobeA policeman carries a boy injured in a stampede in Patna. (Source: AP)
Press Trust of India | Patna | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:09 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 12:45 pm
With one more person succumbing to injuries, the toll in the stampede outside the sprawling Gandhi Maidan here after Dussehra celebrations has climbed to 33.
Principal Secretary Home Amir Subhani said that one more person died on Saturday, taking the toll to 33. Twenty-nine others were injured of whom the condition of four patients was stated to be critical, Subhani said.
Of the 29 injured admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), 17 are women and 12 are men, he said. Subhani, who along with Additional Director General of Police (Headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey has been appointed to inquire into the stampede incident, said he would begin the probe with a visit to the spot at Gandhi Maidan at noon.

India Inc companies go all out to retain talentFirms like PepsiCo, Coca Cola ,others institute rewards and recognition programmes to retain talent

(Employers are realising that…)
NEW DELHI: Top performers at PepsiCo India can look forward to a cracker of a Diwali. Apart from the annual global rewards programme, vying for the chance to go to New York to meet PepsiCo's senior leadership team as well as colleagues from different regions for four-five days, top performers in the foods business could get free tickets for cricket World Cup 2015 in Australia this festive season.
In the war for talent in the resurgent job market, companies are thinking of big and frequent rewards for top talent. Employers are realising that compensation, company merchandise and annual bonuses may not be enough to retain key talent. Benefits now include perks such as those at PepsiCo, exotic vacations to locations like Greece and Monaco, and mid-year bonuses.
Since companies want to retain volumes, a large number of performers, especially millennials, are also being lured through rewards such as shopping vouchers for Flipkart and Snapdeal besides iPhones and tablets. Hemant Upadhyay, managing consultant and leader of executive rewards practice at Hay Group in India, has seen a sea change in rewards and benefits strategies of companies in the current job market.
"Employees, especially the millennials, at the junior to mid levels need much more than compensation to stay on, as they have lesser liabilities and immense opportunities. Technology is a hit with this pool of talent, so companies are doling out benefits like iPhones and the latest gadgets or online vouchers, and are making specific tailormade plans for senior employees to suit their individual needs. Rewards can't be taken for granted anymore," he said.
Upadhyay recalls one of the more special rewards this year — a client transferring the title of a company owned house to a senior executive. "It worked as a great retention tool, as the company thought that instead of stocks and compensation, the house which was provided by the company to the employee could be given to him provided he retires with them, as it would have tremendous emotional value for him. The location and architecture was such that he wouldn't have been able to buy it on his own," he said.
Given the optimism in the job market, stocks may come back into vogue and may be given to those just below the senior level who otherwise may not be entitled to them, said Shiv Agrawal, managing director of ABC Consultants.
"One clear trend is companies increasingly looking at providing benefits which give a sense of investing in self to employees. Executive education programmes are becoming increasingly popular too," he said. At Coca Cola India, a cross-functional team that conceptualized its Support My School programme, was sent to Russia and Turkey this year to learn of similar community development and sustainability projects there.
Over at Vodafone, Strike Force is the telecom company's premier programme for recognition of best performers across all circles. Top management executives accompany this select group on trips to locations such as Greece and Turkey and felicitate them at an awards ceremony. Platinum Club, the premier awards programme under Microsoft's Circle of Excellence platform, recognises top performers at a global level.
The grand prize is a stay of four nights at the Monte Carlo Bay Hotel in Monaco. "We have instituted such rewards and recognition programmes to thank employees for giving Microsoft their best every day, for believing in our brand, our culture and values, our passion for technology and innovation, our career development programmes and our social impact," said Rohit Thakur, head of HR for Microsoft in India.
PepsiCo even has a deferred bonus payout scheme to pep up employees. "This has been developed with an aim to motivate employees in the middle of the year and to increase the overall quantum of bonus payouts," said a spokesperson. Indian employers are moving away from kitchen appliances, dinner sets and dry fruits to fashion apparel and accessories besides gadgets such as iPhones, said Sagar Chaudhuri, CEO and co-founder of Bangalore-based HighFives.
 
Having worked in companies such as JP Morgan, Infosys, ICICI and Genpact, Chaudhuri and his cofounders felt there was a paucity of innovative rewards and recognition practices in companies. HighFives helps them manage reward processes with minimum administrative overheads. Chaudhuri said its reward programmes work on a point-based system. Employees can redeem points awarded for various assignments on HighFives.
Electronic gadgets such as microwaves and washing machines aside, iPhones, tablets and shopping vouchers from Jabong, Flipkart and Myntra are a hit with employees. At HCL Technologies, the share of incremental earnings to top-performing employees has increased, which means top performers are likely to get a higher proportion of rewards.

Never blamed Sonia for Congress-NCP split: P...Never blamed Sonia Gandhi for split, clarifies Sharad Pawar

(Pawar also said that though…)
MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said on Friday said he did not blame Congress President Sonia Gandhi for the split between Congress and NCP. "I have no issues with Sonia. She was very positive about continuing the alliance (when I met her). The seat sharing issues were to be discussed at the state level," said Pawar, adding that he didn't blame Rahul Gandhi either. "I have not even uttered the name of Rahul in this connection.
While Pawar didn't blame Sonia, his remarks clearly show that he holds former Maharashtra CMPrithviraj Chavan responsible for the break-up of the alliance.
Pawar also said that though he personally wasn't in favour of fielding a candidate against Chavan in his constituency Karad, the party took a decision to field a candidate against him, reflecting the anger against the former CM.
The NCP chief said that the party was now facing a 'challenging' task after the split with the Congress as they hadn't planned to contest more than 200 seats initially. "When we were in talks with the Congress, we were only planning to contest 130 to 135 seats, but now we have to contest 275 to 280, which is a challenge. We are obviously facing certain difficulties as our manpower and publicity material that we had accounted for was only for 130 to 135 seats," Pawar explained.
The veteran politician also had a piece of advice for both his nephew Ajit Pawar and Chavan. "I can't tell the CM, but I will ask my associates to avoid making any personal comments," Pawar said, without naming his nephew.

JPMorgan Says Breach Affected 76 Million Householdsjpmorgan says breach affected 76 million households
Over 80 per cent abandon flood-hit UttarakhandPrint
DEHRADUN: Non-Government organisations seemed to be omnipresent after Rudraprayag was hit by flash floods last year.
They all expressed their desire to be part of the reconstruction initiatives, and signed hundreds of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the district administration.
But now, most of them have vanished. Over 80 per cent of these NGOs have left the district without doing anything.
Besides the NGOs, several corporate groups and government agencies visited Rudraprayag, aiming to provide help to the affected families.
They had their tasks cut out: construction of houses for villagers and new school buildings; ensuring supply of potable water; and chalking out livelihood programmes. But these tasks remained only on paper; the reality has been quite bleak.
The only silver lining, as always, remained the impressive reconstruction operations of the Army and the paramilitary forces.
The district administration keeps track of the work done by the NGOs, and updates relevant information on the official website http://rudraprayag.nic.in
However, it is clear from the website that many of the NGOs have left.
In case of such NGOs, the district authority has clearly mentioned - “Backed out and the MoU they signed with the state remains cancelled.”
Rudraprayag district magistrate Raghav Langer said: “After last year’s flash floods, about 200 to 300 NGOs approached us. Many signed MoUs for various reconstruction works. But now only 35 voluntary organisations are active and continue to work.”
The number of organisations that are actually working in the Mandakini Valley, which was affected by the floods, is also small.
Over a hundred government schools were damaged in last year’s disaster. The list includes 23 high schools/intermediate schools, and 84 primary/upper primary schools. But it seems the NGOs took little interest in reconstruction of the schools.
Barring reconstruction of 19 schools, for which a few selected voluntary organisations or corporates have been involved, the rest of the damaged schools were to be reconstructed with the aid from Central government’s Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.
While several NGOs were initially active in distributing relief materials, they gradually disappeared.
Observers say that several NGOs were less keen on distributing relief materials in the far-flung areas. And the affected families in those areas are still waiting for help.
In sharp contrast to the NGOs, the Army and paramilitary forces impressed one and all with their reconstruction work.
The Border Security Force adopted 12 villages in the Kalimath Valley. They constructed a school, five community halls, built an embankment to protect the ancient Kalimath temple, set up four trolleys and constructed three temporary helipads.
The force also distributed tents, solar lights, food, books, computers and television sets, besides providing medical aid to the affected people.
And all of it was done smoothly in a span of less than six months.
Laxman Satkari, a resident of Kotma village, said: “The state government should have used the Army on a larger scale for the reconstruction.”

Modi govt slammed for telecasting RSS speech on DoordarshanEYE BROWSE
Modi government flayed for broadcasting RSS speech on Doordarshan
The Communist Party of India-Marxist said RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat used "the occasion to propagate its Hindutva ideology".
Yahoo India –  Fri 3 Oct, 2014

NEW DELHI: The opposition has strongly criticised the government for telecasting live the Vijaya Dashmi speech of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on state broadcaster, Doordarshan, saying this shows "how the public broadcaster is being misused".
The Communist Party of India-Marxist said RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat used "the occasion to propagate its Hindutva ideology".
"The national public broadcaster has no business to telecast live the speech of the chief of an organisation like the RSS," a CPI-M statement said.
"Such an action shows how the public broadcaster is being misused by the Modi government."
Condemning the telecast, Communist Party of India (CPI) leader D Raja said that the telecast is a clear departure from the stated position of the government and from the practice so far public sector telecasting and broadcasting followed.
Raja said, "It is a clear departure from the stated position of the government and from the practice so far public sector telecasting and broadcasting followed. Now, the Doordarshan has become a mouthpiece of RSS which is not in the interest of the secular democracy which we all climb in our country."
"Not only a speech has been telecast live, there is a whole lot of debate over it. The ministry owns an explanation to the nation on how this happened and who has taken such a decision to allow RSS to use Doordarshan as their instrument," he added.
Amid all the criticism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat for raising "very relevant" issues of social reform.
"Mohan Bhagwatji talked about important national issues in his speech. The issues of social reform he raised are very relevant today," Modi said in a tweet.
The prime minister added: "On the Sthapana Divas (founding day) of RSS, I extend my good wishes to all Swayamsevaks."
In his customary Dussehra rally at the RSS headquarters here, Bhagwat said: "It is only six months but positive signs are already emanating."
Continuing the tradition of the annual Vijaya Dashmi celebrations since 1925, which has entered the 90th year, Bhagwat said: "It (the central government) is moving in the right direction, but we will have to give them time... with a sense of hope and faith. Nobody has a magic wand by which all problems of many years will disappear."
He said a few months ago, the people brought about a drastic change in the government.
"It appears that the peoples' desire of a life, security and to progress will soon start reflecting in the governance. Fortunately, we can see today a set of leadership which appears keen to give practical shape to the values... for the welfare of the nation.
"Some policy initiatives by the centre on the fronts of economy, national security, international relations and other areas have raised good hopes... They should now ensure these maintain momentum in a determined and systematic manner," Bhagwat said.
Top RSS functioneries like Manmohan Vaidya, Jagadish Prasad, Rashtra Sevika Samiti (women's wing) chief V. Shanta Kumari, Pramila Tai attended the victory rally preceded by a demonstration at the Reshimbagh Maidan here.
Bhagwat took the occasion to congratulate Indian scientists for the successful Mars Orbiter Mission and the athletes who brought pride by winning medals in the ongoing Asian Games in South Korea.
A top official of Doordarshan defending the decision to telecast Bhagwat's speech, was quoted by NDTV saying: 'It is a news event for us and that is why we covered it like any other newsworthy event.'
Public broadcaster Doordarshan today telecasted the annual Vijaya Dashmi speech of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat from Nagpur.
The Vijaya Dashmi event has been the time of an annual event in which the RSS leader lays down the Sangh's vision, analyses the situation in the country and mentions its expectations from the government, since the founding of the organisation in 1925.

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
PUNE: With the monsoon having withdrawn from most parts of India and on the way out from some, the Met office has said that rainfall this season has been 88% of the long period average (LPA) or 50-year average.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in its final weekly report, the country's LPA was expected to be 87% (+ or - 4%) for 2014. India's rainfall for July and August was 90% and 91% of the LPA as against the predicted 93% and 96% (+ or - 9%).
Meanwhile, central India, which includes Maharashtra, and south peninsula are the two regions with least rainfall deficit in the country. Central India has ended up with a 10% deficit, while south peninsula has 7% rainfall deficiency as compared to normal. Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab and West Uttar Pradesh received deficient rainfall by more the 50% of the LPA, the report said.
For the entire country, cumulative rainfall this monsoon has been 12% below the LPA. Of the 36 meteorological subdivisions, rainfall has been surplus over one, which is south interior Karnataka, normal over 23 subdivisions and deficient over 12 subdivisions. The report said that 3% area of the country received excess rainfall, 67% normal and 30 % deficient rainfall during the monsoon.
Maharashtra as a whole has ended up with a rain deficit of 14%, while central Maharashtra shows a 7% deficit, while Marathwada reels under 42% deficit this monsoon, the IMD said.
As per the Met office's analysis, rainfall for the country during July and August was 90% and 91% of the LPA. As for the four regions of the country, in northwest India, rainfall this year was 79% of the LPA, while the met office had in its long range forecast predicted 85% (+ or - 8%) for this region. Similarly, as against the met office's forecast of rainfall in central India being 94% (+ or - 8%) of the LPA this year, it was actually 90% of the average.
In south peninsula, rainfall has been 93% of the LPA, in agreement with met department's long range forecast. East and northeast India received rainfall which was 88% of the average as against met officials' prediction of 99% (+ or - 8%), the IMD said.
The southwest monsoon, meanwhile, has withdrawn from Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan, most parts of West Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and some parts of Jammu, Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh , East Uttar Pradesh, West Madhya Pradesh and north Arabian Sea. The withdrawal line of southwest monsoon continues to pass through Jammu, Una, Bareilly, Kanpur, Nowgong, Ujjain, Vadodara, Porbandar, among others.
The Met office has forecast that conditions are favourable for further withdrawal of southwest monsoon from the remaining parts of northwest India and some more parts of central India during the next two to three days.
Southwest monsoon may start withdrawing from parts of Maharashtra during the second week of October, said a senior IMD official. However, the monsoon normally withdraws from the state in the first week of October.

The Karnataka high court has agreed to hear former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa's appeal against her conviction on a priority basis. The matter will be heard on Wednesday by a specially constituted vacation bench.
The significant turn of events came hours after a vacation bench on Tueaday morning adjourned the matter to October 6. The adjournment order was issued after the Karnataka government failed to appoint a public prosecutor to contest the challenge mounted by Jayalalithaa's legal team.
Her lawyers immediately approached the high court registrar and the chief justice seeking urgent hearing of the matter.
They submitted that the matter should be treated as an exception as the continued incarceration of Jayalalithaa was causing law and order problems in Tamil Nadu.
 
They also argued that the AIADMK leader's health was unstable. Contesting the need for a public prosecutor to file objections, her lawyers cited sections of the CrPC and said that when the sentence is less than 10 years the judge of a higher court can adjudicate the appeal on merits without seeking the view of the prosecutor.
Jaya refuses to meet Panneerselvam
Former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa on Wednesday refused to meet O Panneerselvam, the man she has entrusted with the job of holding the CM's chair until she gets the relief she's hoping for from the court.
Panneerselvam was camping in the city since Monday evening for a chance to meet his jailed leader and seek her blessings. He landed in the city shortly after he was administered the oath of office by the Tamil Nadu governor.
He returned disappointed after jail authorities told him that Jayalalithaa had refused to meet him. Jail sources told HT that her cell is far from the visitor's area and she was not in a physical state to walk the distance.

Modi premium over  market s focus back on quality stocks: Ridham Desai08:00 am
Indian equities are done away with the Modi premium over the past three months and are back to focusing on high quality stocks with high earnings visibility, says Ridham Desai, Managing Director, Morgan Stanley. However, this skepticism is good for the bulls, he tells CNBC-TV18 in an interview.
Second quarter earnings season, which kicks off from October 10, will be watched out and sectors like healthcare, technology and consumer staples are likely to post strong growth, he adds.
Once earnings are out of the way, the state elections will be market's focus in the start of Q3. “The BJP is taking risks by going alone in Maharashtra state elections and the market is trying to price in this event. But any adverse election result for BJP in Maharashtra could be a negative cue for the market,” cautions Desai.
On the macro front, Inflation remains a major concern for India at this point of time, but Desai expects the inflation situation to improve in the next six-eight months.
Globally, markets are likely to remain liquid as recovery will take time and among EMs China is looking vulnerable negative for the market in the short-term, he says. “ We are seeing FII selling in anticipation of a difficult October month . Going ahead, global factors and government  action at home, will play key role in market movement.”
On sectors, Desai prefers betting on discretionary consumption stocks over industrials in the cyclicals space. From the defensive pack, he finds IT as a good bet consumer staples purely based on valuations. He also sees potential in the energy sector given the government’s focus on this space.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Ridham Desai's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: After a lot of optimism from the markets and from India Inc and the lay public -- after six months, people have started questioning the Modi premium, what is the near-term sense? I know you are a marathon runner as far as markets are concerned, but for just one thing like a sprinter, a thing like a 400 meter guy, tell us for the near-term do you think the market has something to worry in terms of having run too hard and because policy decisions are not quite coming fast?
A: The point you are making is a very good valid point. Market has given up on the Modi premium not today, it has been giving up for the past three months. In fact, if I am not wrong, since the election day, beta has underperformed, cyclicals have underperformed, the market is back to quality like it was before September 30 or October 30 when the market started building in favourable election result. So it is back to the anchoring that it has had for five years, go and buy technology, buy consumer staples, buy healthcare, buy whatever has visible earnings growth. Let us not bet on the turn in the cycle, let us not bet that companies will turn in terms of the earnings. Leverage was in play for a while in the first half of the year. That has gone away, capex was in play, that has gone away, beta has gone away, yield has gone away.
In fact, if you look at the last three months, high price to book, high price to earnings, high RoE, high free cash flow, these are the factors that have worked. So the market is already very sceptical. To me this is great news for bulls because you want a sceptical market, you don’t want a run away, irrational bull market that ends very quickly. Market is very rational in the way it is behaving. It is not applying indiscrete multiples to stocks who are going to show better performances in next five years rather than it is playing for current earnings.
Anuj: You believe the IT, pharmaceutical outperformance that we have seen over the last 15 days or 20 days or even one month that is something that can be sustained over the next few months or something?
A: That is a separate question. So what has happened is that these stocks have done very well not only 15-20 days but over the past three-four months now in various bouts and various cycles. What happens in the next year or two depends on how the world pans out -- I think we should not underestimate what is happening globally whether it is geopolitics, whether it is China, whether it is the Fed cycle, these are very big events they will impact growth in stocks in India along the way and of course what the government does in order to turn the cycle.
I think so far the news has been good. I can see that people are getting a bit impatient in their conversations at least but the government has done a fairly decent job in his four-five months in power because as PM Modi mentioned at Madison Square Garden, India has a three Ds, demographics, demand and democracy. So we know that. What needs to change because we had this even five years ago and ten years ago. Nothing has inherited because of the election result but the thing that has to change is productivity.
If you look at what the government is doing over the past three-four months is intense focus on productivity. Even this cleanliness drive that comes tomorrow is all about productivity. So if you get productivity going then growth will come back and if you look at all the indicators and this is little to do with what the government has done in the last four-five months but the accumulated benefit of what we have done as a country over the past two years is that growth is slowly taking up.
So there is initial scepticism, it will be there when a growth cycle turns. There was a bit of euphoria in terms of the election, I think that has gone away. I measure it from the performance of cyclicals, from the performance of beta not from the performance of the Nifty. So I think that has probably gone away and now the market will sit back, wait for these growth indicators to continue to register upward momentum and then those stocks will come back. So I hope that answers your question. In the meanwhile, if you look at this quarter for example, healthcare will do well, technology will do well, in large parts staples will be okay so those are the stocks that may continue to deliver near-term performance because the market wants earnings eventually.
Latha: Would you not worry about this implementation slowness from the government. One worry is also that the PM seems to be working alone. We don’t see leaders around him like you saw in previous governments, not that they delivered but would implementation be a worry for you at all?
A: We get this question time and again from a lot of people inside India as well as outside India. So we set about listing out the things that have happened since May and that list of thing runs into six pages.
There are so many things that have happened. From the end of boiler inspection raj to the change of labour laws in Rajasthan to the alteration of the land acquisition bill at the state level to the various things that have happened at the centre with respect to decisions taken in the finance ministry or in the road ministry or with respect to railways.
The list of things that have happened -- we categorise them under two heads, productivity related and investment related. It is a long list of things that have happened. I will quote a phrase that the PM used and go beyond the cliché over here is that he doesn’t have a big vision because he is involved in doing the small things. Like if that simple announcement about Visas brings about a lot of change in the system. I think a lot of us in the markets tend to focus on big bang announcements.

Maruti Suzuki , India’s largest carmaker, notched up domestic passenger vehicle sales of 99,290 in September, data released by the firm today show, 9.8 percent higher than the 90,399 units sold in the same month last year.
The company’s exports, however, fell 28.2 percent year-on-year to 10,452 units from 14,565 last September, bringing the total monthly sales tally to 1,09,742 units (up 4.6 percent overall).
The company’s sales were driven by sales in what industry body SIAM classifies as the compact segment (Swift, Ritz, Celerio, DZire), which rose 18.1 percent to 43,304 unit. The segment usually accounts for nearly half the carmaker’s sales.
Part of the higher sales in the segment can be attributed to the successful semi-automatic Celerio, which launched in January this year.
Sales for the mini car segment (Alto, Wagon R) fell 13.4 percent to 35,547 units. However, at least some of the fall can be explained by the fact that the company is no longer selling the Estilo and the 800 mini cars that it was selling in September last year.
The recently-launched Ciaz saw sales of 1,375 units (though the car has received over 3,000 bookings, the company recently said). Sales numbers provided by companies are based on dispatches to dealers rather than outright sales to end customers.
The utility vehicle segment, comprising of the Ertiga and Gypsy, grew a whopping 125 percent to 5,980.
Vans (Eeco and Omni) too notched up sales of 11,863 units, 35.3 percent higher than last year.
Over the first half of this financial year (April-September), Maruti Suzuki has domestically sold a total of 5,58,330 units, 14.7 percent higher than in the same period last year.
This is in line with other signs of a rebound in auto sales, consistent with expectations of a general pick-up in economic activity.
Maruti is trying to expand its footprint in the Indian auto market by venturing into areas it has not succeeded or entered previously.
The Ciaz, which is off to a decent start, is the company's latest attempt to crack the midsize sedan market, which it has failed to in its previous attempts with the Baleno and the SX4.
Likewise, chairman RC Bhargava has said the company is working on launching a compact SUV, which would compete with the likes of the Ford EcoSport and the Renault Duster. Its previous SUV, the Grand Vitara, never sold in a big way, thanks in part to the fact that it was imported as a built-unit, which ratcheted up its price in a big way.
Maruti is also looking to enter the light commercial vehicle segment in mid 2015, Bhargava told CNBC-TV18 in a recent interview .
Maruti Suzuki stock price
On November 24, 2014, Maruti Suzuki India closed at Rs 3346.05, down Rs 2.75, or 0.08 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 3397.60 and the 52-week low was Rs 1541.25.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 102.82 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 32.54. The latest book value of the company is Rs 694.45 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 4.82.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today wielded a broom here to launch his pet Swachh Bharat mission, a cleanliness drive across India, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
After paying tributes at the memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri on their birth anniversaries, Modi himself swept a pavement at Valmiki Basti, a colony of sanitation workers here, before the formal launch of the 'Clean India' drive at Rajpath.
While launching the mission at Mandir Marg here, he also made a surprise visit at the local police station to check on cleanliness. Accompanied by officials, the Prime Minister collected the garbage and put it in a bin. He later interacted with the children there. "I bow to Mahatma Gandhi on his birth anniversary.... Gandhi ji's thoughts and beliefs remain a great inspiration for us. Let us dedicate ourselves to building the India of Gandhi ji's dreams," he said in a series of tweets.
He also recalled Shastri's famous 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' slogan. He began his day by paying tributes to Gandhi at Raj Ghat and Lal Bahadur Shastri at Vijay Ghat. About 31 lakh central government employees across the country took a pledge of cleanliness in various public functions organised today as part of Modi government's 'Clean India' mission. In addition, lakhs of state government employees have been asked to be part of this massive drive.

PTI Mohan Bhagwat
New Delhi, Oct 3:  
A controversy broke out today over the live telecast by state broadcaster of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s address at Nagpur with Congress and Left parties slamming the “misuse” of Doordarshan but BJP defended it.
Congress spokesman Sandeep Dikshit termed the hour-long telecast as a “dangerous tradition”, saying RSS is a controversial religious and political organisation.
“It is a dangerous tradition. This is not an organisation which is completely neutral. It is a controversial organisation,” he said, adding it is a political decision of the government.
Congress leader Rashid Alvi said, “this naked state majoritarianism must be resisted.”
Former Union Minister Salman Khurshid said, “We do not accept the record of RSS as being above board in terms of our national aspirations“.
Condemning the live broadcast, CPI(M) said, “The RSS uses the occasion propagate its Hindutva ideology. The national public broadcaster has no business to telecast live the speech of the Chief of an organisation like the RSS.”
The CPI also condemned the live telecast with its National Secretary D Raja saying the government, particularly the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, should give an explanation to the people for allowing DD to be the mouthpiece for the RSS.
He said it was “a disquieting and distressing trend that the country’s secular and democratic values were undermined by the government action.
Historian and commentator Ramchandra Guha said this “naked state majoritarianism” must be resisted.
“This (showing it live) is a dangerous misuse of the state machinery. The RSS is a sectarian Hindu body. Next, imams in mosques and priests in churches may ask that DD covers their speeches live,” he said in his tweets.
Defending the telecast, BJP’s Shaina N C said the RSS is only a nationalist organisation which believes in ‘India first’ and the country above the interest of any individual.
“I am glad that this speech has been highlighted and people realise that if there is one cadre in the country today that has genuinely contributed to patriotism and nation-building, it is the RSS,” she said.

Travel industry body International Air Transport Association (IATA) Friday said India’s domestic market increased by 7.4 per cent in August over 2013.
“Results for the last two months have been solid, perhaps an early sign of improvement as a result of the new business-supportive government regime,” IATA said in a statement.
According to IATA, India’s domestic demand rose 4.5 per cent in the month under review compared to August 2013.
“August was a good month right across the industry. All regions reported an expansion in demand for air travel. We should, however, keep an eye on potential downside risks,” said Tony Tyler, director general and chief executive, IATA.
Data furnished by the civil aviation ministry, showed that domestic air passenger traffic increased by 8.31 per cent in August to 56.97 lakh passengers-up from 52.60 lakh ferried in the corresponding month last year.
On a month-on-month basis there was an increase of over five per cent in the passenger traffic.
“Passengers carried by domestic airlines during Jan-Aug 2014 were 433.25 lakh as against 411.40 lakh during the corresponding period of previous year, thereby registering a growth of 5.31 per cent,” the ministry had said in a statement.
The data showed that low-cost carrier IndiGo achieved the highest market share at 32.6 per cent followed by SpiceJet at 19.5 per cent, Air India at 16.2 per cent, Jet Airways at 16.1 per cent, Go Air at 10 per cent, and JetLite at 4 per cent.

UN condemns beheading of British aid worker by ISISUN condemns beheading of British aid worker by ISIS
PTI
Tweet
United Nations, Oct 4:  
Strongly condemning the “heinous and cowardly” murder of a British humanitarian aid worker by the Islamic State group, the UN Security Council today stressed that the terror outfit must be defeated.
The 15-nation Council said that the killing of Alan Henning, is a tragic reminder of the increasing dangers volunteer humanitarian personnel face every day in Syria.
It also once again demonstrates the brutality of ISIS or ISIL, which is responsible for thousands of abuses against the Syrian and Iraqi people.
“The members of the Security Council stressed again that ISIL must be defeated and that the intolerance, violence and hatred it espouses must be stamped out,” the powerful UN body said in a press statement.
The 47-year-old from Manchester in northwest England had volunteered to help drive an aid convoy to Syria for a Muslim charity, and was kidnapped 10 months ago.
He is the fourth Western hostage killed in the same manner in roughly two-week intervals since August by the ISIS.
Expressing their deep sympathy and condolences to Henning’s family, the Council members emphasized that continued acts of barbarism perpetrated by ISIL do not intimidate them, but rather stiffen their resolve that there has to be a common effort among Governments and institutions, including those in the region most affected, to counter ISIL, Al-Nusra Front and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with al-Qaeda.
The Council stressed that those responsible for the killing of Henning shall be held accountable, and urged the international community to cooperate actively with the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland in this regard.
The members of the Security Council also recalled their condemnation of all forms of violence and intimidation to which those participating in humanitarian operations are increasingly exposed.
Terming any acts of terrorism as “criminal and unjustifiable,” the UNSC demanded the immediate, safe and unconditional release of all those who are kept hostage by ISIL and the Al-Nusra Front and underlined the need to bring perpetrators of the “reprehensible” acts of terrorism to justice.

Islamic State militants behead British aid worker in new videoNew ISIS video shows beheading of British hostage
AP
print
An internet video released on Friday shows an Islamic State group fighter beheading British hostage Alan Henning, the fourth such killing carried out by the extremist group now targeted in US-led airstrikes.
The video mirrored other beheading videos shot by the Islamic State group, which now holds territory along the border of Syria and Iraq, and ended with a militant threatening a man they identified as an American named Peter Kassig.
"Obama, you have started your aerial bombardment of Shams (Syria), which keeps on striking our people, so it is only right that we continue to strike the neck of your people," the masked militant in the video said.
National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden confirmed that Kassig was being held by Islamic State militants, in a statement issued on Friday evening.
"At this point we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video released earlier today (Friday). We will continue to use every tool at our disposal - military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence - to try to bring Peter home to his family," Hayden said.
The Associated Press could not immediately verify the video's authenticity, though it was released in the same manner as other Islamic State group videos and the masked militant sounded similar to the one who carried out the other slayings.

Britain has been supporting US military efforts against the Islamic State group by using British forces to help with logistics and intelligence gathering, as well as recently taking part in airstrikes in Iraq. The internet video released Friday begins with a news clip announcing British strikes against the Islamic State group.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said Henning's apparent slaying showed "how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are."
"Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need," Cameron said in a statement. "The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these... terrorists.
"We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice."
President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, said the US had seen the video and was evaluating it.

Later, Obama said the United States strongly condemned Henning's "brutal murder." He said the US, along with Britain and other allies, will "work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder" to justice and will continue to "taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic State group.
French President Francois Hollande said he is "outraged by the heinous crime."
"This crime like previous ones will not be unpunished. France will continue to lend support to the people and authorities of Iraq in their fight against terrorism," Hollande said in a statement.
On Friday night, the UN Security Council condemned the video, saying it "once again illustrates the brutality" of the Islamic State group, adding that its members believe "such continued acts of barbarism perpetrated by ISIL do not intimidate them but rather stiffen their resolve."
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group. The full beheadings are not shown in the videos, but the British-accented, English-speaking militant holds a long knife and appears to begin cutting his victims, who include American reporter James Foley, American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and now Henning.
FBI director James Comey has said American officials believe they know the identity of the masked militant, though he's declined to name the man or reveal his nationality.
Kassig, a 26-year-old American now threatened by the Islamic State group, enlisted in the Army in 2004, and became a Ranger, ultimately serving in the 75th Ranger Regiment, an Army special operations unit.
According to his military record, Kassig trained at Fort Benning, Georgia in 2006, and deployed to Iraq from April to July 2007. He was medically discharged at the rank of private first class in September 2007. His home of record at the time of his enlistment was Indianapolis, Indiana.
His parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, issued a statement through a media relations firm, asking for the world to pray for their son.
"The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning. We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration," the statement said. "We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe."
The family said Kassig had been working for the relief organization SERA when he was captured on October 1, 2013 on his way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria. He converted to Islam while in captivity and the family has heard from former hostages that his faith has provided him comfort.
Henning, 47, nicknamed "Gadget," had joined an aid convoy and was taken captive on December 26, shortly after crossing the border between Turkey and Syria. Earlier this week, Henning's wife Barbara Henning asked the militants in a televised plea: "Please release him. We need him back home."
Dozens of Muslim leaders in Britain have urged the Islamic State group to release Henning. His wife had said she had been given hope by "the outcry across the world" over her husband's imprisonment.
Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Henning "a British hero."
His "barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world," Shafiq said.
The Islamic State group has its roots in al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody 3-year civil war in neighbouring Syria, growing stronger to the point of being able to launch a lightning offensive across much of northern Iraq, routing security forces there and shooting down an Iraqi helicopter on Friday. The group has become known for filming and releasing footage of mass shootings it conducts, as well as beheading opponents and targeting religious and ethnic minorities in the areas it attacks.
The extremist group has been widely denounced by mainstream Muslim authorities.
Other foreigners are believed held by the Islamic State group. On Friday, the father of John Cantlie, a British photojournalist held by the group, appealed for his release in a video, saying he was a friend of Syria.

PM Modi to kick off campaign in Maharashtra todayPM Modi to kick off campaign in Maharashtra today
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 04, 2014
First Published: 00:52 IST(4/10/2014) | Last Updated: 10:40 IST(4/10/2014)
Comments
After its split with long-time ally Shiv Sena and facing a multi-cornered contest for most seats, the BJP in Maharashtra is looking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to work his magic with voters before the October 15 election.
The party, which has not projected any state leader for chief minister, plans to organise two dozen rallies by Modi at carefully chosen locations across the state, beginning Saturday.
Before the “Sinh Garjana “ at the city’s Mahalaxmi Race Course in the evening, the PM will address two rallies in central Maharashtra, at Beed and Aurangabad. On Sunday, he will visit Kolhapur in western Maharashtra, Gondia in eastern Vidarbha, and Nashik in north Maharashtra. Modi is expected to address at least 18 more rallies, including two in the city, before campaigning ends on October 13. 
 
Mumbai is crucial for the BJP after it broke with the Sena, which now accuses it of betraying the sons of the soil. The BJP has several non-Marathi candidates in the city; it claims to have fielded Marathi candidates in proportion to the community’s share of the electorate.
 
The Sena has questioned the BJP’s bid to hijack Chhatrapati Shivaji. The BJP’s main slogan reads ‘Chhatrapatincha Ashirvaad, Chala Deu Modina Saath’ (seek Chhatrapati’s blessings and support Modi). The MNS has joined the Sena in slamming the BJP over this issue.
The BJP national president Amit Shah, the Sena’s main target, has deputed leaders from all ethnic communities to win voters over.
 
The party’s headquarters is flooded with requests for Modi rallies. To begin with, the PM will visit central Maharashtra, also known as Marathwada, where the BJP won only two seats in the 2009 assembly polls. Winning more in this region is crucial for the BJP’s hopes for power.
 
Modi will also travel to Kolhapur, in the state’s sugar belt, to target the NCP, which holds sway there, but faces a threat from the BJP’s ally, the Raju Shetti-led Swambhimani Shetkari Paksha. This will also help the BJP in neighbouring Sangli where it has three MLAs and a Lok Sabha member who ended the Congress’ undefeated run in May this year.
 
Eastern Vidarbha’s Gondia is the pocketborough of the senior NCP leader Praful Patel who, despite losing his Lok Sabha seat to the BJP, plans to bounce back. Nashik in north Maharashtra is the MNS’ stronghold, which the BJP will try to capture.

Govt s decision to axe Planning Commission leaves officers  careers in limboYou are here: Home > Collections
Officials in a fix after withdrawal of notification regarding the constitution of the Planning Commission
Yogima Sharma, ET Bureau Oct 4, 2014, 11.03AM IST

Manmohan Singh
(The dismal state of affairs…)
NEW DELHI: Careers of several senior bureaucrats of the Planning Commission have been in limbo since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address, sounded the death knell for the 64-year old institution that formulated five-year plans and influenced policy decisions during its heyday.
The promotion of a joint advisor, who has had a record of outstanding performance throughout his career, has got stuck at the highest level while another senior officer, who has put in 10 years in the commission, has been waiting for her cadre to place her out. "My promotion within the commission was cleared by the top brass here but got stuck at the Cabinet level because the government has decided to wind up the institution itself. This is despite an outstanding performance each year in more than two decades of service," the joint advisor told ET on condition of anonymity.
The dismal state of affairs is evident in the corridors of Yojana Bhawan, headquarters of the commission, where officers have neither much work nor any growth prospects in sight. "I have been requesting my cadre to take me out of the commission, but they are waiting to see what the new government does with the several economic service officers working here," said an advisor in the commission.
The Cabinet declared last month that the notification regarding the constitution of the Planning Commission stands withdrawn. There are at least 200 officers, at the rank of advisors, joint advisors and directors, in the commission out of the total staff strength of nearly 1,000. "No ministry officials are now seeking our views on the draft Cabinet notes. It is only the final Cabinet note that comes to us, that too very rarely, leave alone our views on policy matters," another advisor in the commission said.According to several officers, the most disappointing thing is that even the planning secretary Sindhushree Khullar has not even once, directly or indirectly conveyed to them that she will stand by her team to ensure that all members are well placed.
"She is in the Prime Minister's Office several times a day, almost every day, but not even once has she communicated with us on what lies ahead for us," said an officer, requesting not to be named. The PMO has roped in Khullar to resolve interministerial issues of infrastructure and sanitation. She has presented all infrastructure reviews in the past four months and played a key role in the roll-out of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on Thursday.
Khullar did not respond to an email query sent by ET.NC Saxena, a former secretary of the Planning Commission said that the officers, being government employees, need not worry for their salaries even if they did not have much work in the interim period. "However, since the new institution is likely to be thinner, they will either have to go back to their cadres or get absorbed in other ministries," he said.
Although the government has sought suggestions of experts and public as well as the erstwhile commission through a Cabinet note, it is yet to firm up its view on the new institution that will replace the commission. Arun Maira, member in the previous commission said that the government ought to act fast or else it might have to backtrack on the idea.
"The government needs to quickly define the structure of the new institution and figure out how much of its manpower requirement could be fulfilled by the existing officials," he said. "The inertia in the existing system is so strong that if you delay the process for long there is a possibility that the government will have to reverse its decision or we may end up getting a diluted version of the institution envisaged by them," Maira added, citing the example of the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO). The IEO was set up through a Cabinet order after the approval of the National Development Council.
However, the Modi-led NDA government, which took charge in May, closed down the IEO and decided to strengthen the Programme Evaluation Organisation, which has existed since 1952. The Planning Commission played a key role, most recently during the tenure of the previous UPA government, largely because of the closeness between its then deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and then PM Manmohan Singh.
 
The institution, which determined allocation of planned funds to states, influenced policy decisions especially with regard to infrastructure sectors. This resulted in a lot of discontent among various ministries that often criticised the commission for its overarching role. Ahluwalia could not be reached for comment.

Woman with a new womb gives birth to baby

London: In a medical first, a woman in Sweden has given birth after receiving a womb transplant, the doctor who performed the pioneering procedure said on Friday.
The 36-year-old mother received a uterus from a close family friend last year. Her baby boy was born prematurely but healthy last month, and mother and child are now at home and doing well. The identities of the woman and her husband were not disclosed.
"The baby is fantastic," said Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Gothenburg and Stockholm IVF who led the research and delivered the baby with the help of his wife, a midwife. "But it is even better to see the joy in the parents and how happy he made them."
The feat opens up a new but still experimental alternative for some of the thousands of women each year who are unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one.

Brannstrom said it was "still sinking in that we have actually done it."
The feat opens up a new but still experimental alternative for some of the thousands of women each year who are unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one. Before this case proved the concept can work, some experts had questioned whether a transplanted womb would be able to nourish a fetus.
Others have questioned whether such an extreme step - expensive and fraught with medical risks - would even be a realistic option for many women.
Dr. Glenn Schattman, past president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies and a Cornell University fertility specialist, said womb transplants are likely to remain very uncommon.
"This would not be done unless there were no other options," he said. "It requires a very long surgery and not without risk and complications."
For the proud parents, the years of research and experimentation were well worth the wait.
"It was a pretty tough journey over the years, but we now have the most amazing baby," the father said in a telephone interview. "He is very, very cute, and he doesn't even scream, he just murmurs."
He said he and his wife, both competitive athletes, were convinced the procedure would work, despite its experimental nature.
Brannstrom and colleagues transplanted wombs into nine women over the last two years as part of a study, but complications forced removal of two of the organs. Earlier this year, Brannstrom began transferring embryos into the seven other women. He said there are two other pregnancies at least 25 weeks along.
Before these cases, there had been two attempts to transplant a womb - in Saudi Arabia and Turkey - but no live births resulted. Doctors in Britain, France, Japan, Turkey and elsewhere are planning to try similar operations, but using wombs from women who have just died instead of from live donors.
The Swedish woman had healthy ovaries, but she was born without a uterus - a syndrome seen in one girl in 4,500. She received a uterus from a 61-year-old family friend who had gone through menopause after giving birth to two children.
Brannstrom said that he was surprised such an old uterus was so successful, but that the most important factor seemed to be that the womb was healthy.
The recipient has had to take three medicines to prevent her body from rejecting the new organ. About six weeks after the transplant, she got her menstrual period - a sign the womb was healthy.
After one year, when doctors were confident the womb was working well, they transferred a single embryo created in a lab dish using the woman's eggs and her husband's sperm.
The woman, who has only one kidney, had three mild rejection episodes, including one during pregnancy, but all were successfully treated with medicines. The research was paid for by the Jane and Dan Olsson Foundation for Science, a Swedish charity.
The baby's growth and blood flow to the womb and umbilical cord were normal until the 31st week of pregnancy, when the mother developed a dangerous high-blood-pressure condition called preeclampsia.
After an abnormal fetal heart rate was detected, the baby was delivered by cesarean section. He weighed 3.9 pounds - normal for that stage of pregnancy. Full gestation is about 40 weeks. The baby was released from the neonatal unit 10 days after birth.
"He's no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell," the father said. "One day he can look at the newspaper articles about how he was born and know that he was the first in the world" to be born this way.
Details of the case are to be published soon in the journal Lancet.
Some critics have said that taking a womb from a live person is unethical and too big a risk to the donor for an operation that isn't life-saving. But Brannstrom said there were too few deceased donors to consider that option in Sweden.
"Most couples will do just about anything to have a baby. We need to see this happen a little bit more and see how safe it is," said Dr. Nanette Santoro, obstetrics chief at the University of Colorado in Denver. "It's not clear to me how many women would choose this, because it seems pretty arduous."
Brannstrom said he was concerned he might have hurt the womb during the C-section and said they would have to wait a couple of months before knowing if the mother would be able to keep the uterus for a second pregnancy.
For the new parents, the thought of a second baby right now is a little premature.
"We will definitely think about that," the father said. "But right now, we're very happy with just one baby."

Pakistan detects record number of poliocasesPrint
Associated Press | Islamabad | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:16 pm
A health official in Pakistan says authorities already have detected a record number of polio cases this year, blaming militants for the outbreak.
Rana Mohammad Safdar, a senior official at the National Institute of Health in Islamabad, said on Saturday that doctors have discovered 202 cases this year alone. The previous modern record was 199 cases in 2001.
Safdar says six out of eight cases are in northwest Pakistan, where it’s impossible to launch anti-polio drive because of threats from militants.
The Taliban have banned immunizations and attacked polio vaccination teams. Militants accuse polio workers of acting as spies for the United States after the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden and claim the vaccine makes boys sterile.
Pakistan is one of three countries where polio is endemic.

AP | Seoul | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:36 pm
North Korea’s presumptive No. 2 led members of Pyongyang’s inner circle on a rare trip Saturday to South Korea for the close of the Asian Games, with the rivals holding their highest level face-to-face talks in five years.
After months of tensions, including a steady stream of insults between the divided neighbors and an unusual number of North Korean missile and rocket test firings, expectations for a breakthrough weren’t high, but even the visit itself was significant, allowing valuable contact between confidants of North Korea’s authoritarian leader and Seoul’s senior official for North Korean affairs.
One analyst called it a “golden opportunity” for South Korean President Park Geun-hye to test North Korea’s willingness, at the highest levels, to improve shaky ties, but it seemed unlikely that Park would meet with the aides to North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un.
The North Korean delegation to the games in the South Korean port city of Incheon was led by Hwang Pyong So, the top political officer for the Korean People’s Army and considered by outside analysts to be the country’s second most important official after Kim. Hwang is also a vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission led by Kim and a vice marshal of the army.
The visit comes amid rumors in Seoul about the health of Kim, who has made no public appearances since Sept. 3 and skipped a high-profile recent event he usually attends. A recent official documentary showed footage from August of him limping and overweight and mentioned his “discomfort.”
It wasn’t immediately clear what Hwang and his delegation talked about in a closed-door lunch meeting with South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae and national security director Kim Kwan-jin. Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong Cheol told reporters that there were no plans for the North Koreans to meet with President Park.
That could be a mistake, an American analyst in Seoul said. This visit of “a very high-octane group” offers Park a unique chance “to test the North Korean leadership’s will and intentions,” said John Delury, an Asia specialist at Seoul’s Yonsei University.
“Historically, North-South breakthroughs start from the top down, and if Park is serious that she wants to improve relations and jumpstart the reunification process, this is a golden opportunity,” he said.
Both sides expressed hope for better relations in comments to the media ahead of the talks.
The success at the Asian Games for both countries, which were in the top 10 for gold medals, is a source of pride for all Koreans, said one of the North Korean officials, Kim Yang Gon, a secretary in the ruling Workers’ Party and senior official responsible for South Korean affairs, according to the YTN TV network.

Ebola outbreak running ahead of worlds response: UNofficialPress Trust of India | United Nations | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:24 pm
Terming the spread of the Ebola virus an “unprecedented situation”, a top UN official said that despite best efforts, the outbreak is “running” ahead of the world’s response to curtail it and funding for the international response is also lagging.
Despite best efforts, “the (Ebola) virus is running faster than the international community,” World Food Programme (WFP) Regional Director Denise Brown said, adding concerted efforts to get the virus under control had not succeeded.
“(The virus) is way ahead of us”, she said.
Calling it an unprecedented situation, Brown urged the international community to take exceptional measures to collectively get in front of the virus and to stop it.
The head of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), Anthony Banbury, is in Sierra Leone on the second leg of his visit to the most affected countries, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters here yesterday.
Banbury is in West Africa to jump start UNMEER’s work.
After arriving at the mission’s headquarters in Accra, Ghana, earlier this week, he spent the past two days assessing the situation in Liberia.
Regarding the funding of the response, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that 26 per cent, or just USD 256 million, of the total USD 988 million needed, has been received.
An additional USD 163 million has been pledged to activities in the plan that covers immediate humanitarian support to the region, particularly Guinea, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone.
The UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has so far committed USD 13.4 million to support food and health operations as well as the regional humanitarian air service.
WFP is delivering food, planes, helicopters, ships, and flying in aid workers but the virus is spreading exponentially, and the response must increase accordingly.
The agency is building two treatment centres in Monrovia which should be ready by the end of October with 400 beds. But several other components must align, the world body said.

Coal mines auction policy and methodology being revisited
The Ministry said that the IMC may consist of the ministries of power, steel, law and Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion.
Post your opinion here
 
The policy of coal mines auction and methodology is being revisited under the direction of Advisory Council headed by Suresh Prabhu. The Coal Ministry which is awaiting the recommendations of the council will finalise the policy with changes within a month, the coal ministry said in its latest communique to Coal and Power Minister Piyush Goyal on the future course of action following the Supreme court's judgement on coal mines.
The apex court had last month quashed the allocation of 214 coal blocks allotted to various companies since 1993. "The auction policy and methodology earlier approved by the CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) is being revisited under the guidance of the Advisory Council headed by Suresh Prabhu," the communique said.
"The ministry is awaiting their recommendations and finalise the auction policy/methodology with modifications within a period of one month," it said. The ministry also informed the minister that a there is a proposal to form an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, Coal to explore all options on the way forward in light of the judgement of the Supreme Court.
The Ministry said that the IMC may consist of the ministries of power, steel, law and Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion. The Cabinet had in September last year approved the methodology for auctioning coal blocks, providing for upfront and production-linked payments and benchmarking of coal sale prices.
The erstwhile UPA government had in February issued notice inviting applications, offering three coal blocks for mining to companies engaged in production of steel, cement and sponge iron through competitive bidding.
However, the government later cancelled the auction, stating issues related to certain clearances need to be "revisited". The former UPA government had drawn flak for delaying auction.

Married at one, child bride's story is now CBSE lesson
When Lakshmi of Luni village of Jodhpur district had just attained the age of one, she was married to three-year-old boy Rakesh of Satlana village 20 years back.
Mail Today –  Fri 3 Oct, 2014
Print
JAIPUR: The story of a young woman in Jodhpur, who got her child marriage legally annulled with the help of an NGO in 2012, has been included in the CBSE book for Human Rights and Gender Studies – a subject introduced for Class XI and XII from this academic session.
When Lakshmi of Luni village of Jodhpur district had just attained the age of one, she was married to three-year-old boy Rakesh of Satlana village 20 years back.
And it was this marriage that came as a rude shock to Lakshmi when at the age of 16 she understood its importance. Till then, she had been considering herself as unmarried.
By that time she also came to know about some "negative images and bad habits" of her in-laws and her "husband".
This prompted Lakshmi, an illiterate, and her brother Hanuman, to resist the ceremony of 'Gauna' on the "auspicious day" of Akshaya Tritiya.
Gauna is a ritual when the bride is sent to her in-laws' home forever.
Around that time Lakshmi and her brother watched an interview of Kriti Bharti, a rehabilitation psychologist and managing trustee of Saarthi Trust, about the social evil of child marriage on a Jodhpur-based television channel.
They sought her help.
"I was unhappy about the marriage. I had told my parents but they didn't agree. Then I sought the help," Lakshmi recalled.
"Initially I thought to stop or delay the 'Gauna' by counselling and legal procedures," Bharti told Mail Today.
"But Lakshmi was not satisfied with this step. Lakshmi asked what she would do after a few months when her in-laws would come again to take her to their home forever."
This prompted her to look for a permanent solution. Bharti studied the legal provisions and came across a provision of child marriage annulment.
After consulting some of the judges, lawyers and government law officials, she decided to take the legal recourse and came out with flying colours.
The marriage was annulled following the consent of Rakesh, the husband, on April 24, 2012 when both Lakshmi and Rakesh signed an affidavit declaring the marriage null and void in the presence of a notary public in Jodhpur.
According to Bharti, it was the first example of a couple married in childhood wanting the marriage to be annulled.
"Only after the legal success I came to know that the case had created history," she added.
Initially Rakesh wanted to go ahead with the marriage, but relented after counselling by Bharti.
Besides the two families, she also counselled Lakshmi and Rakesh to help them move forward in life.
Lakshmi's story has been included as a case study in Chapter 2: Gender Related Issues, under the subtitle of 'Indian Teenager Annuls Her Child Marriage' on page 207 of the book for class XI.
However, what the book misses is the fact that after attaining majority Lakshmi got remarried, nay married, on January 31, 2013 to Mahendra Sargara, the husband of her choice.
She is now a happy homemaker living with her husband in Rohat village of Pali district.

Only big-bang reforms may fuel next mkt rallyfmcg
(The rally, which was triggered…)
In an interview with ET Now, Nirmal Jain, Chairman, IIFL Group, talks about the market and shares his macroeconomic outlook. Excerpts:
ET Now: A lot has happened in the past two or three weeks. We have had the policy out of the way. The US visit has happened. We have had the Indian Prime Minister meeting the Chinese President as well over the last one month. What are your takeaways about what all of this means for the market?
Nirmal Jain: The rally, which was triggered by the euphoria because of change in government, is over. Now the market will consolidate and look for real action on the policy front as well as on the earnings and demand front.
The auto sector is doing well, but FMCG has also caught the attention of investors because commodity prices have corrected and the margins would have expanded there. The rupee is again gradually depreciating.
Earlier in the election phase, we had some populist speeches, which will bring down the value of dollar and the rupee will strengthen. But now the government has realized that allowing the rupee to depreciate gradually is in the best interest of the country. So, export-led companies like IT and pharma are coming back onto investors' radar. Now the rally will be driven more by bottom-up stock picking, actual policy and actual implementation of the projects.
ET Now: What steps should be taken to revive or do away with the jitteriness that investors might be experiencing?
Nirmal Jain: Lots of small things are needed to be done, which will take time because we are a democratic country. The government needs to do some big-bang things to get the investors' confidence back and move up the sentiment.
For instance, PSU bank reforms could have been a big-bang item. People thought that the crisis of bad loans and NPAs will resolve after the election and things will start moving quickly, but that has not happened. Projects still remain stalled. There is very little right now which can change things in the coal sector in the near future after the Supreme Court verdict on coal block allocation.
People thought that 2-3 months is a good enough time for a government which is in a hurry and when things need some urgent attention, they will happen. But it has not happened. At the same time, there are lots of things going on internally. People are working. The government bureaucracy is working much better than what it was working earlier. Ministers are also working. Many of them are new. They are new to politics. They are new to government.
So, most of the investors are still optimistic from a longer-term perspective, but they are not in a hurry to buy because nothing is going to run away now. That runaway part is over and now there will be more action-oriented, more actual result-oriented market and stock picking. That is what we will see now.
ET Now: We are just 20 days shy of this Diwali. Do you expect that a lot of things will be done from this Diwali to the next Diwali and the market will be at significantly higher levels than where it is right now?
Nirmal Jain: In 20 days, nothing dramatic should be expected.
ET Now: No I am talking about from this Diwali and to the next Diwali.
Nirmal Jain: To the next Diwali, yes. I am quite hopeful that lots of things will happen. I am very confident that at least if you look at the government and all the ministers, they seem quite determined that they want to do things.
In one year's time, we will see lots of action. Things will start moving on the investment front. A number of projects will probably take off. The next budget in the month of February will be a proper budget because the finance minister will get a lot more time.
All these uncertainties about re-allocation of coal mines, gas price, and power projects will probably go away. So between this Diwali and the next Diwali, I am quite optimistic that lots of things will happen.
ET Now: And the markets will be higher?
Nirmal Jain: Yes, the markets will be higher, the markets will be a lot more optimistic again.
ET Now: Significantly higher than where we are right now?
Nirmal Jain: I would say that the market already has run up. So maybe the market will see about 20-25% appreciation by the next Diwali.
ET Now: We had the RBI policy, the RBI talking about inflation going down. We also have the global risk of the US interest rates going up at some point of time in 2015 as well. How will all of these tie up and impact the markets over the next six months?
Nirmal Jain: The RBI also had made a forecast of 6.3% GDP growth next year. Normally, the RBI is a bit conservative in its estimates and people would expect it to be. Most of the analysts would probably think that if things get off the ground the way we have just talked about, then the GDP growth next year, with some bit of luck on monsoon and crude prices, may be somewhere between 6.5% and 7%, which will be very positive.

Stock Funds Worldwide Post $10.1 Billion Outflows Over Week: BofA-MLSensex at 30,000 by December End? Yes, Say Analysts
New York: Investors worldwide pulled a net $10.1 billion out of stock funds in the latest week on aversion to risk assets in response to a pullback in US stock prices, data from a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Global Research report showed on Friday.
The outflows, for the week ended October 1, were the biggest in eight weeks, according to the report, which also cited data from fund-tracker EPFR Global.
US-focused stock funds accounted for $9.6 billion of the net outflows, and most of the net outflows came from stock exchange-traded funds, the report showed.
Bond funds attracted a net $9.1 billion in new cash, their biggest in six weeks on account of $10.4 billion in inflows into investment-grade bond funds. Riskier high-yield bond funds posted $3.7 billion in outflows, marking their biggest withdrawals since record outflows in early August, data from the report showed.
The report said, however, that the net inflows into bond funds were "likely overstated" since they did not account for outflows from asset manager Pimco.
The Pimco Total Return Fund, the world's largest bond fund, suffered a record $23.5 billion of withdrawals in September, with its largest daily outflow occurring on the day of former manager Bill Gross's surprise resignation from the firm on September 26.
Funds that specialize in energy stocks accounted for a huge $2.2 billion of the net outflows from stock funds, according to the report. European stock funds posted $1.9 billion in outflows, marking their fifth straight week of withdrawals.
The outflows from stock funds reflect investors' overreaction to some weak economic data over the week, including data showing US manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in September compared to August, said Michael Jones, who oversees $4.7 billion as chief investment officer at RiverFront Investment Group in Richmond, Virginia.
"The normal two steps forward, one step back mechanism of the market has been disrupted by quantitative easing, so people are hyper-sensitive to what I would consider to be a very small pullback in a larger bull market," he said.
Mr Jones said investors poured cash into bond funds in a reach for safety and as a higher-yielding alternative to cash. He said the outflows from energy-focused funds likely stemmed from recent pressure on oil prices.
The benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell about 3.2 per cent from a record intraday high on September 19 through October 1. The Federal Reserve is on track to end its massive stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, by October.
Funds that specialize in emerging market stocks attracted a meager $79 million, but emerging markets debt funds posted $400 million in outflows, marking their first withdrawals in six weeks.
Investors continued to avoid floating-rate debt funds and pulled $1.2 billion out of the funds, marking their biggest outflows in eight weeks.

New Delhi: Air India's spate of trouble with its Dreamliner fleet continued on Friday as the airline was forced to cancel its Melbourne-Delhi flight and delay the departure of its Singapore-Chennai service by over six hours.
While the Melbourne-Delhi flight AI-301 had clogged toilets in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and had to be grounded at the Australian city, the other aircraft of the same make, operating flight AI-347 developed technical trouble at Singapore and reached Chennai on Friday evening, instead of its scheduled arrival time of 1050 hours, airline sources said.
Many passengers of the Melbourne flight were given hotel accommodation, while some others were put on alternate flights after the cancellation, they said. The airline had to arrange a team of alternate crew members as the flight duty time limitation (FDTL) for those already on board had come to an end, the sources said.
While the Melbourne-Delhi flight AI-301 had clogged toilets in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the other aircraft developed technical trouble.
#airindia #dreamliner #ai 301 #melbourne delhi
The recurrent problems with the Dreamliners is understood to have figured in the one-on-on meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi had with Boeing CEO W James McNerney on September 29 in Washington. Air India Chairman Rohit Nandan was also in Washington during Modi's meeting, after which McNerney told reporters that Boeing wanted to "accelerate engagement with India".
The national carrier and the planemaker are negotiating a formula for compensation for grounding of the Dreamliners for almost four months last year over battery fires, loss of revenue due to recurrent technical problems and resultant adverse publicity to the airline, apart from the demand for initial deliveries not being as fuel-efficient as promised.
Friday's twin incidents involving the Dreamliners came in the wake of similar instances in the recent past, with a Boeing 787 returning to base here after almost three hours of flight to London on Thursday after problems with its air- conditioning system.
Last week, another such aircraft developed a crack on the windshield while it was on ground. Till June-end, there were 318 cases of delays in flights operated by the Dreamliners due to technical snags, according to official figures.

Microsoft says Samsung owes $6.9 mn in unpaid interest on patentroyaltiesPrint
Reuters | San Francisco | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:45 pm
Microsoft Corp is demanding $6.9 million interest from Samsung Electronics in a dispute over smartphone patent royalties, according to a lawsuit unsealed by a New York federal court on Friday.
Microsoft is asking the court to rule that it did not breach a business collaboration agreement with Samsung, and that Samsung must pay interest on more than $1 billion in royalty payments which it delayed in protest at Microsoft’s planned purchase of rival Nokia’s handset business.
A redacted version of the lawsuit was filed by Microsoft in August.
Samsung made royalty payments on time to Microsoft during the first fiscal year after they signed their 2011 agreement, the lawsuit said.
However, after Microsoft announced the Nokia deal in September 2013, Samsung initially refused to make another payment, arguing that the Nokia deal breached its licensing agreement with Microsoft. It eventually paid late without adding interest, according to the lawsuit.
Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Microsoft has successfully argued that Google Inc’s Android mobile system uses some of its technology, and as a result most hardware makers, including Samsung, have agreed to pay patent royalties on Android handsets.
Motorola is one of the main holdouts, and that company has been in litigation against Microsoft since 2010.
The lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York is Microsoft Corp vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 14-6039.

Two police officers involved in probing the alleged hate speech by BJP president Amit Shah in Muzaffarnagar and filing the chargesheet against him have been transferred by the UP government.
The state police, however, maintained that the transfers of DSP (New Mandi Circle) Yogender Singh and sub-inspector Bharat Lal were part of a routine affair and had nothing to do with the case against Shah. A Muzaffarnagar court had rejected the chargesheet in the case, terming it “erroneous”.
“While Singh has been shifted to police lines from Circle of New Mandi, Lal has been transferred to Bhorakala Police Station from New Mandi Police Station,” SSP Hari Narayan Singh said.

Errant Taliban tweet claims spokesman inPakistanPrint
Associated Press | Kabul | Posted: October 4, 2014 1:13 pm
An apparently errant tweet by the Taliban’s spokesman in Afghanistan gave his location as being in neighbouring Pakistan.
Yesterday, a tweet by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claiming an attack included geolocation information that suggested he sent the message from Sindh, Pakistan.
Mujahid later sent a tweet today describing the location leak as an “enemy plot.” He also offered his Afghan telephone number to confirm his identity and wrote: “With full confidence, I can say that I am in my own country.”
Twitter says such geolocation data is based on latitude and longitude data or other information provided by users at the time of their message.
In an explanation of geolocation, Twitter itself warns: “Remember, once you post something online, it’s out there for others to see.”

IKEA Unveils Build  in Less Than Five Minutes  FurnitureEmail
If you love IKEA but can’t stand assembling its furniture, listen up.
The Swedish furniture company recently announced that its new living room line — REGISSÖR — will not only require zero tools to assemble, but according to a promotional video, the furniture can be built "in less than five minutes." This comes as big news from a brand notorious for requiring blood, sweat, tears and hours of your life to put together its furniture.
IKEA touts that the time-saving trick is found in its new special wedge dowels that replace the screws, nuts, bolts and other hardware that would typically come with its furniture.
“By making it even easier to assemble our furniture, we want to give people who may find it challenging a new reason for choosing IKEA,” Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA, said in a press release . 
The REGISSÖR line will roll out this month, featuring a bookshelf, cabinets and a coffee table, while the new assembly approach will also be available on the STOCKHOLM sideboard and cabinet. Additional storage units using tool-free assembly are slated for spring 2015.

What Is This  Ello  Everyone s Posting About On Facebookreddit
If you’ve been on Facebook in the last two weeks, you’ve probably noticed at least one of your friends has posted something like this:
i just signed up for ello? idk viva la revolucion i guess! hit me up for an invite! lol
Such a status update leads to a number of natural follow-up questions, some of which I’ll try to answer here.
Seriously, what the hell is Ello and why is everyone on Facebook talking about it?
Ello is a new, ad-free social network that is basically billing itself as the anti-Facebook without actually coming out and saying it.
Anti-Facebook? In what way?
The site goes to great lengths to tell you again and again that it will be ad-free forever and will not sell your data to third parties -- two not-so-subtle jabs at Zuckerberg’s social media giant.
This holier-than-thou mission statement has led to what can only be described as the world’s laziest form of social protest: people signing up for yet another social media site.
So does Ello describe itself specifically as the “anti-Facebook”?
Explicitly, no. For all intents and purposes, yes. When asked specifically about the “anti-Facebook” tag, Ello CEO Paul Budnitz told re/code that Ello isn’t “really anti-anything.” But then again, he also said: “We don’t actually consider Facebook a social network. We think of it as an advertising platform.” And Ello has set up the site so that anyone who disagrees with its mission statement is redirected to Facebook, so yeah.
If you press "I Disagree," you literally go to Facebook.
Do they have an overly emotional “manifesto” posted to their website?
Why, yes they do! Here it is :
Your social network is owned by advertisers.
Every post you share, every friend you make, and every link you follow is tracked, recorded, and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that’s bought and sold.
We believe there is a better way. We believe in audacity. We believe in beauty, simplicity, and transparency. We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership.
We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce, and manipulate — but a place to connect, create, and celebrate life.
You are not a product.
OK, you’re telling me they collect no data?
Well, it is a website after all, so they do collect some. The site collects basic, anonymous data on Ello users as a whole, so it can figure out where users are coming from, generally where they live and how much time they are spending on the site.
But as for the information they keep about you, Ello seems to have done a good job of keeping little to nothing. In Ello’s words, they have “stripped and anoymized” your IP address. You can read more about their approach to data here .
Why is it suddenly everywhere? And how can I join?
Ello existed for around as year as a private social network for around 100 friends, according to Budnitz. Then on Aug. 7, it went semi-public, using a limited-invite system that has created a “where can I get one” mentality among people like me.
The site is now supposedly adding up to 50,000 new people every hour and doubling in size every few days. If you don’t know someone with an invite, you can sign up to be notified when they switch off the invite-only system.
OK, that’s all well and good. But what’s the actual site like?
For a site that’s being billed as the anti-Facebook, it sure looks and feels a lot like an early version of Facebook.  Even the profile pages look similar:
Yes, those are my Big Brother-like eyes.
Besides that, it’s mostly the same stuff. You joke with friends. Share the occasional comical YouTube link. The usual.
Is there anything annoying about the site I should know about?
Yes! In listicle format:
1. You can’t like people’s posts!
2. You almost definitely have more friends (and hence, more potential for fun) on Facebook. Ello is pretty sparse right now.
3. It’s extremely difficult to figure out which of your friends are on Ello. This probably explains why everyone has to take to Facebook to find companionship.
4. The “post” button is so, um, tastefully subtle you could say it’s essentially invisible. I personally had to go on a 15-minute journey just to figure it out, which led to personal protests like this one:
As my frustration grew, I became more and more convinced that Ello was actually just a complex marketing strategy to get me to crawl back to Facebook.
But I eventually figured it out:
It ends up you need to look very carefully...
Would you recommend joining?
If the idea of Facebook selling ads against you sends you into a blind rage, you might as well give Ello a spin. But if it doesn’t, the primary benefit of Ello is probably to cleanse yourself of the hundreds of high school and college Facebook friends you don’t really care about anymore (and start your social media circle anew).
Right now, I have under 20 friends on Ello, and I like them all. We’re having fun. It kind of reminds me of the early days of Facebook.

Clean energy boost: 25 000 villages may go  off the grid  to solve power woesDre
(Renewable energy, particularly…)
NEW DELHI: More than 25,000 villages, which have been waiting in vain for half a century and beyond for the government to provide them with electricity, could soon see light at the end of the tunnel as they go 'off the grid' using novel clean energy solutions. Rather than be dependent on utilities to plug them into the energy network, these villages will get electrified through so-called micro-grids that generate power for their needs. Such off-grid solutions have been successfully deployed in Ghana and Germany, making rural areas self-sufficient in power through the use of clean energy and have captured the imagination of the government and industry alike.
Renewable energy, particularly innovative solutions to India's energy problems, have the strong backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was high on the agenda during his recent US visit.
"To expand the availability of clean energy resources to more people, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi endorsed the proposal to launch Promoting Energy Access through Clean Energy (PEACE), a PACE initiative, to rapidly deploy innovative renewable energy solutions to those who currently lack access to energy," the foreign ministry said in a release last week. PACE or Partnering to Accelerate Entrepreneurship is a US programme. Out of 6 lakh villages in India, about 26,000, mostly in Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar, UP and Jharkhand, have no electricity at all.
Thousands of other villages have a connection that barely works or lights up the lamps for just an hour or two a day. Tata Power is working on a pilot project in Purnia in Bihar in collaboration with the MIT to install a micro grid with a capacity of 1 MW to power 200 households in the region.
"The project should be completed by December this year or January 2015 and the billing would be on a flat monthly rate—Rs 100-200—instead of metering," said Praveer Sinha, Tata Power Delhi Distribution's CEO and managing director. Off-grid solutions could refer to standalone appliances used in lighting, cooking and agriculture as well as those that power village-specific micro grids using one or a combination of renewable energy sources.
For a country that ranks lower than even much smaller African economies such as Libya, Gabon and Trinidad and Tobago in per-capita electricity consumption, according to the World Bank, off-grid solutions can cater to millions of homes without getting bogged down by the complications and inefficiencies of grid-connected electricity. "Ghana and Germany have now what are called 'power independent' villages, which have their own solar-powered micro grids and surplus storage systems.
There's a possibility to cover at least 25,000-30,000 villages in India in a similar manner," said Manoj Kumar Upadhyay, founder chairman and managing director of ACME Group, which is engaged in solar energy solutions. Coal, power and oil minister Piyush Goyal told ET recently about his plan to expand "off-grid solutions".
"On the second day of taking charge, I decided let's do off-grid solutions, particularly for far-flung areas," he said. "I do realise that itis going to be impossible to get grids reaching out all the way there. We'll have to look at some offgrid solutions, some local solutions," Goyal said. Five R&D centres are being set up on power storage, a critical component in implementing off-grid solutions.
Along with the Indian Institute of Technology-Jodhpur under the leadership of Anil Kakodkar, NTPC is conducting a project to set up solar-thermal combination plants, Goyal added. A halving of the cost of production and storage of solar energy over the last few years is also a reason for the increased focus on off-grid solutions, said experts, who peg this market at billions of dollars.
 
"It has been estimated that in India currently there are about 400 million people (about 80 million households) who do not have access to clean commercial energy," said Anish De, partner, infrastructure and government services, at KPMG.
"According to the World Resources Institute, decentralised renewable energy enterprises (DRE) offer an annual market opportunity of $2.04 billion while the solar home lighting (SHS) market is estimated to be $27.4 million a year." De also said the capital investment required for these solutions would be relatively lower than that for regular power projects and that a number of firms are focusing on the area.
The size of the opportunity is also drawing the interest of renewable energy companies such as Suzlon Energy, which are not yet active in the off-grid space. "Off-grid solution is one of the most promising methods of filling the demand-supply gap with distributed generation to supplement grid supply," said Chintan Shah, president, strategic business development at Suzlon.

Govt. denies nod to SIT to challenge Kodnanis bailUpdated: October 4, 2014 11:56 IST
Govt. denies nod to SIT to challenge Kodnani’s bail
Rahi Gaikwad
crime, law and justice
Gujarat government says the HC judgment is proper.
The Gujarat government has denied permission to the Supreme Court- appointed Special Investigation Team to challenge the grant of bail to Maya Kodnani, former minister accused in the 2002 Naroda Patiya riots case.
The Gujarat High Court had granted bail to Ms. Kodnani in July on the grounds of her ill health.
“We took the decision 20 days ago and conveyed it to the SIT. We decided not to grant permission to the SIT to file an appeal according to the merits of the case, and the facts and circumstance surrounding it. We felt the HC judgment was proper. We have also cited from a Supreme Court judgment to support our decision,” Law and Justice Secretary V P Patel told The Hindu on the phone.
The SIT had sought the opinion of Prashant Desai, Special Public Prosecutor, about going in appeal against the High Court’ bail order.
“I gave my opinion that the chances of success were low and moreover her health is very bad. The SIT was then required to seek permission from the government,” Mr. Desai told The Hindu.
The Naroda Patiya massacre took place on February 28, 2002, as part of the overall riots in Gujarat in the aftermath of the Sabarmati Express train burning incident. Over 90 people were killed and several people were injured in the incident. A special investigation team (SIT) court had convicted and sentenced Ms. Kodnani to 28 years imprisonment in August 2012.

Used stun grenade found on PM Modi s standby aircraftComments
A dummy stun grenade was found on Saturday aboard an Air India Boeing 747 aircraft, one of two standby planes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent US visit.
As it turned out, the fake grenade had been used by the National Security Guard (NSG) for an ‘aircraft intervention drill’ a day after the PM’s departure, when the plane was released for commercial use and flown to Mumbai.
But given that such a lapse took place on an aircraft that was to serve as a replacement for Air India One if the need arose, the incident has exposed a gaping hole in the country’s aviation safety.
After its release to Air India on September 25, the double-decker plane flew on the Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah route on Friday and landed in the Saudi Arabian city early Saturday, when the discovery was made by cabin crew.
In response, Air India dismissed the “suspicious object” found on the upper deck of business class as a “plastic wrapper”, and also denied the plane was a stand by aircraft for the PM.
But late evening, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju confirmed the discovery of the empty stun grenade, calling the incident a “serious security failure”.
The government suspended four AI employees, including security managers at Mumbai and Hyderabad airports, and appointed a high-level inquiry committee chaired by AI’s joint managing director Nasir Ali. Ground-handling officers and security supervisors could also face strict action.
The NSG has said it will probe the matter. “We have ordered an inquiry to see how even an empty casing of a stun grenade, which was without any explosive material, was left behind,” said a senior NSG official. The Special Protection Group, responsible for the PM’s security, will also look into the incident.
No actual weapons or explosives are used in such drills, a senior security official said. In fact, the NSG — the country’s elite anti-hijacking and anti-terror commando force — gives a certificate to AI saying no live ammunition will be used.
The 747’s crew noticed the grenade as it rolled out from beneath one of the seats.
The pilots informed Jeddah air traffic control and the plane was moved to a remote bay for checks. “Had it come to light when the plane was airborne, it would have led to force-landing, resulting in a mid-air scare,” said a security source.
The grenade carried the marking ‘anti-riot stun grenade’ and was produced at the BSF’s Tekanpur-based Tear Smoke Unit.
In Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh, the civil aviation minister said, “Corrective measures must be taken. The incident must not be repeated.”

Bihar stampede
(A large number of wailing…)
PATNA: With one more person succumbing to injuries, the toll in the stampede outside the sprawling Gandhi Maidan here after Dussehra celebrations has climbed to 33.
Principal Secretary Home Amir Subhani told PTI that one more person died today, taking the toll to 33.
Twenty-nine others were injured of whom the condition of four patients was stated to be critical, Subhani said.
Of the 29 injured admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), 17 are women and 12 are men, he said.
Subhani, who along with Additional Director General of Police (Headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey has been appointed to inquire into the stampede incident, said he would begin the probe with a visit to the spot at Gandhi Maidan at noon.
A large number of wailing people sat outside the PMCH the entire night looking for their near and dear ones who got separated in the melee.
Additional police force has been deployed at the incident site near Ramgulam Chowk.
The tragedy struck at around 7 PM yesterday at the South East corner of the ground near the Exhibition road when the people who were were returning after watching the "Ravana Vadh" (killing of demon king) event jostled with each other to move ahead, eyewitnesses and officials said.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered to watch the annual event at the historic Gandhi Maidan where several pockets were reportedly dimly lit when the stampede broke out.
Opposition BJP has criticised the Jitan Ram Manjhi government for the "lapses" that resulted in the tragedy.

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
PUNE: With the monsoon having withdrawn from most parts of India and on the way out from some, the Met office has said that rainfall this season has been 88% of the long period average (LPA) or 50-year average.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in its final weekly report, the country's LPA was expected to be 87% (+ or - 4%) for 2014. India's rainfall for July and August was 90% and 91% of the LPA as against the predicted 93% and 96% (+ or - 9%).
Meanwhile, central India, which includes Maharashtra, and south peninsula are the two regions with least rainfall deficit in the country. Central India has ended up with a 10% deficit, while south peninsula has 7% rainfall deficiency as compared to normal. Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab and West Uttar Pradesh received deficient rainfall by more the 50% of the LPA, the report said.
For the entire country, cumulative rainfall this monsoon has been 12% below the LPA. Of the 36 meteorological subdivisions, rainfall has been surplus over one, which is south interior Karnataka, normal over 23 subdivisions and deficient over 12 subdivisions. The report said that 3% area of the country received excess rainfall, 67% normal and 30 % deficient rainfall during the monsoon.
Maharashtra as a whole has ended up with a rain deficit of 14%, while central Maharashtra shows a 7% deficit, while Marathwada reels under 42% deficit this monsoon, the IMD said.
As per the Met office's analysis, rainfall for the country during July and August was 90% and 91% of the LPA. As for the four regions of the country, in northwest India, rainfall this year was 79% of the LPA, while the met office had in its long range forecast predicted 85% (+ or - 8%) for this region. Similarly, as against the met office's forecast of rainfall in central India being 94% (+ or - 8%) of the LPA this year, it was actually 90% of the average.
In south peninsula, rainfall has been 93% of the LPA, in agreement with met department's long range forecast. East and northeast India received rainfall which was 88% of the average as against met officials' prediction of 99% (+ or - 8%), the IMD said.
The southwest monsoon, meanwhile, has withdrawn from Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan, most parts of West Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and some parts of Jammu, Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh , East Uttar Pradesh, West Madhya Pradesh and north Arabian Sea. The withdrawal line of southwest monsoon continues to pass through Jammu, Una, Bareilly, Kanpur, Nowgong, Ujjain, Vadodara, Porbandar, among others.
The Met office has forecast that conditions are favourable for further withdrawal of southwest monsoon from the remaining parts of northwest India and some more parts of central India during the next two to three days.
Southwest monsoon may start withdrawing from parts of Maharashtra during the second week of October, said a senior IMD official. However, the monsoon normally withdraws from the state in the first week of October.

PM Narendra Modi slams Congress, seeks clear mandate for Haryana's development

Congress
(Attacking the ruling Congress…)
KARNAL (HARYANA): Continuing his Lok Sabha plank of ousting the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today sought a clear mandate for the BJP in Haryana for putting the state on a growth trajectory.
Kicking off his party's poll campaign in Haryana, he hit out at the Congress for the state's backwardness.
Modi said that today the entire world was looking at India with greater respect and this had happened not because of him, but the power of 125 crore people of India, who had formed a strong and stable government at the Centre.
"Why has India's pride increased today? It is not because of Modi, it is because 125 crore people of India have formed a stable and strong government in Delhi. This is your magic not Modi's magic. Do you want that Haryana's name also echo around the world."
"Its first condition is that there should be 'Congress mukt Haryana'. The second that a stable government with full majority should be formed. And third, there should be a government which lets Modi work in Haryana," he said.
Attacking the ruling Congress in the state, Modi said that those who could not do anything for the last 60 years were now asking for his record in 60 days.
"The people who could not do anything in 60 years, they are asking for my 60 day record," he said.
In his 30-minute address at a rally here, Modi, while describing the ruling Congress as "anti-farmer", was also critical of the party's claim that Haryana was No 1 State.
He said the state lagged behind in several parameters including literacy rate, per capita income, poverty alleviation, health, education, among others.
Modi also launched a veiled attack on main opposition INLD, asking the people whether they would like the State being governed from jail.
INLD President and former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala has been sentenced in the teachers recruitment scam.
Chautala, who is out on bail on health grounds, had said that he would take oath as the next CM from Tihar Jail.
Seeking to connect with the farmers of the state, Modi hit out at the Congress for stating that the Centre had imposed ban on Basmati rice export.
"I am surprised that is it necessary to speak lies in polls. I do not need to tell, but you know all my farmer brother and sisters are being misled, you are being told that Centre has imposed a ban on Basmati rice export, which is 100 per cent lies and injustice to the farmers," he said.
Modi said Haryana was levying four per cent tax which was fetching lesser price for Basmati growers.
Launching a scathing attack on the Congress over alleged land scams, Modi said thousands of acres of land had vanished and farmers were deprived of adequate compensation.
"Who has taken these lands, I want to ask you did you get compensation for your land. Where has the thousands of acres of land have gone, who has taken it," he said.
"Who is anti-farmer, you have to decide. We have to change this, for this I want a clear mandate in Haryana, make our candidates victorious...,"
 
At the outset, Modi sought to strike an emotional chord with the people, saying he had come to Haryana to campaign, a day after the Vijay Dashmi festival was celebrated.
He said Haryana was the land of "Daanveer Karan", the land on which the Mahabharata battle was fought and holy Gita's message was delivered.
"This election will decide Haryana's future. I am sitting in your neighbourhood (Delhi)," Modi said.
Recalling the days he used to work in the State as a partyman, Modi said he wanted to repay the debt as he had received love and affection from the people here.
He told the people if they wanted employment, overall progress, development in villages, in cities, then change in Haryana was necessary.
"Do you want that I should serve you, I want your blessings for that and government with absolute majority, give me an opportunity to undertake development," he said.
Talking about the new route for Kailash Mansarovar yatra, he said the route existed even when Congress was in power but they had failed to do anything.
"Kailash Mansarovar was there when Congress government was there. But going there was very difficult. The work which Congress could not do, we did it in such a short time....we managed to make China understand and opened a second road to visit Kailash Mansoravar. And now one can visit Kailash Mansarovar by road," he said.
Modi also touched upon a number of schemes initiated by the Centre including Jan Dhan scheme.
Elections to the 90-member Haryana Assembly will be held on October 15.
Haryana is set to witness a multi-corner contest with key players Congress, BJP, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP), BSP, Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC)-Jan Chetna Manch (JCM) alliance all set to cross swords.
In the last Assembly elections, Congress had won 40 seats, INLD 31, BJP 4, HJC-BL 6, SAD and BSP one each and seven seats had gone to Independents.

Modi kicks off Haryana campaign with sharp attack on CongressComments
Five months after a highly successful Lok Sabha election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is back to doing what he does best — working the crowds, wooing them with his one-liners and boundless energy. His request: absolute majority for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana.

Kicking off his campaign for the October 15 assembly polls on Saturday, Modi slipped easily into his role of champion vote-seeker at his first rally of the day — in the northern state’s Karnal district. Accusing the ruling Congress and opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) of neglecting farmers and promoting goondaism, he appealed to voters to give the BJP a chance.
Alleging irregularities in land allotment, he asked, “Who among the poor has got a plot? ...But where have thousands of acres of land disappeared, who has taken this? Does Haryana want to settle the account?”
In a veiled attack on the INLD, he asked the people if they would like to be governed from jail. INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, serving a jail sentence in a corruption case but currently out on bail, had said he’d take oath as CM from Tihar.

Promising development and jobs, he hinted that Karnal may be part of his 100 smart cities project. And carrying forward his Swachh Bharat mission, he said, “We may be living in the age of Hi-Fi and Wi-Fi but safai (cleanliness) is equally important.”
Ending the day in Mumbai, he told a crowd at the Mahalaxmi Race Course, “Mumbai and Maharashtra’s growth is important for the country’s growth. I can’t leave Mumbai helpless any longer. The city is the birthplace of the BJP, which has achieved so much in such a short time.”
Attacking the ruling Congress and its ally, the NCP, but choosing to ignore former ally Shiv Sena, Modi said, “Amitabh Bachchan hosts a TV show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, but these Congress and NCP leaders have been playing Kaun Banega Arabpati all these years. Did 15 years of Congress-NCP government do any good to you, to farmers, to the poor?”
Watch: Modi, sounds poll bugle, tells Haryana voters to oust Congress
“Believe me, I can change Mumbai and Maharashtra. This is the city where most terrorist attacks happened, where most communal riots happened. Who is responsible? Do you not want to get rid of this?”
Earlier, in Beed and Aurangabad in drought-affected central Maharashtra, he appealed to voters to work towards a majority government of the BJP.
At each of his rallies, the PM also made it a point to recall his American trip, telling people, “I think small, but I think of doing big things for small people. Did India’s name ever reverberate in the US before? It did this time, not because of Modi but because of its 125 crore people.”
The audience, hanging on to Modi’s every word, didn’t have time for other speakers. Karnal MP Ashwini Kumar Chopra Minna had to leave his address mid-way after being booed. “I know you all have come to listen to Modiji, I can talk to you some other day,” he said.
Empty vessels make the most noise: Sonia Gandhi
Barely two hours after his Karnal speech, Sonia hit out at Modi at a rally in Meham, saying “empty vessels make the most noise”.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence,” she said.
"Has inflation come down? Is the poor man getting food at cheaper rate? Have the unemployed got jobs?" she asked.
Over the next 10 days Modi will be on a campaign blitzkrieg in the two poll-bound states, with over 10 rallies in Haryana and more than 20 in Maharashtra.
With no local face in these two states, the BJP is banking heavily on him for campaigning, especially since the party split with its allies, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Haryana Janhit Congress in Haryana.

Why Ben Bernanke  former US Fed chairman  cant refinance his mortgagePrint
New York Times | Washington | Posted: October 4, 2014 1:45 pm
An employee of a think tank owns a house in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood of Washington. He wants to refinance his mortgage, but the bank won’t give him a loan.
It is perhaps not the most shocking story in the world, but it becomes so when you learn that the think tank employee is Ben Bernanke, who was until earlier this year the chairman of the Federal Reserve, charged with setting the course of interest rate policy for the US economy.
And it seems downright absurd when you consider that he now makes a reported $250,000 for giving a speech and has signed a book contract that is surely in the seven figures. His income this next couple of years will surely dwarf the value of his house.
“Just between us,” he said on stage at a conference in Chicago on Thursday, according to Bloomberg News, “I recently tried to refinance my mortgage and I was unsuccessful in doing so.”
So what’s going on?
Anybody who knows how the world works may know that Ben Bernanke is as safe a credit risk as one could imagine. But he just changed jobs a few months ago. And in the thoroughly automated world of mortgage finance, having recently changed jobs makes you a steeper credit risk.
“The biggest issue that we see with changes in employment is when a change in pay structure occurs,” said Jim Woodworth of Quicken Loans. “For example, someone that goes from a salaried position to a commissioned position will encounter some obstacles with applying for a loan, even if the new job results in higher income.”
The more automated mortgages have become, the less room individual lenders have to use sensible judgment to conclude that, just maybe, the nice man with a beard who looks vaguely familiar and seems quite certain he will make plenty of money to make his mortgage payments might be a good credit risk, no matter what his employment status says.

INLD President and former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala has been sentenced in the teachers recruitment scam. Chautala, who is out on bail on health grounds, had said that he would take oath as the next CM from Tihar Jail.
Seeking to connect with the farmers of the state, Modi hit out at the Congress for stating that the Centre had imposed ban on Basmati rice export.
“I am surprised that is it necessary to speak lies in polls. I do not need to tell, but you know all my farmer brother and sisters are being misled, you are being told that Centre has imposed a ban on Basmati rice export, which is 100 per cent lies and injustice to the farmers,” he said.

Two police officers involved in probing the alleged hate speech by BJP president Amit Shah in Muzaffarnagar and filing the chargesheet against him have been transferred by the UP government.
The state police, however, maintained that the transfers of DSP (New Mandi Circle) Yogender Singh and sub-inspector Bharat Lal were part of a routine affair and had nothing to do with the case against Shah. A Muzaffarnagar court had rejected the chargesheet in the case, terming it “erroneous”.
“While Singh has been shifted to police lines from Circle of New Mandi, Lal has been transferred to Bhorakala Police Station from New Mandi Police Station,” SSP Hari Narayan Singh said.

Errant Taliban tweet claims spokesman in PakistanPrint
Associated Press | Kabul | Posted: October 4, 2014 1:13 pm
An apparently errant tweet by the Taliban’s spokesman in Afghanistan gave his location as being in neighbouring Pakistan.
Yesterday, a tweet by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claiming an attack included geolocation information that suggested he sent the message from Sindh, Pakistan.
Mujahid later sent a tweet today describing the location leak as an “enemy plot.” He also offered his Afghan telephone number to confirm his identity and wrote: “With full confidence, I can say that I am in my own country.”
Twitter says such geolocation data is based on latitude and longitude data or other information provided by users at the time of their message.
In an explanation of geolocation, Twitter itself warns: “Remember, once you post something online, it’s out there for others to see.”

Domestic M&A Rise 16.5% in January-SeptemberDr Reddy's Launches Docetaxel Injection in US
Mumbai: Mergers and acquisitions involving domestic companies jumped to the highest level since 2011 to $26.1 billion during the first nine months this year. They were up 16.5 per cent from the year-ago period.
During the first three quarters of 2011, the domestic M&A market stood at $34.5 billion, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters.
The average M&A deal size climbed to $75.2 million in the January-September period from $63.1 million a year ago as most deals were in the $500 million-plus range.
Out of this, domestic deals accounted for $11.1 billion, up 206.6 per cent over 2103, due to Sun Pharmaceutical's pending acquisition of Ranbaxy for $4.1 billion. The deal pushed the healthcare sector to capture 40.3 per cent of domestic deal activity.
However, total cross-board mergers and acquisitions plunged 40.2 per cent to $10.7 billion from the last year levels as both inbound and outbound activity declined. While inbound deals fell 24.6 per cent, outbound deals plummeted 70.2 per cent over the same period last year.
Total worth of completed deals amounted to $21.6 billion, up by 3.6 per cent to $22.4 billion in 2013.
Healthcare deals topped the deal street in market share with 23.2 per cent at $6.1 billion, an increase of 145.8 per cent from the first nine months of 2013, making it the highest since 2008 when it stood at $6.2 billion.
Energy and power sector followed next with 14.4 per cent of the deals at $3.7 billion, but down to 39.8 per cent from the same period last year.
The technology, media, and telecom sectors together managed a market share of 16.7 per cent at $4.3 billion from the first nine months of 2013 - an increase of 35 per cent.

Some investors aren’t just changing their passwords to avoid hackers. They’re embracing cyberattacks — and looking to profit from them.
Shares of cybersecurity firms, including VASCO Data Security (VDSI) , Fortinet (FTNT) and Red Hat (RHT) are attracting investors’ attention as it’s becoming more clear big companies will need to do more to secure their digital hatches. Shares of eight stocks in the security software industry — based on the very broad Russell 3000 index — are up an average of 15% this year.
The big winners Friday on the heels of the news of the latest breach against J.P. Morgan are Vasco, rising 8.1% to $20.26, Fortinet up 2.8% to $25.68 and Red Hat, up 1.9% to $58.47.
Cyberattacks are taking down the nation’s most venerable companies, including J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) , Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT) . Consumers are understandably concerned about what these attacks mean for their personal data privacy.
But investors are looking for opportunity, picking the right one can be tricky. There are eight major stocks to choose from in the security industry and investors are torn on which ones will win.
The biggest computer security player by far is Symantec (SYMC) , with a market value of $16 billion. Wall Street analysts are lukewarm on the stock, rating it a “hold” and setting an 18-month price target of $24.29, says S&P Capital IQ. That’s barely above the current price of $23.48. But New Constructs , a firm that rates stocks based on their projected future cash flows, rates the stock an “attractive.”
Meanwhile, VASCO continues to be one of the hottest security stocks going. Shares are up 162% this year and up 8% just today alone to $20.21 Friday. Analysts are bullish on the stock, rating it “outperform” and holding an 18-month price target of $22. But New Constructs ranks the stock “dangerous.”
The security stock the analysts are hottest on its FireEye. Analysts are forecasting the stock to gain 57% over the next 18 months. But it hasn’t panned out this year, as the stock as skidded 35%.
So, definitely change your passwords. But be sure to do your own due diligence on these computer security stocks.
Below are the 8 security software stocks in the Russell 3000 index:

Villages may go  Off the Grid  to solve powe...Dre
(Renewable energy, particularly…)
NEW DELHI: More than 25,000 villages, which have been waiting in vain for half a century and beyond for the government to provide them with electricity, could soon see light at the end of the tunnel as they go 'off the grid' using novel clean energy solutions. Rather than be dependent on utilities to plug them into the energy network, these villages will get electrified through so-called micro-grids that generate power for their needs. Such off-grid solutions have been successfully deployed in Ghana and Germany, making rural areas self-sufficient in power through the use of clean energy and have captured the imagination of the government and industry alike.
Renewable energy, particularly innovative solutions to India's energy problems, have the strong backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was high on the agenda during his recent US visit.
"To expand the availability of clean energy resources to more people, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi endorsed the proposal to launch Promoting Energy Access through Clean Energy (PEACE), a PACE initiative, to rapidly deploy innovative renewable energy solutions to those who currently lack access to energy," the foreign ministry said in a release last week. PACE or Partnering to Accelerate Entrepreneurship is a US programme. Out of 6 lakh villages in India, about 26,000, mostly in Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar, UP and Jharkhand, have no electricity at all.
Thousands of other villages have a connection that barely works or lights up the lamps for just an hour or two a day. Tata Power is working on a pilot project in Purnia in Bihar in collaboration with the MIT to install a micro grid with a capacity of 1 MW to power 200 households in the region.
"The project should be completed by December this year or January 2015 and the billing would be on a flat monthly rate—Rs 100-200—instead of metering," said Praveer Sinha, Tata Power Delhi Distribution's CEO and managing director. Off-grid solutions could refer to standalone appliances used in lighting, cooking and agriculture as well as those that power village-specific micro grids using one or a combination of renewable energy sources.
For a country that ranks lower than even much smaller African economies such as Libya, Gabon and Trinidad and Tobago in per-capita electricity consumption, according to the World Bank, off-grid solutions can cater to millions of homes without getting bogged down by the complications and inefficiencies of grid-connected electricity. "Ghana and Germany have now what are called 'power independent' villages, which have their own solar-powered micro grids and surplus storage systems.
There's a possibility to cover at least 25,000-30,000 villages in India in a similar manner," said Manoj Kumar Upadhyay, founder chairman and managing director of ACME Group, which is engaged in solar energy solutions. Coal, power and oil minister Piyush Goyal told ET recently about his plan to expand "off-grid solutions".
"On the second day of taking charge, I decided let's do off-grid solutions, particularly for far-flung areas," he said. "I do realise that itis going to be impossible to get grids reaching out all the way there. We'll have to look at some offgrid solutions, some local solutions," Goyal said. Five R&D centres are being set up on power storage, a critical component in implementing off-grid solutions.
Along with the Indian Institute of Technology-Jodhpur under the leadership of Anil Kakodkar, NTPC is conducting a project to set up solar-thermal combination plants, Goyal added. A halving of the cost of production and storage of solar energy over the last few years is also a reason for the increased focus on off-grid solutions, said experts, who peg this market at billions of dollars.
 
"It has been estimated that in India currently there are about 400 million people (about 80 million households) who do not have access to clean commercial energy," said Anish De, partner, infrastructure and government services, at KPMG.
"According to the World Resources Institute, decentralised renewable energy enterprises (DRE) offer an annual market opportunity of $2.04 billion while the solar home lighting (SHS) market is estimated to be $27.4 million a year." De also said the capital investment required for these solutions would be relatively lower than that for regular power projects and that a number of firms are focusing on the area.
The size of the opportunity is also drawing the interest of renewable energy companies such as Suzlon Energy, which are not yet active in the off-grid space. "Off-grid solution is one of the most promising methods of filling the demand-supply gap with distributed generation to supplement grid supply," said Chintan Shah, president, strategic business development at Suzlon.

Parekh panel seeks govt support for power pr...Deepak Parekh panel seeks government support to revive stranded power projects

Bank of India
(The committee said a shortage…)
NEW DELHI: A panel headed by Housing Development Finance Corporation chairman Deepak Parekh has suggested that the government help developers of stranded power projects, attract private investments in coal mining and allow large consumers to buy power directly from producers, as part of its recommendations on reviving investment in infrastructure.
According to the high-level committee, the power sector presents the most complex of all challenges facing the economy. It estimated that distribution companies make a loss of about Rs 1 on every unit of electricity supplied to consumers.
This leads to power cuts as they try to reduce losses.
"The committee believes that unless the market structure is changed by moving from monopoly supplies to competitive supplies of electricity, which is consistent with the prevailing industry structure in developed countries, the sector may continue to be unsustainable," the committee said. It also suggested viability-gap funding for private firms in distribution.
The committee was set up in 2010 by the then UPA government. It was initially headed by former central bank deputy governor Rakesh Mohan whom Parekh replaced in July 2012. The committee submitted an interim report in late 2012 and completed its latest report recently.
"In order to introduce healthy competition and to eliminate incumbent resistance from (staterun monopoly supplier) Coal India, the committee recommends setting up of a new public sector un dertaking to award and manage public-private-partnership concessions. The new company should be allocated mines which either have all the required clearances or are in advanced stage of getting such clearances," the report said.
The committee also recommended that the government transfer yet-to-be-explored mines of Coal India to the new company.
The committee said a shortage of coal has delayed a number of power-generation projects and this has led to defaults in debt servicing by developers.
The committee recommended constitution of a task force under the chairmanship of a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India with representatives from ministries of finance, power, coal and petroleum to suggest measures for restoring health of stranded power projects through suitable relief in debt service obligations.

Govt may relax norms for authorized defence ...Government may relax norms for authorized defence agents
By Rajat Pandit, TNN | 4 Oct, 2014, 11.47AM IST
The NDA government in 2001 had lifted the blanket ban on agents, which had been in force since 1987 after the infamous Bofors howitzer and HDW submarine scandals.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: After implementing nuanced blacklisting norms to replace the earlier indiscriminate ones, the Modi government is now working to overhaul the policy on the hiring of defence agents by foreign armament companies.
Sources say the defence ministry has already held one round of top-level discussions on the policy for "authorised Indian representatives or agents" and the role they can play in facilitating and smoothening arms deals in a legitimate manner.
Though the policy is yet to take a final concrete shape, the "dominant view" now emerging in the MoD is that it should junk its regulatory role over the agents imposed through stringent guidelines issued in 2001. "The regulatory business has met with poor success, and even proved counter-productive," said a source.
India is the world's largest arms importer, having spent Rs 83,458 crore in just the last three years in acquiring weapons from the US, Russia, France, Israel and others. Overall, India has inked arms deals worth well over $60 billion since the 1999 Kargil conflict . But there are just a handful of legalised defence agents on the rolls of MoD.
Conversely, hordes of shady middlemen -- sometimes in the garb of "consultants" -- lurk in the corridors of power to grease the official machinery and swing deals with hefty kickbacks to politicians, bureaucrats and military officers despite all the anti-graft provisions and "integrity pacts" in place.
The MoD hopes to encourage the registration of a greater number of legalised agents with the new policy, which will probably be ready by November-December. As opposed to the wheeling and dealing of middlemen, these agents can assist foreign armament companies in replying to arms tenders, trial evaluation of systems, price negotiations, enhancing the quality of after-sales service and in resolving performance and warranty issues.
"The thought process is that armament companies should be free to choose anyone they want to act as their agents, provided they are not blacklisted. It should also be left to the company to decide how much commission it wants to pay the agent," said the source.
"MoD will only set some ground rules. For instance, like whether or not agents can sit in CNC (contract negotiation committee) meetings. The policy, of course, will not eliminate middlemen...they will continue to be tracked and prosecuted," he added.
Interestingly, the NDA government in 2001 had lifted the blanket ban on agents, which had been in force since 1987 after the infamous Bofors howitzer and HDW submarine scandals. But this bid to inject some transparency did not really work since the stringent norms laid down for agents were considered unrealistic, with the government even declaring it would determine the scale of commission to be paid to them. Consequently, almost no one came forward to be registered as an agent.

Brussels: Facebook, the world's most popular social network, gained European Union clearance on Friday for its proposed $19 billion takeover of mobile messaging startup WhatsApp in a deal setting it against the telecoms industry.
The landmark deal is the largest in Facebook's 10-year history and will give it a strong foothold in the fast-growing mobile messaging market.
WhatsApp is poised to become a potentially powerful rival to companies such as Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telecom Italia with its plan to add free voice-call services for its 450 million customers later this year.
The landmark deal is the largest in Facebook's 10-year history and will give it a strong foothold in the fast-growing mobile messaging market.
#facebook #whatsapp #european union
The European Commission said the Facebook-WhatsApp deal would not hurt competition.
"We have carefully reviewed this proposed acquisition and come to the conclusion that it would not hamper competition in this dynamic and growing market. Consumers will continue to have a wide choice of consumer communications apps," European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
Reuters was the first to report on September 25 that the deal would be cleared unconditionally. US regulators nodded through the deal in April.
WhatsApp and its rivals such as KakaoTalk, China's WeChat and Viber have in recent years won over telecoms operators' customers with a free text messaging option, posing a serious threat to the sector's revenues from this business, which totaled about $120 billion last year, according to market researcher Ovum.

Mumbai, Oct 4:  
Maharashtra’s political scenario has undergone huge changes ahead of the Assembly elections, with many senior politicians switching loyalties and migrating to rival political parties in a bid to stay in power.
Prominent among them is former Maharashtra Navnirman Sena MLA Ram Kadam, who had defeated late Pramod Mahajan’s daughter Poonam Mahajan in Mumbai’s Ghatkopar (West) constituency in the 2009 Assembly polls. He has now joined the BJP, after being apparently denied a ticket by the MNS.
Kadam is now a BJP candidate from the Ghatkopar (West) constituency of Mumbai.
Vijaykumar Gavit too had joined the BJP after being expelled by the NCP and is now a candidate from Nandurbar constituency.
Gavit’s younger brother Sharad, who defeated Congress strongman Surupsinh Naik from Nawapur constituency as a Samajwadi Party candidate in 2009, has now joined NCP.
The BJP has also taken on board Anil Bonde (independent MLA from Morshi) and Manikra Kokate (Congress MLA from Sinnar).
Prakash Shendge and Sambhaji Pawar were BJP MLAs from Western Maharashtra. Miffed with their parties for inducting local Congress-NCP leaders into the BJP, they quit.
Shendge is now an NCP candidate, while Pawar has chosen Sena.
Similarly, Rajendra Gavit a probable Sena candidate from Shahada, filed his nomination on an NCP ticket on the last day of forms submission.
Former Mumbai Mayor Shubha Raul and former Thane mayor Anant Tare, both deserted Shiv Sena, and are now contesting on MNS and BJP tickets respectively against Sena candidates.

Hackers hit bank. Is your money safe anywhereOct 04, 2014 at 12:25pm IST
Hackers hit bank. Is your money safe anywhere?
42
1
New York: Hackers stole personal information from millions of JPMorgan Chase customers this summer, in one of the biggest breaches of a financial company.
The bank says only non-financial data was taken - names, addresses, telephone numbers and email. But that's still a lot of personal detail, and experts warn that customers need to be vigilant about identity theft in the next several months.
The theft - involving 76 million households and seven million small businesses - raises questions about the safety of personal information, especially at banks. What risks do people face? Will this keep happening? And can bank customers reduce the threat of identity or financial theft?
Hackers stole personal information from millions of JPMorgan Chase customers this summer, in one of the biggest breaches of a financial company.
#hackers #hacking #bank #jpmorgan chase
Q: How concerned should I be if the hackers didn't get Social Security numbers, bank account or credit card information?
A: We may not yet know the full scope of what the hackers were able to steal, says Eric Chiu, president of HyTrust, a cloud security company based in Mountain View, Ca. "They can sit on your network for months, siphoning off data before being detected," says Chiu. He says that customers' addresses and phone numbers could be used or sold to others who might combine that information with other stolen data. It could then be used to access accounts or even to open new accounts in the unwitting customers' names.
Even if the information isn't used for phishing schemes or direct fraud, it could be sold on the gray market to people who might want to send spam or sales pitches to bank customers. "There's a good market for that kind of data," says Adam Kujawa, head of malware intelligence at Malwarebytes, a San Jose, California company that makes security software.
Q: How close did the hackers get to stealing customers' money or more sensitive financial data?
A: We don't really know. The hackers may not have been looking to siphon funds, says Chiu, because "data is what's gold now." Other security experts say the bank's public statements suggest that its defenses were partly successful, because hackers weren't able to get other information.
Q: So is this a partial win for the bank?
A: It might be, says Mike Lloyd, chief technology officer at Sunnyvale, Ca.-based RedSeal Networks. But the bank shouldn't declare victory - cybersecurity is "a never-ending war" against new and evolving threats.
Q: What else could happen?
A: One concern is that this breach was a reconnaissance mission in preparation for a bigger hack, says Craig Carpenter, chief strategist at AccessData, a cybersecurity firm. "They don't have to crack the entire system tomorrow," he says. "They could have simply been mining for data, or looking to leave something behind that would allow them to get into (JPMorgan's servers) easier next time."
Q: What else should banks do to protect customer data?
A: The financial industry is already doing more than other industries, says Dwayne Melancon, chief technology officer for the cybersecurity firm Tripwire, in Portland, Oregon. Chase in particular is known for using advanced security technology, says Avivah Litan, an analyst with Gartner, a technology research firm based in Stamford, Connecticut. But she also says that most companies have trouble keeping up with constant threats, and one big vulnerability lies with employees. While businesses tend to spend more on defending against outside attacks, many hacks begin with a compromised employee account. Litan says companies must do more to screen workers and also train them in security precautions.
Q: Should I close my account at JPMorgan?
A: At this point, there's no indication that's necessary. Steve Weisman, a Boston attorney and author of several books and articles about identity theft, says "it won't do any good" because other banks may be equally vulnerable to hacking. "There's no place to run and hide. You should monitor your account regularly and don't trust any communications you receive."
Q: After big attacks against retail chains and now Chase, should we expect more breaches?
A: The size and scope of the breaches are going to get worse, not better. Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase are just the beginning, says Darren Hayes, a professor and expert in cybersecurity at Pace University in New York. It's safe to presume that hackers have been sitting inside these banks and business networks for months, even years, sometimes not doing anything. "Hackers these days are patient ... and are extremely effective at just gathering a lot of data over time."
Q: Is there any way to protect myself if they're this sophisticated?
A: Change your passwords regularly, don't click on links in suspicious emails (they could be phishing attempts by scammers), and regularly check online statements for any charges you don't recognize. Be wary of calls requesting personal information.
Q: How bad is the fallout so far?
A: The New York-based bank says there's no evidence of financial fraud associated with the breach.

Why Ben Bernanke  former US Fed chairman  cant refinance hismortgagePrint
New York Times | Washington | Posted: October 4, 2014 1:45 pm
An employee of a think tank owns a house in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood of Washington. He wants to refinance his mortgage, but the bank won’t give him a loan.
It is perhaps not the most shocking story in the world, but it becomes so when you learn that the think tank employee is Ben Bernanke, who was until earlier this year the chairman of the Federal Reserve, charged with setting the course of interest rate policy for the US economy.
And it seems downright absurd when you consider that he now makes a reported $250,000 for giving a speech and has signed a book contract that is surely in the seven figures. His income this next couple of years will surely dwarf the value of his house.
“Just between us,” he said on stage at a conference in Chicago on Thursday, according to Bloomberg News, “I recently tried to refinance my mortgage and I was unsuccessful in doing so.”
So what’s going on?
Anybody who knows how the world works may know that Ben Bernanke is as safe a credit risk as one could imagine. But he just changed jobs a few months ago. And in the thoroughly automated world of mortgage finance, having recently changed jobs makes you a steeper credit risk.
“The biggest issue that we see with changes in employment is when a change in pay structure occurs,” said Jim Woodworth of Quicken Loans. “For example, someone that goes from a salaried position to a commissioned position will encounter some obstacles with applying for a loan, even if the new job results in higher income.”
The more automated mortgages have become, the less room individual lenders have to use sensible judgment to conclude that, just maybe, the nice man with a beard who looks vaguely familiar and seems quite certain he will make plenty of money to make his mortgage payments might be a good credit risk, no matter what his employment status says.
 

At least 3 killed  11 injured in two blasts inPakistanPress Trust of India | Islamabad/karachi | Posted: October 4, 2014 1:38 pm
At least three persons were killed while 11 others got injured on Saturday in two different explosions in Khyber-Pakhtukhwa province in Pakistan’s northwest and Quetta, the capital of Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province.
In the first incident, explosive material was hidden in a bag placed in a vehicle parked in Peshawar Chowk of Kohat city. There passengers died and four others injured in the blast, Geo News quoted a police official as saying.
Meanwhile, in the other incident, at least seven persons were injured when another powerful explosion rocked Quetta, police said.
A police official said that the explosive was fitted with vehicle loaded with fruits.
“The vehicle was parked on the roadside at the time of bombing,” he said.
A senior police official was apparent target of the blast as the explosion occurred when his vehicle was near the site of bombing, the reports said. However the official remained unhurt.
Nobody took responsibility for the attacks but the Taliban and Baloch nationalist often targets the civilians and security forces in their respective areas.

Narendra Modi seeks Congress mukt Haryana  clear mandate for statesdevelopmentComments

Continuing his Lok Sabha plank of ousting the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday sought a clear mandate for the BJP in Haryana for putting the state on a growth trajectory.
Kicking off his party’s poll campaign in Haryana, he hit out at the Congress for the state’s backwardness.
Modi said that today the entire world was looking at India with greater respect and this had happened not because of him, but the power of 125 crore people of India, who had formed a strong and stable government at the Centre.
“Why has India’s pride increased today? It is not because of Modi, it is because 125 crore people of India have formed a stable and strong government in Delhi. This is your magic not Modi’s magic. Do you want that Haryana’s name also echo around the world.
“Its first condition is that there should be ‘Congress mukt Haryana’. The second that a stable government with full majority should be formed. And third, there should be a government which lets Modi work in Haryana,” he said.
Attacking the ruling Congress in the state, Modi said that those who could not do anything for the last 60 years were now asking for his record in 60 days.
“The people who could not do anything in 60 years, they are asking for my 60 day record,” he said.
In his 30-minute address at a rally here, Modi, while describing the ruling Congress as “anti-farmer”, was also critical of the party’s claim that Haryana was No 1 State. He said the state lagged behind in several parameters including literacy rate, per capita income, poverty alleviation, health, education, among others.
Modi also launched a veiled attack on main opposition INLD, asking the people whether they would like the State being governed from jail.

SI Bharat Lal had investigated the case while Dy SP Yogender Singh had filed the chargesheet in the court.
Shah was chargesheeted by the police on September 10 for his alleged hate speech during campaigning here for the Lok Sabha elections.
The court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Sunder Lal on September 11 refused to take cognisance of the chargesheet against BJP president Amit Shah in connection with the alleged hate speech made by him and returned it to the police.
Lal had refused to take cognisance of the charge sheet as police had not followed the provisions of 173[2] CrPc in which they did not try to arrest the accused before filing the charge sheet in court.
Returning the chargesheet to remove errors, the court had said police cannot file a chargesheet under Section 188 IPC as it should be filed as a private complaint by the officer concerned, who had imposed prohibitory orders which were violated.

Defused explosive found on Modi s stand-by jetAir India probes defused explosive aboard VVIP aircraft
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS –  Sat 4 Oct, 2014
Print
Mumbai, Oct 4 (IANS) Indian security agencies have launched an investigation into the discovery of a defused explosive on board an Air India VVIP special aircraft at Jeddah Airport early Saturday.
Confirming the development, Air India officials guardedly said here Saturday that "a probe is under way" to unravel how, where and when the major security breach occurred.
According to AI sources, the aircraft, a Boeing 747 was an emergency stand-by aircraft intended for use by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in case his regular aircraft developed any last minute snags.
The aircraft was kept in complete readiness at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, and released Friday for commercial operations after Modi's return to India.
After release from stand-by VVIP duty, it was operated as a scheduled domestic-cum-international sector Delhi-Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah flight.
The defused explosive was discovered early Saturday by security officials from the business class section of the aircraft after the flight landed at Jeddah.
AI officials remained tight-lipped whether the explosive was a grenade or a bomb, and why it was not found when the aircraft was flying on the domestic sector. They said the report of the investigations, ongoing at Jeddah Airport, is awaited.

Why Skyscrapers May Be  Damaging  This CityYou are here: Home Industries
Londoners Divided on Skyscraper Boom
Agence France Presse | Updated On: October 01, 2014 15:07 (IST)
Skyscrapers are shooting up all over London, transforming a skyline once dominated by Big Ben and St Paul's Cathedral.
Some Londoners are delighted at their city's "Manhattanisation" but others warn it risks losing its soul.
"The City of London was a place of intricate streets," a "precious" urban pattern inherited from Georgian times, said Kieran Long, curator in contemporary architecture at the Victoria and Albert Museum.
"You must be very careful with what you put there," he told AFP. "Some of the high buildings have done damage to that."
A new study has revealed that no fewer than 237 skyscrapers are being built or have permission to begin construction over the coming year across London.
"It's going to change the face of London probably greater than at any time in its history, really, apart from maybe when St Paul's Cathedral was built," said Peter Murray, head of New London Architecture, a design and planning think tank.
Finished in 1710, St Paul's stands 111.3 metres (365 feet) tall - around a third of The Shard, Europe's highest skyscraper, which towers over the once-gritty Southwark neighbourhood.
Long warned places like the City of London and the West End were in danger of "losing" their character - a view not shared by passers-by at the foot of the "Walkie-Talkie", one of the signature towers changing the face of the British capital.
"I like them, I think they add character. They make London a bit more unusual," City worker Lucille Davis said.
Staring up at the skyscraper, Andy Arwood called it "amazing".
"There are so many buildings in London which are boring and dull and someone has actually sat down with that and designed it. I think it's brilliant!" he said.
'Changes the character'
London's skyscraper boom has come as a surprise to city authorities too, since there is no central urban planning office for the capital and decisions are taken borough by borough.
Mr Murray said the wave of construction was approved in response to major population growth in London with around 100,000 people coming in every year, which could bring the city's population to nearly 10 million by 2030 and around 13 million by 2050.
But while the architecture expert said some affordable housing is provided in the new buildings, he said the skyscrapers "are really designed for wealthier people".
"This is a total reversal to what we had in the 1960s and in the 1970s, where we built ugly concrete towers which were designed for poor people," he said.
In the new towers of glass, high-living apartments can go for tens of millions of pounds.
Billed as London's most luxurious apartment block, the 36-storey "Heron", for example, boasts a 6,000 square foot penthouse which went on the market this year for 18 million pounds ($30 million).
London's more original-looking skyscrapers have earned affectionate local nicknames like the "Walkie-Talkie", by Uruguay's Rafael Vinoly, or the curvaceous "Gherkin" by British architect Norman Foster.
One of the newest additions has been dubbed the "Cheesegrater" for its sloped profile, specifically designed to protect citywide views of St Paul's.
A frequent criticism of high-rises, in urban planning terms, is their thick base which Long said "completely changes the character of the streets".
By making local streets less hospitable, they can contribute to killing off independent shops, already few and far between in much of central London, in favour of sandwich joints for office workers, Long argued.
Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, the architects behind the "Cheesegrater", sought to respond to such concerns by cutting back the structure to create a sunlit plaza below.
But a letter to The Observer newspaper earlier this year signed by intellectuals including sculptor Antony Gormley and author Alan Bennett described many other towers as "generic" eyesores.
"The skyline of London is out of control," they warned. "Too many of these towers are of mediocre architectural quality and badly sited."

Movies Review: HaiderPrint
Film: "Haider"; Cast: Shahid Kapoor, Tabu, Kay Kay Menon, Shraddha Kapoor, Irrfan Khan; Director: Vishal Bhardwaj; Rating: *** 1/2)
With revenge as the underlying motive, "Haider" is a quintessential Vishal Bhardwaj film adapted from one of Shakespeare's most powerful and influential tragedies - "Hamlet". It's a tale of a son's quest for his missing father.
Set in Kashmir circa 1995 the film outlines the story of Haider (Shahid Kapoor) who returns to Kashmir from Aligarh, upon learning of his father, Hilaal Meer's disappearance. While pining for his father, he chances upon the romance brewing between his mother Ghazala (Tabu) and his father's brother Khurram (Kay Kay Menon).
When Haider sets out in search of his father, his childhood sweetheart, Ashi (Shraddha Kapoor) helps him. Through her, he meets Roohdar (Irrfan Khan) a Pakistani militant, who makes him believe that his father has been manipulatively murdered. That marks the beginning of the revenge saga.
The first half of the film is light-hearted and meanders aimlessly, but it is the lengthy second half that picks up the momentum and beautifully wraps up the film.
Overloaded with tense moments, the film has numerous dramatic interludes that are edgy and gripping. Vishal Bhardwaj astutely creates tension in the scene where Haider is watching Khurram dancing and singing for his mother and intermittently calling her "bhabhijaan".
On the performance front, the film belongs to Shahid, while Tabu and Kay Kay Menon provide ample support with their well-etched characters. Their powerful performances make "Haider" a delightful cinematic experience.
Shahid steals the show with his controlled and zealous rendering of Haider. His monologue at the town square with a transistor hanging from his waist is particularly worthy of a mention. Initially, it seems comical, but effectively encapsulates, not only his grief, but also brings out the antagonism of the local Kashmiris.
Similarly, Tabu's yearning for love and guilt-ridden behaviour are effectively expressed, proving her versatility. Kay Kay matches her intensity with his dramatic fervour.
Shraddha as the charming Ashi and Irrfan with his enigmatic getup and an obvious limp, have nothing much to offer by way of performances.
With Hindi, Urdu and the Kashmiri dialects, Bhardwaj creates a realistic backdrop for his characters. He also captures the strained and edgy political scenario of Kashmir with honesty. There is unintentional humour and poetry in the dialogues, which enhance the charm of the film.
The screenplay is well designed and the songs, as is always the case in Bhardwaj's films, are a treat. "Bismil, Bismil" and "Na shaam ya saveraa" are well choreographed and meshed beautifully into the otherwise grim plot.
Visually too, "Haider" is one of Bhardwaj's aesthetically framed films. Pankaj Kumar's cinematography highlights Kashmir in all its glory, displaying the beauty of the seasons. The atmospheric lighting adds to its visual appeal. The snow-filled frames are a delight to watch. But the jerky camera movements in some of the tense scenes are an aberration and mar the viewing experience.
Overall, "Haider" is a well made film complimented with dramatic performances, strong script and fine music. Don't miss this one.

Modi urges Indians to recognise their strengthsModi urges Indians to recognise their strengths

Emphasises useage of Khadi products to light the lamp of prosperity in a poor man’s house
New Delhi, Oct 3:  
This could be well beginning of reenergising ‘swadeshi’ movement in the country Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people to buy at least one ‘khadi’ cloth in their day-to-day life.
“If you buy khadi, you light the lamp of prosperity in the house of a poor person,” he said in his maiden radio address to the nation, ‘Man ki Baat’ on Friday. Khadi products comprises of most of products which any one need in his day-to-day life be it clothes, foot wares, food products including spices, cosmetics, herbal medicines and many more. Modi impress upon people to use use at least one Khadi product, may it be a handkerchief or even a bed sheet.
It will be a true homage to Mahatma Gandhi. As Khadi outlets provide special discount every year to mark the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, October 2, the Prime Minister called people to take advantage of this scheme which runs through for a month. Currently, there are over 7,000 khadi outlets all over the country besides various retail shops selling Khadi products. During 2013-14, Khadi & Village Industries produced goods worth over Rs 26,000 crore and provided employment to over 1.4 crore people.
Strength
Using the medium, which reaches to 99.2 per cent of population and covers 92.per cent of geographical area in the country, Modi gave a pep talk to shed despondency and use skills for betterment and prosperity of the country. “You know, our scientists have undertaken the Mars mission successfully at minimum expenses. There is nothing lacking in our capabilities. We only have forgotten our strengths. We have forgotten ourselves as if we have become despondents. My brothers and sisters, this cannot be,” he said in his little over 15 minutes broadcast.
“We need to recognise our internal strengths,” the Prime Minister said while narrating a short story of Swami Vivekananda about how a lion brought up by sheep rediscovered his prowess after coming in touch with another lion, he said while adding that if citizens move ahead with self-respect and right identity, we will emerge victorious.
Get up and walk
The Prime Minister said that he keeps laying emphasis on 125 crore citizens of the country because till now there has been a mindset that the government will do everything. “We have seen where we stand. If we have to move ahead, 125 crore Indians will have to act,” he said.
To press his point, Modi narrated another story regarding a person who sat on the wayside and kept asking several people the way to his destination, but was told the correct path only when he got up to walk. “Till we don’t decide to get up and walk, we won’t find guides to show us the way,” he added. While emphasising on greater participation of common people, the Prime Minister said the country belongs to not only the government but everyone.
Regular feature
The Prime Minister promised to be on radio twice in a month or even once at 11 am on Sundays. Explaining his decision to address the nation over radio, he said it is such a simple medium and through the broadcast he would be able to reach far and wide and the homes of the poor. “The strength of the country is in the huts of the poor, the strength of my country lies in villages, the strength of my country in mothers, sisters, youth and farmers. The country will progress on the basis of your strength, this I believe in. I have faith in your strength, so I believe in the future of India,” he said.

Avoid low-rated NCDs offering high interest: Expertsinvestors
(Experts are also uncomfortable…)
MUMBAI: Should investors put money in the non-convertible debentures of companies outside the top-rated ones? Some companies including Kosamattam Finance, Muthootu Mini Financiers and Muthoot Fincorp have launched NCDs that do not enjoy the best ratings and investors have been tempted to put money into them due to high interest rates and in the absence of fixed deposits by manufacturing companies.
But, wealth manwagers are advising caution while investing in these instruments.
NCDs of companies with ratings of AA and above are considered the safest. The three papers in the market now are below this, though they are above junk. For instance, the rating for Kosamattahm's NCD is BBB-, Muthoottu Mini is BB+ and Muthoot Fincorp is A. Investors are attracted to these NCDs because of the higher rates compared to bank deposits. For example, Kosamattam Finance pays 13% p.a and Muthoottu Mini Financiers pays 12.75% p.a.
These rates are a good 3-3.5% more than what banks pay for fixed deposits and about 1-1.25% higher than that offered by higher rated company such as SREI Infrastructure Finance (AA-). They have a tenure ranging from 400 days to 72 months and investors have the flexibility to receive interest monthly, yearly or at the end of the tenure.
Despite these high interest rates on offer, investment advisors ask investors to stick to quality and skip these low-rated issues. "Don't be carried away by the extra returns. Retail investors should stick to high-quality companies which command a good rating," says Harshvardhan Roongta, chief financial planner, Roongta Securities. He advises to skip all issues which have less than AA rating.
Many investors are tempted to lock money into such NCDs because they have been short of options.
Manufacturing companies have stopped raising money through fixed deposits after the new Companies Act came into force from April 2014 which requires them to rate their papers.
These companies are reluctant to do so. Typically, retired individuals looking to meet their monthly expenses through interest income and those in the lower tax brackets invest in these NCDs. Also, unlike bank accounts where interest income above Rs 10,000 attracts TDS, if you opt to hold these NCDs in demat form there is no TDS.
Experts are also uncomfortable with NCDs of companies which are unlisted. These issues are also small in size and, hence, suffer from poor liquidity. Due to their small-issue size, there is hardly any trading in them, and if the investor requires money before maturity he could be stuck or forced to sell them at a discount.

Amazon Chief Calls on PM Narendra ModiDr Reddy's Launches Docetaxel Injection in US
New Delhi: E-commerce major Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey P Bezos, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday.
"Jeffrey P. Bezos, President, Chairman and CEO of Amazon.com, called on the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi today," an official release said.
Mr Bezos have been visiting Indian cities this week. Amazon, the world's largest e-tailer, has already committed $2 billion investment in the country.
Earlier this week, he had said that Amazon is evaluating setting up a data centre in India to tap into the multi-billion cloud opportunity.
"We are always evaluating new locations. We have AWS (Amazon Web Services) . We started it long time ago and it has grown into a very large business, separate from our consumer business," Mr Bezos had said.
"We are building new data centres and are looking where we should put them and evaluating these in India as well," he had said.
For Amazon, which launched its marketplace in India last year, the country is one of its fastest growing markets and is on track to touch $1 billion in gross sales.
Mr Bezos had said the pace at which internet penetration was increasing in India was stunning and that was one of the tailwinds for the growth of e-commerce.
"India is unbelievably energising; the people are focused on learning and extremely inventive," he had said.

Forex Reserves Down $1.4 Billion at $314 Billion: RBIWhy Rupee Hit Nine-Month Low against Dollar
Mumbai: Falling for the fourth week in a row, India's foreign exchange reserves fell by $1.415 billion to $314.181 billion in the week to September 26 on account of a hefty drop in non-US currency assets.
In the previous week, the reserves had fallen by $101.3 million to $315.596 billion. During the week to July 25, the reserves had touched $320.56 billion, a shade away from the life-time high of $320.79 billion recorded on September 2, 2011.
During the reporting week, the foreign currency assets (FCAs), a major constituent of overall reserves, dropped by $1.391 billion to $287.392 billion, data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed.
FCAs, expressed in dollar terms, include the effect of appreciation/depreciation of the non-US currencies such as the euro, pound and yen held in reserves.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has described the fall in reserves as a dip in valuation with appreciation of dollar against other currencies.
"In the recent weeks the dollar has been appreciating against the other currencies. Therefore, when we look at our reserves in dollar terms, they have been coming down," Mr Rajan had said on the monetary policy review on Tuesday.
He added that the fall in the forex kitty was not due to the apex bank selling the greenback.
Gold reserves remained unchanged at $20.933 billion in the week under review.
Special drawing rights were down $17.4 million at $4.307 billion while the country's reserve position with the IMF dipped by $6.2 million to $1.548 billion during the week, the data showed.

Heres Chinas latest warning to Hong Kongs Umbrella RevolutionThe Future of Hong Kong
October 3, 2014
An editorial published Wednesday in the People’s Daily, a mouthpiece for China’s Communist Party, told protesters in Hong Kong that they would face “unimaginable consequences” if their demonstrations continued. Quartz has translated that editorial and  analyzed its implications .
Now a new opinion piece  (link in Chinese), posted earlier today, shows that China is not done wagging a finger at the Umbrella Revolution. This time, it says that the protesters are “doomed to fail.”
Like the earlier message, the new piece criticizes protesters for “inciting illegal activity,” and challenging the authority of Beijing. It dismisses the protesters’ desire for universal suffrage and emphasizes adherence to the Aug 31 decision that only Communist Party-approved candidates will be allowed to run in Hong Kong’s 2017 elections.
Quartz has translated the full text of the latest editorial, included below.

Firmly uphold the National People’s Congress Standing Committee’s decision
People’s Daily editorial, October 3, 2014
For several days, many in Hong Kong have been striving for so-called “true universal suffrage,” all the while inciting illegal activity and causing trouble. Through street demonstrations, they have attempted to force the hand of central authorities to alter the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. Their approach openly violates Hong Kong Basic Law, the laws of Hong Kong itself, and the rule of law in general. It is doomed to fail.
The long-discussed election of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’s Chief Executive is of historic importance in the progress of Hong Kong’s democracy. Since the return to Chinese control in 1997, central authorities have supported Basic Law and continuously promoted the development of democracy in Hong Kong. At the end of 2007 the Standing Committee established a definitive timeline, deciding to allow general elections for Hong Kong’s chief executive by 2017. With this election in place, all members of the legislative council could be chosen through general elections. That is to say, the principle and system of general elections would be implemented well before the end of the 50-year period during which Hong Kong’s economy and legal system are to remain unchanged.
On August 31 of this year, the Standing Committee issued a decision clearly defining the principles and systems for the election of the Chief Executive. These amply demonstrate the unwavering and sincere commitment of central authorities to the implementation of general elections in Hong Kong.
This Standing Committee decision embodies the fundamental aims of “one country, two systems” and the provisions of the Basic Law. It has taken full consideration of all opinions related to the election of Hong Kong’s chief executive, and is consistent with the realities on the ground in Hong Kong. It is legal, fair, and reasonable. This decision will also clarify mistaken interpretations of Basic Law. By adhering to the provisions of Basic Law, and being built upon a common understanding of the law, it has contributed to the eventual realization of general elections in Hong Kong.
Today, some people ignore the “one country, two systems” policy and the existence of the Basic Law. They openly incite illegal protests, demand so-called “true universal suffrage,” and insist that their representatives—even if they have challenged central authorities—become candidates for chief executive of Hong Kong. Such demands are both unlawful and unreasonable.
Hong Kong is an administrative region of China, directly administered by the central authorities of the people’s government. It is neither a country nor an independent political entity. Seventeen years after the handover of Hong Kong to China, some still lack a full understanding of “one country, two systems.” They do not comply with the Basic Law of Hong Kong, and disapprove of the central authorities’ governance.
If we let this minority drive public opinion, “one country, two systems” will not be carried out properly. This would harm Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability, as well as the prospect for the smooth implementation of general elections. From a legal perspective, if election of the chief executive has not yet obtained approval from the legislative council, only the current system of selecting for that position will be applicable. On matters of such importance there is no room for debate.
The illegal demands and political slogans put forward by a small group in Hong Kong show that they disregard the rule of law and use illegal means to disrupt social order. The goal of so-called “true universal suffrage” is a challenge both to the country’s highest authorities and to the democratic rights of the people of Hong Kong. In the end the only thing it will harm is these people’s desire for such democratic rights. These illegal efforts do not have popular support, and in the end they will fail.
We must look further down the road. The path toward universal suffrage begins with the Basic Law of Hong Kong and the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. This is the correct and only direct path. The legal authority of the Standing Committee cannot be challenged. Supporting its decision is the inevitable choice. Indeed, it is the only choice.

Mkts may consolidate in near term; IT  auto likely to do wellBirla Sun Life Mutual Fund
(In the near-term, the market…)
Information technology (IT) and automobile shares are expected to do well, while the broader market could consolidate going forward, according to Mahesh Patil , chief investment officer, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund . In an interview with ET's Nishanth Vasudevan, Patil said investors should avoid sectors linked to global commodities. Edited excerpts:
What is your outlook for the market for the rest of the year? There is concern that valuations are stretched after the rally so far this year.
In the near-term, the market could consolidate after the good run and can even see some minor correction on the back of global cues. The global risk can emanate from geo-political concerns such as from Iraq or from the US Fed's comments on likely timing of increase in interest rates. On the domestic front, the large PSU disinvestment and fund-raising pipeline of corporate India will increase the supply of equity paper, which can suck out liquidity. However, we remain structurally positive on the equity market. Macro-economic indicators like inflation, current account deficit, GDP growth are all showing signs of improving. The year-till-date outperformance of the market has led to rerating for market valuations, which are currently slightly above the long-term average. Usually, at the inflexion point in an economy, the markets tend to move ahead of fundamentals and may look a bit expensive. We believe that corporate earnings growth over the next 3-4 years can compound at 18% every year, which will normalise the expansion seen in market multiples. So even with slightly elevated valuations, equity markets can deliver handsome returns over next few years.
The Fed appears to be on track to raise rates by mid-2015. How will Indian markets react? Will the rupee weaken once Fed signals further monetary tightening?
Historically, interest rate increases when coming out of a downturn and accommodative monetary policy signals confidence in economic recovery. This coincides with equity markets performing quite well as economic growth leads to higher earnings. There could be bouts of volatility around the time of the first rate increase by Fed. However, over the next few months, the market will take this in its stride and will be driven by the underlying fundamentals. India looks favourable compared to most other large global markets. Similar principle would apply to the rupee also. There is a possibility of volatility around the time of rate hikes and then there would be stabilisation over the next few months. India is in a much favourable situation today compared to a year ago with current account deficit estimated to be below 2% and forex reserves at more than nine months of imports. The rupee should most likely remain around 60 within a small range.
Is it time to go back to exporters — technology and pharma?
IT and pharma, apart from being export-oriented sectors, are also defensive in nature with steady growth visibility. In absolute terms, we expect these sectors to give 15% to 20% return over a one-year period. In the IT sector, SMAC (social, mobility, analytics & cloud) technology is driving a digital revolution across industries and enterprise clients are resuming discretionary spend to future-proof their businesses. Improving client demand, stemming from cycliIT and pharma, apart from being export-oriented sectors, are also defensive in nature with steady growth visibility. In absolute terms, we expect these sectors to give 15% to 20% return over a one-year period. In the IT sector, SMAC (social, mobility, analytics & cloud) technology is driving a digital revolution across industries and enterprise clients are resuming discretionary spend to future-proof their businesses. Improving client demand, stemming from cyclical recovery in key geographies and rising discretionary spend, is driving our optimism in the IT sector. In pharma also, we continue to remain positive as the US generic exports segment provides a large opportunity for Indian pharma companies to leverage their cost competitiveness. Also, a strong product-filing pipeline from Indian pharma companies continues to provide growth visibility.
Which sectors do you expect to outperform over the next 3-6 months? Why?
We expect the IT and auto sectors to do well in the next few months. The IT sector's valuations for most large companies is still below the market multiples and with improving outlook and some more upgrades likely in the space, it is expected to outperform. The auto sector is an early play on domestic recovery. The auto demand is on an improving trend with most segments registering double-digit year-on-year growth in the last few months. Our discussions with dealers suggest consumer interest is back and most are expecting strong retail sales in the festive season.
Many mid- and small-caps are trading at astounding valuations. Is it a good time to book profits?
At current prices, mid-cap valuations are almost in line with the large caps. In the past, mid-caps have traded at about 10 to 15% discount to large caps. Given the valuations, midcaps may underperform large caps in the near term. However, in the past, we have observed that in a rising economic growth environment and improved liquidity, mid-cap earnings tend to grow faster than large caps'. Hence, despite higher valuations, good quality mid-caps with decent growth outlook would still outperform the broader market over the next few years.
Which sectors should investors avoid?
The global growth is still sluggish. China, which has been the single-largest consumer of commodities, is also facing challenges to sustain growth at higher levels. With the dollar strengthening on the back of gradual withdrawal of QE by the US, commodities as a basket are looking weak. Hence, we would recommend avoiding sectors linked to global commodities in general.

Bilateral trade to hit $100 bn: Indian cos bank on Chinese moneyChinese lenders like ICBC, CDB gradually increasing India exposure

(Industrial and Commercial…)
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's net profit from India has more than doubled in two years through March 2014, albeit on a small base. The profit and assets of the world's largest bank in India are still tiny compared with the local majors, but the pace of the expansion highlights the increasing presence of Chinese banks here as they try to play a larger role in supporting Chinese business interests while also diversifying their own asset base.
For China, which has $3.2 trillion of foreign exchange reserves and wants to deploy that beyond US treasuries, lending to some of India's fund-starved sectors offers double benefits - returns will be higher, and since these funds are for buying Chinese machinery, it will also boost its own manufacturing sector. For Indian corporates, especially in infrastructure, cheap Chinese funds provide a lifeline at a time when local banks are reluctant to expand their already large exposure to the sector.
These banks led by ICBC are expanding globally, with China's increasing financial and political clout. ICBC chairman Jiang Jianqing's has expressed his intent to tripling the contribution of overseas earnings to 10% by 2016. It recently acquired a 60% stake in Johannesburg-based Standard Bank for about $765 million. The deal also gives it an option to acquire another 20% over a five-year period.
"The Chinese are sitting on huge reserves and they are looking at investing outside the country," said Ashvin Parekh, managing partner of Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services. In India, the focus of Chinese financiers has been infrastructure, a sector that heavily depends on the neighbouring country for cheap equipment. For ICBC, the leveraged balance ance sheets of companies or an economic slowdown that has just started showing signs of ebbing had not been hindrance to increasing its India presence. Its profit has risen to Rs 231.15 crore at the end of March 2014 from Rs 99.95 crore in March 2012.
The bank set up operations in the country in May 2011 and over three years, its assets have grown by nearly 75% to Rs 907.64 crore. All this at a time when large foreign banks in the country, such as Standard Chartered, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Deutsche Bank, were facing pressure on their profitability. ICBC didn't respond to a request for comment.
The bank has so far only one branch in India and its loan portfolio consists of corporate loans for long-term projects in infrastructure, including power. During his recent India visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping had referred to ICBC's participation in funding India's infrastructure requirement.
"They have a long-term strategy in sight. They identify sectors which can assists the China story, for instance power," said Parekh. "Apart from debt exposure, in future I can see them taking equity exposures in the country." India's power sector is a big buyer of Chinese equipment, and so is the local telecom industry. And, Anil Ambani-led Reliance Power and Reliance Communication were the first to tap cheap Chinese funds. In 2011, RCom took a Rs 6,000-crore ($1.33 billion at the time) loan from China Development Bank to finance purchase of electrical equipment from China.
 
The telecom company followed it up with a Rs 2,700 crore loan agreement with China Development Bank (CDB), for financing imports and domestic expenditure of telecom equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE. In 2012, Chinese state banks including ICBC, CDB and Export Import Bank of China lent around $1.18 billion to refinance RCom's foreign currency convertible bonds.
In the same year, Lanco Infratech, another Indian infrastructure company, entered into an agreement with CDB for $2 billion of debt for two power projects totaling 2,640 mw. Of the total, $600 million was contributed by CDB and the rest was syndicated from other Chinese banks and financial institutions. China is India's largest trading partner, with Sino-Indian trade totaling $65.86 billion in 2013-14, and at $22.41 billion in the first fiscal quarter through June 2014, according to a report by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
India and China are targeting $100 billion of annual bilateral trade. The trade is heavily tilted towards China, and the huge trade deficit that India has with the neighbour is unlikely to narrow much in the near future. This means China's exports to India are set to increase substantially and so is the exposure of Chinese banks to the Indian economy. Recent agreements also indicate the possibility of that. Beijing and New Delhi signed deals worth $3.43 billion during President Xi's India visit last month.

I am not hungry for power  says Uddhav ThackerayComments
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who is not hiding his ambition to become chief minister of Maharashtra, in an interview to Hindustan Times, said he is not hungry for power, but wants his party to win in order to implement his vision for the state.
BJP leader and Union minister Nitin Gadkari said the BJP and Shiv Sena may come together after the polls. What is your response to that?
Gadkari’s statement is a ploy to create confusion among the voters. If they really have the intention to come together, then why did they break the alliance in the first place? Let them tell the people why they walked out of the alliance. Let the BJP also declare that it will not split Maharashtra. After that, we will consider their offer.
There is lot of bitterness between the Sena and the BJP. Could this have been avoided?
Who brought the bitterness in the relationship? They [BJP] broke the alliance, not me. There are rumours doing the rounds that the BJP will go with the NCP. All this is not very encouraging [for the prospect of a reunion].
So you see a realignment after polls? Who will you go with if you need a post-poll ally?
I am fighting this election with all my might and confidence, which will surely pay off. We will win power on our own. People should understand that coalition politics has damaged the state and they should hand over power to the Shiv Sena if they want Maharashtra to succeed.
You are the first Sena chief to openly declare he would like to be the chief minister. It also led to a stand-off between you and the BJP.
The BJP has been saying that they broke the alliance because of my ambition to become chief minister. They should have a look at the surveys that have come out and see that the people have voted in our favour. The results have made me more determined to do whatever it takes to fulfil their dreams and lead the Sena from the front. This is not my personal dream; I am doing it for the future of Maharashtra.
What is your pitch to the people of Maharashtra?
I have a vision for Maharashtra and I want to implement it. My plans are not only on paper. Whether it is a school education tab or telemedicine conferencing, I have shown the people how our ideas will look. No one has done that.
The BJP is bringing in PM Narendra Modi to campaign in Maharashtra. Will that make a difference?
In this election, people want a face to represent Maharashtra. Modi’s face cannot work in the state. People are irritated with the BJP because they broke the alliance. They trust the Sena and their love for Balasaheb Thackeray is unmatched. They think the BJP used the Sena to win the election and dumped us after winning power. Also the BJP’s campaign, based on the same government at the Centre and the state, won’t work. We have had the same party at both places for the past 10 years and we saw what happened. They only made money.
But you are still with the BJP in the Modi government?
This issue is very complicated and is not restricted to whether our minister should resign or stay in the government. When the elections took place, Sena and our voters also contributed to the NDA’s victory. Are you going to undo that? We need to have a discussion on that. They need to explain why they took our help during the Lok Sabha election and then dumped us.
Is the Shiv Sena banking on the Marathi vs Gujarati whisper campaign that is going on?
Many Gujaratis are unhappy with this and they have approached me saying it has deeply disturbed them. They feel that when it comes to Mumbai and Maharashtra, there is no alternative to the Shiv Sena.
BJP leaders criticised the Sena for sending your son Aaditya for seat-sharing talks.
I had sent Aaditya along with other leaders as my representative to indicate that seat sharing was a serious issue for me. They want the youth to vote for them, but they don’t want to see a young leader as my representative. If this is how they treat them, then young people in the state should seriously think about whether they should vote for the BJP.

Patna stampede death toll rises to 33  most died of suffocationPatna stampede death toll rises to 33, most died of suffocation
Patna , Hindustan Times  HT Correspondent, October 04, 2014

With one more person succumbing to injuries on Saturday, the toll in the stampede outside Patna's Gandhi Maidan after Dussehra celebrations has climbed to 33.

Twenty one others who were injured were undergoing treatment at the Patna Medical College Hospital , and they were all out of danger, hospital superintendent Lakindra Prasad said.
Prasad said the post mortem examination of the victims' bodies had identified asphyxia as the main cause of the deaths.
Principal Secretary, Home, Amir Subhani and additional director general of police (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey have been appointed to inquire into the stampede.
A large number of wailing people sat outside the PMCH the entire night looking for their near and dear ones who got separated in the melee.
Additional police forces have been deployed at the incident site near Ramgulam Chowk.
The tragedy struck at around 7 pm on Dussehra day at the south east corner of the ground near the Exhibition Road when people who were returning after watching the "Ravana Vadh" (killing of demon king) event jostled with each other to move ahead, eyewitnesses and officials said.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered to watch the annual event at the historic Gandhi Maidan where several pockets were reportedly dimly lit when the stampede broke out.
Eyewitnesses claimed the stampede was triggered by rumours that some people had come in contact with a live wire.
In the ensuing panic, slippers and shoes were seen strewn on a 500-metre-stretch as people tried to flee from the scene. "There was such a rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over," Verma said.
Locals also blamed the absence of any lighting at the venue for the accident. "No preparation was in place to account for the mass exit by thousands of people from a single gate in darkness at the same time," said a man present at the spot.
Angry spectators raised slogans against the administration for allegedly closing an exit near the western side of the venue for VIP movement. The Maidan has four exits but only two were used on Friday, they claimed.
The state government also announced ex-gratia of Rs. 3 lakh each for the next of kin of the dead. A high level probe has been ordered, said home secretary Amir Subhani.
The Centre also announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased and a compensation of Rs. 50,000 for the critically injured.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences and spoke to the Bihar chief minister to enquire about the stampede.
"The stampede in Patna is deeply saddening. I spoke to the Bihar CM about the situation. My condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and prayers with the injured," he tweeted.
Congress President Sonia Gandhi also expressed "shock and grief" over the deaths and injuries. "Dismayed at the unfortunate incident, Gandhi expressed the hope that the injured are being adequately attended to and conveyed her condolences to the families of those who passed away," a Congress statement said.
Blame-game over tragedy
Meanwhile, Union ministers Ravishankar Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan are visiting Patna on Saturday to take stock of the situation.
The opposition BJP criticised the Jitan Ram Manjhi government for the "lapses" that resulted in the tragedy.
BJP leader CP Thakur, who visited the hospital, said: "Prima facie the stampede appears to be due to administrative lapses."
Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad, in a tweet, squarely blamed the state government for the administrative failure, leading to the stampede.
Second tragedy in two years
This is the second such tragedy in Patna in less than two years. During the Chhath festival in November 2012, 21 people had died in a similar stampede.
The Gandhi Maidan has a capacity to accommodate up to 4.5-5 lakh people. It is the same venue where a series of explosions took place during the Lok Sabha campaign event of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that left six dead.

Ebola outbreak running ahead of worlds response: UN officialEbola outbreak ‘running’ ahead of world’s response: UN official
PTI
Tweet
Reuters WHO members and health directors stand outside the Port Loko District Hospital in Sierra Leona on September 27, 2014, where the maternity ward has been converted into an isolation holding centre for people with suspected cases of the Ebola virus.
United Nations, Oct 4:  
Terming the spread of the Ebola virus an “unprecedented situation”, a top UN official said that despite best efforts, the outbreak is “running” ahead of the world’s response to curtail it and funding for the international response is also lagging.
Despite best efforts, “the (Ebola) virus is running faster than the international community,” World Food Programme (WFP) Regional Director Denise Brown said, adding concerted efforts to get the virus under control had not succeeded.
“(The virus) is way ahead of us”, she said.
Calling it an unprecedented situation, Brown urged the international community to take exceptional measures to collectively get in front of the virus and to stop it.
The head of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), Anthony Banbury, is in Sierra Leone on the second leg of his visit to the most affected countries, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters here yesterday.
Banbury is in West Africa to jumpstart UNMEER’s work.
After arriving at the mission’s headquarters in Accra, Ghana, earlier this week, he spent the past two days assessing the situation in Liberia.
Regarding the funding of the response, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that 26 per cent or just $256 million, of the total $988 million needed, has been received.
An additional $163 million has been pledged to activities in the plan that covers immediate humanitarian support to the region, particularly Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
The UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has so far committed $13.4 million to support food and health operations as well as the regional humanitarian air service.
WFP is delivering food, planes, helicopters, ships, and flying in aid workers but the virus is spreading exponentially, and the response must increase accordingly.
The agency is building two treatment centres in Monrovia which should be ready by the end of October with 400 beds. But several other components must align, the world body said.

Army salutes youths for support in flood rescue operationsPress Trust of India | Srinagar | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:04 pm
Army Saturday “saluted” the efforts put in by the youth of Kashmir Valley during the devastating floods and said if it were not for the young men, the force would not have been able to effectively accomplish the mission of rescuing people.
“Probably, it is my men on the ground who have actually seen how effective and how important the role of the youth was. Every second or third boat of mine went to the local volunteers. If it was not for these local youths, who had guided us to reach the places, I cannot say how we would have been able to accomplish the mission,” General Officer Commanding of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps Lt Gen Subrata Saha told reporters here.
“As far as the Army is concerned, it salutes the efforts put in by the youth, (both) with us and also by themselves. We are deeply conscious because we have seen it with our own eyes.
“My own officers and men have conveyed this to me at various forums at all places and they all had lots of tales to tell of the great, great efforts of the youth,” he said.
Lt Gen Saha said the people of the Valley deserve all the respect and admiration for what they did during the floods.
“On so many occasions, when boats reached (submerged) houses, the inhabitants of particular house said ‘no, not me, please go to the neighbour’s house, they need it more than I do’.
The people, the youth, they all have my respect and admiration for what they have done,” he said.
The Commander, while commenting on a controversy surrounding the portrayal of Army in a recent movie, said art must have its own place.
“Honestly, I do not have time to watch movies. As a matter of principle, art is an expression and it must have its own place,” he said.

Rajnath assures Centres help to Bihar as Patna stampede toll rises to 33; Lalu blames it on administrationPrint

Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 2:57 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 8:18 am
The Centre on Saturday assured all help to the Bihar government to deal with the stampede tragedy in Patna that has left 33 persons dead.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh telephoned Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on Saturday morning and promised all help.
“The Bihar Chief Minister apprised me of the latest developments,” Singh tweeted.
Singh assured Manjhi of all help from the Centre including medical assistance and asked him to provide medical treatment to the injured.
Soon after the stampede on Friday night, Singh had spoken to Manjhi.
RJD president Lalu Prasad on Saturday said the stampede outside Gandhi Maidan which left 33 dead appears to be a result of administrative “lapse” and expressed dismay over the administration’s inability to make foolproof arrangements despite several unpleasant incidents in the past at the grounds in the heart of the capital.
As many as 33 people were killed in the stampede outside the huge Gandhi Maidan in Patna after Dussehra celebrations last night.
The tragedy struck at around 7 PM on Friday at the South East corner of the ground near the Exhibition road when the people who were were returning after watching the “Ravana Vadh” (killing of demon king) jostled with each other to move ahead.
Among those killed in the stampede, 21 were women, 10 minors including seven girls and three men.

Hong Kong tense after protest clashes scrap talks...and
versions
HONG KONG (AP) — Bolstered by a massive rally overnight, Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists were defiant on the eighth day of protests Sunday in the face of attacks by opponents and government warnings to clear the business district streets they have occupied to press their demand for reforms.
"Democracy now! Democracy in Hong Kong!" thousands chanted as speakers from the movement seeking wider political reforms for this former British colony urged them to persist in their campaign. The rally lasted hours, with participants at times clapping and cheering as a stream of speakers and singers addressed them and performed popular songs.
"We are not seeking revolution. We just want democracy!" said Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old student leader. "We hope there will be no violence," he said. "It would be unfortunate if this movement ended with bloodshed and violence."
The night passed peacefully despite fears that police would act to clear out the protesters. The city's top leader, Chief Secretary Leung Chun-ying, appeared on television Saturday evening to once again urge everyone to go home, saying things needed to get back to normal by Monday. The protests are demanding Leung's resignation, but he has refused.
Standoffs between the protesters and their antagonists grew ugly Saturday, as the two sides traded insults and at times taunted police.
Although the mostly student-led protesters have stuck to their pledges of non-violence, holding up their arms to show peaceful resistance, some shouted abuse at people who gathered to challenge their occupation of a major street in the gritty, blue-collar Mong Kok district, which is home to many migrants from the Chinese mainland.
"Go back to the mainland," some shouted, cursing them in the local dialect of Cantonese.
Minor skirmishes broke out constantly, broken up by police or bystanders. Adding to the disorder, some residents dumped water from their apartments onto the people below.
The students accused police of failing to protect them from attacks Friday by mobs intent on driving them away, shouting "Black Police!" — a reference to their claim that the police had allied with "black societies," or criminal gangs, to clear out the protesters. The claim was vehemently denied by the government.
"There are many problems to be resolved in society, but the right way is through rational communication to seek common ground while holding back differences," Leung said in his address. "Not fighting on the streets, which makes things worse."
Police had earlier arrested 19 people after brawls injured at least 12, including six officers. Eight men were believed to have backgrounds linked to triads, or organized crime, said Senior Superintendent Patrick Kwok Pak-chung. Thet were facing charges of unlawful assembly, fighting in public and assault, Kwok said.
Cheung Tak-keung, the deputy police superintendent, said police were trying their best to maintain "buffer zones" between people of opposing views.
"The situation was not easy to handle. There were thousands of people," Cheung said, noting that many of those gathered were just onlookers who could get caught up in a "very high risk activity."
The confrontations led protest leaders to call off planned talks with the government. Students and other activists object to China's decision to require a committee of mostly pro-Beijing figures screen candidates for the city's first-ever election of its top leader in 2017. They are also demanding Leung's resignation.
With the talks suspended, the next steps were uncertain. Police have repeatedly urged everyone to clear the streets but have shown tolerance after the use of pepper spray and tear gas to disperse protesters last weekend just drew larger crowds.
The standoff in Mong Kok, across Victoria Harbor from the activists' main protest encampment, was tense with opponents at times chanting "Pack Up!" at the mostly youthful protesters. At least some of the opponents are residents fed up with blocked streets and related inconveniences.
The opponents of the demonstrations are using blue ribbons to signal their support for the mainland Chinese government, while the pro-democracy protesters are wearing yellow ribbons.
Some people on the "blue ribbon" side rallied in Kowloon's waterfront Tsim Sha Tsui. "Love Hong Kong" and "Support Police" they chanted, holding up flags and heart-shaped signs with the slogan, "Alliance in support of our police force."
"Now the students are trying to control the government," complained a man who gave only his first name, Jackie. "If there was a riot on Wall Street in America they wouldn't tolerate such troublemaking."
The Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the groups leading the protests that drew a peak crowd of tens of thousands of people earlier, said they saw no choice but to rescind their agreement to the talks Leung proposed. They demanded the government hold someone responsible for the scuffles.

Chicago billionaire Ken Griffin, who in July filed for divorce from his money-manager wife, said he doesn't want his children moved to New York and defended the prenuptial agreement that she is seeking to have invalidated.
Of the prenuptial agreement, Griffin said in filings made Thursday in Cook County Circuit Court said that Anne Dias Griffin "actively negotiated with the assistance of three distinguished law firms and that granted her tens of millions of dollars, making her financially secure for life from the moment she said 'I do.'"
Meanwhile, Dias Griffin also petitioned the court on Thursday for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction "to maintain the status quo."

In September, Dias Griffin asked the court to declare their prenuptial agreement invalid. She had said that Griffin, who founded and oversees hedge fund Citadel, didn't provide her with a copy of the premarital agreement until shortly before their July 19, 2003, wedding, and she was coerced into signing it three hours before their wedding rehearsal dinner. Dias Griffin, who is also seeking sole custody of the couple's three children with "reasonable visitation" for Griffin, had said the premarital agreement would deprive her of rights "potentially worth billions of dollars" and leave her an estate worth about 1 percent of Griffin's net worth. She wanted to move with the children to New York City, where she founded and was managing partner of hedge fund Aragon Global.

FII flows hit 7-mth low on US Fed rate hike jittersBSE
(FIIs have invested about…)
MUMBAI: The possibility of a rate increase by the US Federal Reserve is casting its shadow on the Indian equities market , with foreign inflows hitting a sevenmonth low on fears of capital outflow from emerging markets, including India. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have invested about $845 million in September, which is the lowest monthly flow since February this year, when they pumped in $228 million.
Foreign investors have been investing less here: in the past two months, average inflows were about $865 million, which is about one-third of its five-month (March-July) average flows of $2.3 billion. Foreign inflows so far this year has been $13.85 billion, the highest in the emerging market basket.
"Investors are getting a bit worried about the monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve.
People are anticipating more volatile markets, and here India cannot do anything about it," said Jim O Neill , former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management in a recent interview to ET.
The BSE Sensex also snapped its seven-month winning streak, as the index lost 0.1% in September, ending its longest run of monthly gains since January 2007. The index, which scaled to a record high of 27,354 points on September 8, has corrected 787 points, or 2.9%, from its highs in less than a month, which reflects its nervousness, say analysts.
"The government's decision to defer gas price hike and Supreme Court's verdict on cancellation of coal blocks gave FIIs reason to sell some stocks," said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India research at UBS Securities. Meanwhile, the BSE Sensex has risen 26% this year, again the most among top-10 global markets.
India's outperformance has also sparked concerns that its valuations might be somewhat stretched, given that the actual recovery in the economy and corporate earnings are still some time away. The index is trading at 16.5 times to its one-year forward estimated earnings, while China's Shanghai Composite Index's is trading at 9.9 times, Brazil's Ibovespa Index is trading at 11.8 times, and Russia's MICEX is at 5.1 times.
The US economic growth outlook continues to remain positive and it's a matter of time before the US Federal Reserve raises rates, but fund managers say that India is unlikely to see serious implications from this.
"India is now better prepared to face a possible interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, compared to the tapering of quantitative easing last year. I would like to say India should continue to focus on reforms and growth, and not get worried by what's happening in the US or elsewhere," said Jim O Neill, former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
The market reaction to a possible interest rate hike by the Fed is likely to be more calibrated this time rather than a knee-jerk one, as seen in May last year when the US central bank had announced tapering of quantitative easing.
Hence, any fall should be used as a buying opportunity as markets have always rebound from such events. "The sell-off by foreign investors in recent days in not a cause for concern as foreign flows so far this year have been a one-way street. There's nervousness among market participants with the US Federal Reserve preparing for an interest rate hike, but the S&P upgrade could not have come at a better time. India is now relatively better positioned to attract flows compared to other emerging markets," said Abhay Laijawala, managing director and head of research at Deutsche Equities India.
The slowdown of FII inflows and dollar's continued rise over emerging market currencies on bets for an early hike in US interest rates have also hurt the Indian rupee as it fell 2.1% in September, the most since August last year, when the currency fell 8.8%.

Interview: Steve McQueen‘Let Me Be Frank with You’, by Richard Ford
It has been a busy summer for McQueen; no wonder the garden needed some concentrated maintenance. The explosion of publicity that surrounded the release of his Oscar-winning masterpiece 12 Years a Slave last year, and the trail of critical plaudits that has followed it, have been life-changing experiences.
Except that McQueen’s life barely seems to have altered. If he has become a cultural superstar, you wouldn’t know it. There is a notable lack of interest in his presence here. He once told me that he chose to live in Amsterdam for its “human scale”, and the city’s residents are doing their bit to offer a corrective coolness to the geysers of acclaim which have come his way over the past year.
As if to prove the point, McQueen puts his hand up to try and order some drinks. He fails to catch the eyes of the waiting staff. I decide to help him, and the two of us wave away, drowning in anonymity, hoping that someone will notice. A good 60 seconds later, we finally succeed. I wonder to myself if that has ever happened to a current holder of the Academy Award for Best Picture before. The maître d’s of Los Angeles would rather be skewered for sushi than allow such a thing to occur in any of their establishments. “I thought my arm was going to break!” says McQueen cheerfully.
McQueen’s latest project, his first since 12 Years, is an entirely predictable change of register. It is a short film shot on Super 8mm, Ashes, which is on show at London’s Thomas Dane Gallery from October 14. While 12 Years played to a captivated global audience in its millions, Ashes belongs to the more rarefied province of the contemporary art gallery, in which McQueen made his name.

A still from McQueen’s new work, ‘Ashes’, about a young fisherman who was killed by drug dealers. The film uses footage shot in Grenada 12 years ago
The film shows a handsome young black man sitting, standing, preening on the bow of a boat. He shows off to the camera, laughing and striking poses. In front of him is the sea and the bluest of skies. The camera seems to love him, and he loves playing to it, and he finally pratfalls off the boat.
The film is a joyful paean to youth and innocence – until you listen carefully to the soundtrack, in which two men recount, in thick Caribbean patois, the plight of one of their friends, a fisherman named Ashes. He found a stash of drugs on a beach, they say, took it away, and was then hunted by a gang of men who wanted it back. The posse caught up with him and shot him dead as he tried to escape. The narrators’ voices are full of sadness. We know, no explanation required, that the carefree young man in the film is Ashes.
The juxtaposition of spoken word and image, pulling and pushing at different emotions in the spectator, is typical McQueen, complicating and subverting a seemingly straightforward narrative. The film, he explains, has something of the quality of a found object for him: the footage of Ashes was shot 12 years ago in Grenada, his father’s birthplace, while he was shooting for another film entirely, the installation diptych, Caribs’ Leap and Western Deep.
There he is on the edge of the boat, looking towards this endless horizon. He doesn’t know he will be dead in six years’ time . . .
“Ashes was a fisherman, this extremely striking, beautiful young man, with blond dreadlocks, very charismatic,” says McQueen. “And I just thought, ‘Let’s shoot him.’ He didn’t say very much, but he just had this aura about him. In other circumstances he would have been a rock star or a movie star. He had that quality about him. I just wanted to shoot him. I didn’t know why. The footage wasn’t necessary for the piece, so when we got back I just put it away.”
McQueen returned to Grenada eight years later and made inquiries about the young fisherman. Friends recounted the circumstances of his demise. “I was so shocked. I found out what happened and it was in some ways a completely classical story – the young man who finds the stash of drugs, the 21st-century equivalent of treasure, and then the pirates go after him and kill him. Now that doesn’t happen in Grenada, it’s very rare. I was struck by this deep sorrow [of the islanders] about his death.”
The film, he says, is about “life’s possibilities. There he is on the edge of the boat, looking towards this endless horizon. He doesn’t know he will be dead in six years’ time. No one knows.” Except, that is, for the spectator, watching the film with hindsight. Visitors can also pick up a poster from the film, with a transcript of the difficult-to-understand testimony of Ashes’ friends. “I liked the idea of people taking something away with them,” says McQueen.

McQueen on location filming ‘12 Years a Slave’
I ask him if it feels good to return to the more intimate milieu of the art gallery after the bombastics of Hollywood film-making. “I never left it,” he says immediately. “And last year I did a very big show at the Schaulager [Basel] which actually didn’t feel very intimate at all. But the intimacy in one’s mind, yes.” The best way to describe the relationship between the two means of expression, he says, in a comparison he has made before, is that “the movie is the novel, and art is poetry. Not a lot of people appreciate poetry, and it is the same with art. It is a more specialised form. That’s the difference.”
But the two impulses are forever “expanding and contracting” in his mind, he says. I ask if it is difficult to shift between genres. It is the rarest of things for a video artist to convert to Hollywood film-making. “Not at all. It is not as if I am jumping into different states of mind. It is all about finding what you want to say, and then how you want to say it.” Is that very clear to him straightaway? “Oh yes. But these things are incubating in my mind for a long time. I am in 2007 right now.” I look for a hint of a smile as he says this but he appears deadly serious.
Art is poetry. Not a lot of people appreciate poetry, and it is the same with art
McQueen, who turns 45 this week, is routinely described as a prickly man who doesn’t suffer fools gladly, but I wonder if that is confusing his seriousness and unrelenting intensity for a kind of social awkwardness. He gives every impression to me of enjoying the interview process, watchful and concentrated while he is listening to the question, like a batsman steadying himself during a bowler’s run-up. When Kirsty Young brought up the same subject in a recent edition of the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, asking why he was so unfairly portrayed, he replied simply: “I am a black man. I’m used to that. If I walk into a room people make a judgment. I don’t care.”
. . .
McQueen was born in west London in 1969, moving from the White City estate to the more comfortable suburban environment of Ealing when he was a small boy. Encouraged by his mother, he turned to art, studying at Chelsea College of Arts and Goldsmiths College, before moving to New York to take a film-making course at Tisch School of the Arts. He was frustrated there by the strictures of the teaching, saying he was unable “to throw the camera up in the air”.
Throughout his career he has shown an innate ability to temper the rhythms of film to startling effect. In 1992’s Exodus, his camera followed two men walking through Brick Lane market in east London carrying potted coconut palms, imbuing in the innocuous narrative an inexplicable sense of tension and poignancy. In 1997’s Deadpan, a reproduction of a scene from Buster Keaton’s Steamboat Bill, Jr, he turned comedic homage into something more sinister and dangerous. The work was one of the pieces that won him the Turner Prize in 1999.

Michael Fassbender and Rory Mullen in Hunger (2008)
By the time he came to direct his first feature film, Hunger, in 2008 – the same year that he was chosen to represent Britain in the Venice Biennale – he was able to mix stillness and movement to masterly effect, stamping his own style on to a very different form of film-making. The movie, recounting the hunger strike of the IRA prisoner Bobby Sands in 1981, was clustered around a remarkable central scene lasting 22 minutes, shot in two takes and heavy with dialogue, between Sands and a priest. “It was a cascade of language, an avalanche,” recalls McQueen. “Up to that point, violence has been exhausted, so this was language being exhausted. And then the third act is the hunger strike, which is another kind of limit.”
He makes it sound like music, I say. “I like the idea of composing a narrative from A to B, and thinking how you take a person on a particular journey. It’s all about composing. It’s not a waltz, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, it is a more difficult thing for the spectator, but after a while you trust the film-maker’s decision. That is the art.”
Hearing McQueen talk about his film-making like this reminds me that, speaking to him about Hunger five years ago, I made a joke that he was about to be swallowed up by Hollywood. McQueen said then that he had taken some meetings which he found to be strange affairs, and that while Hollywood was full of clever people, their only terms of reference seemed to be other movies, and as a result they “killed” original ideas.
It is all about finding what you want to say, then how you want to say it. These things are incubating in my mind for a long time. I am in 2007 right now
So how did he successfully pitch the idea of 12 Years, I ask him? How did he conquer Hollywood? “12 Years could not have been made anywhere else,” he replies. “It had to be made in Hollywood. I couldn’t raise the money in Europe. And I was extremely lucky that people trusted me and trusted my vision. Brad [Pitt, whose company Plan B backed the film] was amazing. I was lucky enough to work with people who understood what I was trying to do. They gave me their trust. I had final cut, and that was that.”
Hunger was a film which reopened a historical chapter which many had considered closed. Was that also his aim in 12 Years? “I don’t think people had looked into the subject matter very much, that relationship between slave and slave-owner,” he says simply. “That is what I wanted to do. It is such a huge part of history, and there was a certain kind of examination or reflection it hadn’t been given. It is very, very important to look back in order to move forward.”
“A lot of people didn’t want the movie made,” he says suddenly. I ask if he was able to understand that. “Yes, because people want to close their eyes on some subjects. They want to keep on going, they don’t want to look behind them.”

The success of the film – Solomon Northup’s 1853 memoir was proposed to him by his long-time partner, the critic Bianca Stigter – comfortably surpassed his expectations, he says. “I am very happy the film did so well, and that people have been talking about the subject in a real way.” It has had a more visceral effect too. A producer McQueen knows in Toronto told the director of his experience when he saw the film: “There was a black woman sitting next to him, in her thirties or forties, and as the movie’s final part was beginning, she put her hand on his hand. They held hands. And when the titles came up, they fell into each other’s arms, crying. And that is not the first time I have heard a story like that.”
But in addition to the film’s considerable emotional impact on audiences, it is the longer-lasting resonances that give McQueen satisfaction. He has taken part in numerous post-screening debates, which have mostly been “electrifying”. One woman stood up to reveal, for the first time in public, that her father had been poisoned for teaching children how to read. “She had never talked about it before like that,” he says. “Art can do that. Art can start a conversation.”
It is not a conversation that shows any sign of fizzling out: McQueen is now involved in President Obama’s charity for young people, My Brother’s Keeper, and he has also been instrumental in promoting a scheme that will see the film and book of 12 Years available to every school in America. “I really wanted that to happen,” he says, adding that he would also like to see the initiative in the UK.
A lot of people didn’t want ‘12 Years’ made. People want to close their eyes on some subjects, they don’t want to look behind them’
He seems to relish plunging into controversial subjects, I say. Shame, his second feature film, was an extraordinarily candid view of the unheralded extremes of male sexuality. “That’s still not sorted,” he says quickly. “That is unfinished business. I really want to come back to that.” Why was that? “It is an extremely fascinating subject. But no one talks about it. Let’s get real! So many important decisions in the world are connected with the sexual appetites of important men. Whether it is JFK, or Clinton, or Martin Luther King. That is what we are. That is part of us. But sometimes people are embarrassed by their pleasures.
“It is a huge subject. So many people came out after that film and sent me anonymous letters, a lot of thank-yous, and some crazy stuff too.” What did women think of it, I ask? “I don’t know how much women know, or want to know, about men’s sexual appetites. A friend of mine went to see it with his wife, and she asked him, ‘Do those things really happen?’ And he was, like, ‘No, no, it is just a fantasy, it is just the movies.’” McQueen’s laugh suggests otherwise.
Politics, priapism and persecution: McQueen’s first three films have delved fearlessly into taboo themes. Does he feel he has to screw his courage to the sticking-place when he is looking for a subject? “No, not at all. Sex addiction, hunger strikes, slavery – these are huge subjects. And for some reason people don’t want to take them on.” What is that reason? “I have no idea. But those are the subjects I want to engage with. I want to narrate them, see them, think about them, grapple with them.”
Notwithstanding his ability to focus like a hawk on the most divisive of contemporary themes, McQueen, it strikes me, is the most traditional of artists, balancing the claims of truth and beauty as he picks at the scabs of social injustice and human suffering. More than one critic was struck by the innocent loveliness of many of the images in 12 Years, some suggesting that it was a distraction from the film’s uglier themes. McQueen won’t have that. “I wasn’t making a horror movie. Have you ever been to New Orleans? It is the most beautiful place. And yes, these things happened there.
“The world is perverse. And sometimes perversity happens in the most beautiful places. That is what it is all about. You can still go to the American south and visit these whitewashed plantations, and a Scarlett O’Hara figure will give you a guided tour of the place, offer you lemonade or ice cool tea, and show you where the cotton was picked, as if it were Disney World.
“That is where these perverse things happened. And that is what I wanted to show, exactly as it was. Deal with it.”

Booming mkt revives investors interest in equity NFOsBooming market revives retail investors’ interest in equity NFOs
Rajesh Naidu & Ashutosh R Shyam, ET Bureau Oct 5, 2014, 05.52AM IST

(According AMFI data,…)
ET Intelligence Group: A buoyant equity market has created a buzz among retail investors who have put the highest amount in equity new fund offers (NFOs) in August since January 2010.
According to data provided by AMFI ( Association of Mutual Funds of India ), equity NFOs attracted Rs 1,229 crore in August, the highest since the Rs 1,590 crore collected in January 2010. Fund managers believe asset management companies ( AMC ) will come up with more such offerings if market remains bright and breezy.
Atul Bole, fund manager of Tata Asset Management, said, "This is a common development in bull markets. Retail investors have been chasing equities in the last one year since returns have been strong. Interestingly, returns from equities have been significantly higher than other financial saving instruments."
A large part of the inflows in the last few months have been due to corporates shifting investments from debt to equity after the government increased the long-term capital gains tax on nonequity funds, he said.
There are two important reasons behind the increase in inflows in equity NFOs. First, Indian equity market was the best performing since the beginning of this year, delivering returns of 25%, which has attracted considerable interest — and inflow — to such schemes.
Also, new investors have diverted their financial savings into the equity market. The NFOs are also cheaper — unit price of Rs10 — than some existing equity schemes whose net asset values (NAV) have risen in the recent bull run.
Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company chief executive officer (CEO) A Balasubramanian said, "In the recent months, equities have become an enticing investment option for retail investors. There's high willingness to participate in equity as an asset class. We believe the rate of inflows will sustain in the coming months and would surpass the January 2010 inflows of Rs 1,590 crore."
Most equity schemes launched recently have been close-ended, which have lock-in periods and provide liquidity to fund managers to carefully choose investments in the market.

If voted to power  Sena will expose all scams  files: Uddhav Thackeray11
0
Mumbai: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has said that he would initiate an inquiry into the alleged multi-crore irrigation scam and probe the "hasty approval" of builder files by former CM Prithviraj Chavan, if his party is voted to power.
"Once they (Cong-NCP) were good friends, now they are leaving no stone unturned to stab each other. One (Ajit Pawar) says he will file RTI queries to get the documents that Chavan signed and the other (Chavan) says law will catch up with him as it did with Jayalalithaa. But both of them should not worry. I will open all your files and get the truth out when voted to power," Thackeray said here last night.
He was addressing a Dusshera rally at suburban Borivali that was attended by several Sena men as well as RPI leaders like Ram Pandagale and Arjun Dangle.
Thackeray announced the construction of a Bal Thackeray memorial on capturing power.

Thackeray also announced the construction of a Bal Thackeray memorial on capturing power.
"We will ensure that a memorial of international standards of my father Bal Thackeray is constructed when we come to power in the state. But I do not want any favours from other parties for this," he said.
Taking a dig at BJP's campaign slogan revolving around Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maratha warrior king Shivaji Maharaj, Thackeray said that the Sena will not bend down.
"Our king Shivaji Maharaj has taught us to not bow down before Delhi. So we will never do that," Thackeray said. Playing the Gujarati card, Thackeray said it is the Sena, due to which Gujaratis are still present in Maharashtra.
"In 1992 if the Sena had not been there, the Gujaratis would have fled to Gujarat. But we ensured their safety which is why they are in Mumbai today," he said.
On Friday, departing from its 40-year-old tradition, the Sena skipped holding the Dusshera rally in Shivaji Park owing to the model code of conduct being in force and instead performed a 'shastra puja' at the memorial of late Bal Thackeray there.

North Korea s No. 2 visits South for rare talksHwang Pyong So, center left, vice chairman of North Korea’s National Defense Commission, and Choe Ryong Hae, center right, a secretary of North Korea’s ruling Workers' Party, arrive at the Incheon International Airport in Incheon. (SOurce: AP)
AP | Seoul | Posted: October 4, 2014 12:36 pm
North Korea’s presumptive No. 2 led members of Pyongyang’s inner circle on a rare trip Saturday to South Korea for the close of the Asian Games, with the rivals holding their highest level face-to-face talks in five years.
After months of tensions, including a steady stream of insults between the divided neighbors and an unusual number of North Korean missile and rocket test firings, expectations for a breakthrough weren’t high, but even the visit itself was significant, allowing valuable contact between confidants of North Korea’s authoritarian leader and Seoul’s senior official for North Korean affairs.
One analyst called it a “golden opportunity” for South Korean President Park Geun-hye to test North Korea’s willingness, at the highest levels, to improve shaky ties, but it seemed unlikely that Park would meet with the aides to North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un.
The North Korean delegation to the games in the South Korean port city of Incheon was led by Hwang Pyong So, the top political officer for the Korean People’s Army and considered by outside analysts to be the country’s second most important official after Kim. Hwang is also a vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission led by Kim and a vice marshal of the army.
The visit comes amid rumors in Seoul about the health of Kim, who has made no public appearances since Sept. 3 and skipped a high-profile recent event he usually attends. A recent official documentary showed footage from August of him limping and overweight and mentioned his “discomfort.”
It wasn’t immediately clear what Hwang and his delegation talked about in a closed-door lunch meeting with South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae and national security director Kim Kwan-jin. Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong Cheol told reporters that there were no plans for the North Koreans to meet with President Park.
That could be a mistake, an American analyst in Seoul said. This visit of “a very high-octane group” offers Park a unique chance “to test the North Korean leadership’s will and intentions,” said John Delury, an Asia specialist at Seoul’s Yonsei University.

Both sides expressed hope for better relations in comments to the media ahead of the talks.

BJP President Amit Shah
Muzaffarnagar, Oct 4:  
Two policemen who were involved in preparation of the charge sheet against BJP President Amit Shah for alleged hate speech, which was rejected by a local court, have been transferred.
Deputy Superintendent of Police (New Mandi Circle) Yogender Singh and Investigation Officer of the case Sub-Inspector Bharat Lal were shifted yesterday.
SSP H N Singh, however, said it is a routine transfer and has no connection with the Amit Shah case.
Deputy SP Yogender Singh has been shifted to police lines from the Circle of New Mandi, while Sub-Inspector Bharat Lal has been shifted to Bhorakala Police Station from the New Mandi Police Station, he said.
SI Bharat Lal had investigated the case while Dy SP Yogender Singh had filed the charge sheet in the court.
Shah was charge sheeted by the police on September 10 for his alleged hate speech during campaigning here for the Lok Sabha elections.
The court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Sunder Lal on September 11 refused to take cognisance of the charge sheet against BJP President Amit Shah in connection with the alleged hate speech made by him and returned it to the police.
Lal had refused to take cognisance of the charge sheet as police had not followed the provisions of 173[2] CrPc in which they did not try to arrest the accused before filing the charge sheet in court.
Returning the charge sheet to remove errors, the court had said police cannot file a charge sheet under section 188 IPC as it should be filed as a private complaint by the officer concerned, who had imposed prohibitory orders which were violated.

Lalu attributes stampede to administrative 'lapse'

Patna: RJD president Lalu Prasad on Saturday said the stampede outside Gandhi Maidan which left 33 dead appears to be a result of administrative "lapse" and expressed dismay over the administration's inability to make foolproof arrangements despite several unpleasant incidents in the past at the grounds in the heart of the capital.
"Gandhi maidan stampede appears to be a matter of administrative lapse," Prasad wrote on micro-blogging website Twitter.
"Stern action shall be taken against officials found guilty. I am keeping a watch over the event," he said.
"Gandhi maidan stampede appears to be a matter of administrative lapse," Prasad wrote on micro-blogging website Twitter.
"From the beginning we have been demanding that height of the boundary wall of the Gandhi Maidan should be lowered and there should be more and more entry and exit points in the maidan," Prasad said.
The RJD is extending support to Jitan Ram Manjhi Government in Bihar.
Prasad said he was very sorry that he could not reach Patna due to health problem.
He repeated the helpline number 0612-2219810 released by the district administration for the relatives of the stampede victims.
Earlier known as the "Patna Lawns," Gandhi Maidan is a historic ground at Patna near the banks of the Ganga. Several movements were launched on the Patna Lawns during the freedom struggle, the most important being the Champaran movement and the Quit India movement of 1942.
Jaiprakash Narayan had launched his movement against Congress from the same Gandhi Maidan in 1974.

PM Narendra Modi slams Congress, seeks clear mandate for Haryana's development
PTI Oct 4, 2014, 01.26PM IST

Congress
(Attacking the ruling Congress…)
KARNAL (HARYANA): Continuing his Lok Sabha plank of ousting the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today sought a clear mandate for the BJP in Haryana for putting the state on a growth trajectory.
Kicking off his party's poll campaign in Haryana, he hit out at the Congress for the state's backwardness.
Modi said that today the entire world was looking at India with greater respect and this had happened not because of him, but the power of 125 crore people of India, who had formed a strong and stable government at the Centre.
"Why has India's pride increased today? It is not because of Modi, it is because 125 crore people of India have formed a stable and strong government in Delhi. This is your magic not Modi's magic. Do you want that Haryana's name also echo around the world."
"Its first condition is that there should be 'Congress mukt Haryana'. The second that a stable government with full majority should be formed. And third, there should be a government which lets Modi work in Haryana," he said.
Attacking the ruling Congress in the state, Modi said that those who could not do anything for the last 60 years were now asking for his record in 60 days.
"The people who could not do anything in 60 years, they are asking for my 60 day record," he said.
In his 30-minute address at a rally here, Modi, while describing the ruling Congress as "anti-farmer", was also critical of the party's claim that Haryana was No 1 State.
He said the state lagged behind in several parameters including literacy rate, per capita income, poverty alleviation, health, education, among others.
Modi also launched a veiled attack on main opposition INLD, asking the people whether they would like the State being governed from jail.
INLD President and former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala has been sentenced in the teachers recruitment scam.
Chautala, who is out on bail on health grounds, had said that he would take oath as the next CM from Tihar Jail.
Seeking to connect with the farmers of the state, Modi hit out at the Congress for stating that the Centre had imposed ban on Basmati rice export.
"I am surprised that is it necessary to speak lies in polls. I do not need to tell, but you know all my farmer brother and sisters are being misled, you are being told that Centre has imposed a ban on Basmati rice export, which is 100 per cent lies and injustice to the farmers," he said.
Modi said Haryana was levying four per cent tax which was fetching lesser price for Basmati growers.
Launching a scathing attack on the Congress over alleged land scams, Modi said thousands of acres of land had vanished and farmers were deprived of adequate compensation.
"Who has taken these lands, I want to ask you did you get compensation for your land. Where has the thousands of acres of land have gone, who has taken it," he said.
"Who is anti-farmer, you have to decide. We have to change this, for this I want a clear mandate in Haryana, make our candidates victorious...,"
 
At the outset, Modi sought to strike an emotional chord with the people, saying he had come to Haryana to campaign, a day after the Vijay Dashmi festival was celebrated.
He said Haryana was the land of "Daanveer Karan", the land on which the Mahabharata battle was fought and holy Gita's message was delivered.
"This election will decide Haryana's future. I am sitting in your neighbourhood (Delhi)," Modi said.
Recalling the days he used to work in the State as a partyman, Modi said he wanted to repay the debt as he had received love and affection from the people here.
He told the people if they wanted employment, overall progress, development in villages, in cities, then change in Haryana was necessary.
"Do you want that I should serve you, I want your blessings for that and government with absolute majority, give me an opportunity to undertake development," he said.
Talking about the new route for Kailash Mansarovar yatra, he said the route existed even when Congress was in power but they had failed to do anything.
"Kailash Mansarovar was there when Congress government was there. But going there was very difficult. The work which Congress could not do, we did it in such a short time....we managed to make China understand and opened a second road to visit Kailash Mansoravar. And now one can visit Kailash Mansarovar by road," he said.
Modi also touched upon a number of schemes initiated by the Centre including Jan Dhan scheme.
Elections to the 90-member Haryana Assembly will be held on October 15.
Haryana is set to witness a multi-corner contest with key players Congress, BJP, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP), BSP, Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC)-Jan Chetna Manch (JCM) alliance all set to cross swords.
In the last Assembly elections, Congress had won 40 seats, INLD 31, BJP 4, HJC-BL 6, SAD and BSP one each and seven seats had gone to Independents.

Indian mkt not cheap, but huge scope for better growth: GMO
Arjun Divecha, Head - EMs Equity, GMO LLC believes the emerging markets (EMs) are moderately attractive right now as the in the past few months the markets have forced the countries to enforce better policy-making.
Post your opinion here
Special Show
Arjun Divecha, Head - EMs Equity, GMO LLC believes that though a significant amount of economic bottoming out is priced in and the market is cuurently not cheap, there is a good scope for better gains.
“A lot of the cyclical companies’ earnings have been kind of at a fairly low level for the last few years. So, those companies I think really have the potential to increase their earnings quite substantially. So, we are kind of guardedly optimistic,” he says in an interview to CNBC-TV18.
Furthermore, Divecha believes the emerging markets (EMs) are moderately attractive right now as the markets forced the countries to enforce better policy-making. He is positive on Indian growth and China where he expects slow growth, but positive nonetheless.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.
Q: Let me start by asking you about your view as far as emerging markets (EMs) are concerned? We were in conversation with a bunch of other market voices Ruchir Sharma, Rajeev Bhaman and both of them believe that EMs look a bit mixed at this point in time given the geopolitical risks and other factors. What is your own take on EMs and whether they look stronger today or not?
A: They look stronger than they have in the last 3 or 4 years. That is partially because of two factors, one is that for the last few years a number of EMs have performed rather poorly both from an economic and stock market point of view primarily because of what I consider to be bad policy-making in a lot of these countries.
The good news is that we had this fragile five phenomenon last year and what that did was force a number of countries to kind of make adjustments. So, markets have kind of enforced an adjustment in a number of these countries. Also, in a number of the other cases like in India and Indonesia, we have had elections which have led to more reform oriented governments. So, between market forces and politics, I think we are in a better place today than we have been in the last few years.
Again this is by no means unequivocal, this is not across the board but net-net when you add it all up, when you couple it with relatively reasonable valuations I think the emerging markets actually look moderately attractive.
Q: Let me ask you about India in specific and I go back to my conversations with Ruchir and Rajeev and Ruchir said that he is feeling nervously optimistic about India at this point in time because there is no contrarian voice on India and that is making him nervous. Rajeev believes that the Indian markets have the potential to double over the next 5 years as long as companies do the right thing and of course the government implements the promises that it is articulating. What is your own take on the strength as far as the Indian market is concerned?
A: My view basically is that even had you not had this particular election outcome, even if you had a different election outcome, India was kind of bottoming out from a cyclical point of view anyway. So, you would have got a cyclical growth coming out sometime this year or next year. Hence, we would have seen the kind of cyclical bounce anyway, to the extent that the government is successful in implementing more reforms that will go even further than that. So, therefore I would say over the next few years certainly over the next 4 or 5 years I am actually quite optimistic that the economy will in fact recover and do quite well.
The question then becomes how much of it is priced into the market? The market certainly is not cheap however I agree with the point of view especially with a lot of the cyclical companies earnings have been kind of at a fairly low level for the last few years. So, those companies I think really have the potential to increase their earnings quite substantially. So, we are kind of guardedly optimistic.
As far as what Ruchir said about being kind of nervously optimistic I would say one of my favourite sayings is that the herd is not always wrong, it is only mostly wrong. So, this might be one of the cases where the herd is actually right.
Q: Let me ask you about the India China comparison because you track China closely as well. At this point in time there are question marks on just how much lower we are actually to see China slow down. We have already seen GDP forecast being cut for China whether you give that enough credence or not is a different story altogether but between India and China today what would you much rather bet on?
A: They both look quite attractive from a stock market point of view because in China you have had a situation where growth has been slowing and people have become quite negative on it and you do have a number of sectors in the Chinese stock market that look quite attractive from a valuation point of view. There is really some good value to be had over there. So, on one hand growth is slowing but I don’t see some kind of a crisis. I don’t see that China is going to fall off a cliff. If that was going to happen obviously you don’t want to be invested in that stock market. So, we think that Chinese growth is going to continue to slow over the next few years but we don’t think that there is some catastrophe in the making over here.
Valuations obviously matter a lot. So on one hand I would say India's growth is going to increase but the market to some extent reflects that. In China's case growth is going to slow but the market to some extent reflects that. So, I see opportunities in both places.
Q: You said that this time around the herd may probably get it right as far as India is concerned. Would you consider then upping your allocation for India given the fact that at this point in time it looks to be the relative outperformer as far as the emerging market basket is concerned?
A: I don’t care about who has been the outperformer so far; that is not important. What is important is what it is going to do from here. We have increased our allocation to India over the last year. So, if one goes back to September a year ago, we had very little money in India and we were quite negative on the country.
Over the last few years we have increased our weight, so, in various areas we have decent weighting in India. I wouldn’t say we are massively overweight, we don’t have a huge weight on India but we certainly have quite a bit more than we did a year ago and basically to the extent that we see reforms starting to take hold, we would certainly be inclined to become more positive.
Q: Which are the sectors that are looking attractive to you both from a valuation perspective as well as the possibility of the reform agenda being pushed forward from this government? Which are the sectors that you would be most confident about investing in at this point in time?
A: There are number of different sectors that are interesting. Again, taking a bit of a longer view rather than kind of forecast what is going to happen in next three or six months, I will say look at five years.
The sectors that are particularly attractive to people like us are what I would call kind of the domestic cyclicals. So, these are the companies that benefit when the domestic economy does well as opposed to the export economy or metals or mining or things like that.
So, these are the kind of metals, the construction companies, people like that. These are the companies whose earnings have been quite depressed over the last few years and one has to be very selective about picking them because some of them have a lot of debt and they may not be able to recover from the levels of debt and things like that. So, one has to be pretty selective. I wouldn’t blindly be buying in entire sector but in some senses it is the whole domestic economy that we see starting to recover quite a bit and that is where we want to be placing out bets
Q: I was looking at your sectoral allocations across your funds. Banks are pretty high up there in the pecking order. Do you like the banking story in India and are you willing to look at PSU banks or would you only stick with private sector banks?
A: Included in my domestic recovery story, banks are the highest leveraged play on this phenomenon. In some sense if you are going to get this kind of industrial recovery so to speak, banks are the highest leveraged to that particular play. So, I see banks as being the most attractive place within that. If one looks at it, we have one of our funds that focuses purely on domestic opportunities within emerging markets and within that the biggest sector that we have is Indian banks.

Srinagar: Army on Saturday "saluted" the efforts put in by the youth of Kashmir Valley during the devastating floods and said if it were not for the young men, the force would not have been able to effectively accomplish the mission of rescuing people.
"Probably, it is my men on the ground who have actually seen how effective and how important the role of the youth was. Every second or third boat of mine went to the local volunteers. If it was not for these local youths, who had guided us to reach the places, I cannot say how we would have been able to accomplish the mission," General Officer Commanding of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps Lt Gen Subrata Saha told reporters.
"As far as the Army is concerned, it salutes the efforts put in by the youth, (both) with us and also by themselves. We are deeply conscious because we have seen it with our own eyes. My own officers and men have conveyed this to me at various forums at all places and they all had lots of tales to tell of the great, great efforts of the youth," he said.
Lt Gen Saha said the people of the Valley deserve all the respect and admiration for what they did during the floods.

Lt Gen Saha said the people of the Valley deserve all the respect and admiration for what they did during the floods.
"On so many occasions, when boats reached (submerged) houses, the inhabitants of particular house said 'no, not me, please go to the neighbour's house, they need it more than I do'. The people, the youth, they all have my respect and admiration for what they have done," he said.
The Commander, while commenting on a controversy surrounding the portrayal of Army in a recent movie, said art must have its own place.
"Honestly, I do not have time to watch movies. As a matter of principle, art is an expression and it must have its own place," he said.

Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 2:57 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 8:18 am
The Centre on Saturday assured all help to the Bihar government to deal with the stampede tragedy in Patna that has left 33 persons dead.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh telephoned Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on Saturday morning and promised all help.
“The Bihar Chief Minister apprised me of the latest developments,” Singh tweeted.
Singh assured Manjhi of all help from the Centre including medical assistance and asked him to provide medical treatment to the injured.
Soon after the stampede on Friday night, Singh had spoken to Manjhi.
RJD president Lalu Prasad on Saturday said the stampede outside Gandhi Maidan which left 33 dead appears to be a result of administrative “lapse” and expressed dismay over the administration’s inability to make foolproof arrangements despite several unpleasant incidents in the past at the grounds in the heart of the capital.
As many as 33 people were killed in the stampede outside the huge Gandhi Maidan in Patna after Dussehra celebrations last night.
The tragedy struck at around 7 PM on Friday at the South East corner of the ground near the Exhibition road when the people who were were returning after watching the “Ravana Vadh” (killing of demon king) jostled with each other to move ahead.
Among those killed in the stampede, 21 were women, 10 minors including seven girls and three men.

Markets in consolidation mode; Sensex down 58 points during the truncated last week

MUMBAI: Markets seemed to be in consolidation mode after strong rally as the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex and CNX Nifty declined 58.33 points and 23.30 points, respectively during the truncated week as operators decided to play safe after the Reserve Bank kept key interest rates unchanged.
Realty, metal, banking, power, capital goods and FMCG sectors attracted profit-booking and mainly weighed on Sensex.
However, buying was seen prominently in defensive IT and pharma stocks. Shares of IT majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro notched up 3.5-5.0 per cent gains, tracking weakness in rupee against the US dollar and strong American economic data that boosts prospects of their biggest market.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, in monetary policy meet on Tuesday, kept the key rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive time, citing continued risks to inflation and difficult external situation.
The short-term lending rate remained at eight per cent, and the cash reserve requirement of banks at four per cent. The statutory liquidity ratio has also been retained at 22 per cent.
Brokers said local bourses were also impacted by weak trend on Asian bourses amid concern over tensions in Hong Kong and as Chinese manufacturing gauge missing estimates.
The BSE 30-share barometer resumed lower and moved in a range of 26,851.33 and 26,481.31 before concluding the week at 26,567.99, a net fall of 58.33 points or 0.22 per cent.
Last week, it had plunged by 464.10 points, or 1.71 per cent.
Similarly, the broad-based 50-issue CNX Nifty of the NSE also declined by 23.30 points, or 0.29 per cent, to 7,945.55.
The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) were closed on October 2nd and 3rd for observing 'Mahatma Gandhi Jayanthi' and 'Dussehra' and will also remain shut on Monday, October 6, on account of 'Bakra Id'.
The Reserve Bank (RBI) retained growth projection for current fiscal at 5.5 per cent and also said that future policy stance will be influenced by inflation outlook.
It said that the pick-up in GDP growth during Q1 may not be sustained in the next quarters.
Some more selling pressure may be seen in the coming sessions, particularly in rate sensitive sectors. Also, as long market holidays are coming, investors prefer to book profits.
In the coming sessions, global cues and second quarterly results shall be key triggers for market direction," said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
Slowing down of capital inflows from FPIs/FIIs also affected the market sentiment. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth Rs 11.22 crore during the week, including provisional figure of October 1.
Jignesh Chaudhary, Head of Research, Veracity Broking Services said: "During the week, credit policy was announced and for the fourth consecutive time, RBI kept the key policy rates unchanged.
"RBI also stated that henceforth any changes in the key rates will be purely dependent on inflation. There was not any impact on the local markets as the outcome from the RBI credit policy was anticipated by markets."
"Growing political tension in Hong Kong and speculation over US interest rates along with geopolitical tension in Middle East forced other Asian markets to trade low and post the biggest quarterly drop in global equities for more than two years.
"In the coming week, the trading technicals are suggesting that the markets would be in positive trend, the CNX Nifty is expected to trade in the range of 7,900 to 8,060 and BSE Sensex is expected to trade in the range of 26,400 to 26,700," he added.
22 scrips out of the 30-share Sensex pack ended lower while 8 others finished higher.
Major losers were Tata Steel (5.38 per cent), Tata Power (3.97 per cent), ICICI Bank (3.36 per cent), BHEL (2.73 per cent), ONGC (2.32 per cent), Axis Bank (2.27 per cent), HUL (2.27 per cent), Maruti (2.19 per cent), ITC (2.07 per cent), Larsen (2.07 per cent), SSLT (1.58 per cent), Hindalco (1.43 per cent) and Coal India (1.18 per cent).
However, Sun Pharma rose by 6.61 per cent, followed by Wipro (5.03 per cent), Infosys (4.51 per cent), TCS (3.46 per cent), Cipla (1.92 per cent), HDFC (1.21 per cent) and Gail (1.18 per cent).
Among the S&P BSE sectoral indices, Realty fell by 3.52 per cent, followed by Metal (2.46 per cent), Bankex (1.80 per cent), Power (1.65 per cent), CG (1.53 per cent) and FMCG (1.52 per cent) while IT rose by 3.55 per cent, HC (3.20 per cent), Teck (2.80 per cent) and CD (2.70 per cent).
Mid-cap and Small-cap indices also rose by 1.24 per cent and 0.96 per cent, respectively on renewed demand from retail investors.
  The total turnover at BSE and NSE fell to Rs 9,237.07 crore and Rs 43,382.07 crore from the last weekend's level of Rs 17,646.48 crore and Rs 89,849.82 crore, respectively.

Jayalalithaa not getting VIP treatment: jail officialprison
"She has conducted herself very politely with the prison officials and not made any demand for luxury"
AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa is not getting VIP treatment, but being looked after as any other ordinary prisoner at the Parapanna Agrahara Central prison where she is lodged after conviction in the disproportionate assets case, according to a top jail official.
“Madam (Jayalalithaa) is getting no VIP treatment. She is being treated as any other prisoner at Parapanna Agrahara,” DIG Prisons P M Jaisimha said.
She has conducted herself very politely with the prison officials and not made any demand for luxury, except that she has asked for an iron cot as per doctors’ advise, he said.
Ms. Jayalalithaa has not even asked for a television set, while a common TV is provided even for ordinary prisoners, he said.
“Since Jayalalithaa is a short-termer (a prisoner who is not undergoing rigorous imprisonment), she is allowed to wear her garments, he said. She is happy wearing sarees only and she is not wearing any cosmetics either, Mr. Jaisimha added.
Ms. Jayalalithaa also is being looked after by her close aide Sasikala and Elavarasi, the latter’s relative, who have also been imprisoned in the same women’s barracks, he said.
The AIADMK chief is keeping good health and eating simple food as per doctors’ advice, besides reading newspapers, Mr. Jaisimha said. “She is eating brown bread, milk, biscuits, fruits and chappatis, if she demands,” he said.
The 66-year-old three-time chief minister, who has been allotted VVIP cell number 23 of the prison, also reads newspapers without fail, Mr. Jaisimha said. “Without any fail, madam reads three English dailies every day,” he said.
Ms. Jayalalithaa, who is now prisoner number 7402 at the jail, wakes up early in the morning and takes a stroll in the premises of the prison, the official said.
Sasikala and her relatives, Elavarasi and Sudhakaran have been given prisoner numbers 7403, 7404 and 7405 respectively. The Special Court has sent Ms. Jayalalithaa and three other accused to four years in jail.

Singapore isnt the global city of the future after allWhat does it mean to be Singaporean?(Reuters/Edgar Su)

Years ago, I wrote about how I would search the library shelves of my New Jersey elementary school in the hopes of finding a character that looked like me in children’s books. One day my librarian handed me a copy of The Jungle Book. Though I had never revisited Kipling’s India—it wasn’t about the India my parents knew and loved or the India that I frequently visited on long, hot summer vacation—I remained an insatiable reader throughout my childhood and became a children’s book author myself, telling stories that I would have liked to have read as a young person.
Now, as a parent living in Singapore and raising a third culture kid who happens to be categorized as one of Singapore’s “official” ethnicities or “races,” I had expected my child’s journey of discovery to be easier than mine had been. Given that nearly 9% of Singaporeans and permanent residents trace their ancestry, wholly or in part, to the Indian subcontinent, I’d expected more visible signs and celebrations of Indianness. Moreover, Singapore touts its vibrant and diverse cultural heritage and has often prided itself on being a good example of multiculturalism at work, even though it is nearly 74% ethnically Chinese. So badly, I had wanted my child to experience diversity as I never had.
As I discover more books for young readers, though, especially of realistic stories set in Singapore, I cannot help but notice, and be saddened by, how few commercially-published fiction titles feature non-Chinese children as protagonists in realistic, contemporary settings. This speaks to a hierarchy of race that is wholly apparent to those of us who are not at the top. These books are peppered with the occasional non-Chinese Asian character, but these characters represent “diversity” only on a visual level. The characters hardly make it past their function as a visual supplement or plot device.
“Rarely are we people on our own with story lines not connected to Chinese people,” says Arya Sita Ramana, independent scholar and social justice activist who works on race relations.
“Only state-sponsored banners seem to feel obliged to dutifully represent the Singaporean in every shade,” writes Surekha A. Yadav in her widely-circulated commentary “ Is Singapore a Racist Country? ” that appeared in The Malay Mail in August. In it, Yadav writes of a “persistent and pervasive Chinese chauvinism” that often underlies Singapore as a nation.
“The Chinese identity… is the default identity,” she wrote. “If you aren’t Chinese, you need to justify your Singaporeaness, and even so, you’ll never be quite as Singaporean as a Singaporean Chinese.”
This chauvinism, dubbed as #ChinesePrivilege on social media, is the “systemic, racialized, and institutional privilege in the country as opposed to the countries’ minorities (primarily racialized as Indian and Malay),” writes Dr. Adeline Koh, associate professor at Richard Stockton College, in the provocatively-titled “ To My Dear Fellow Singapore Chinese: Shut Up When a Minority is Talking about Race ,” an essay on Medium. “[It] functions very similarly to white privilege in the United States,” she says.
And that white privilege, with which I am very familiar, also manifests itself here in Singapore. White characters often appear in titles I find in our library branch. Some books include Caucasian faces, but no discernable non-Chinese Asian characters. Others feature mixed race children—often part-Chinese and part-Caucasian. White expatriates, too, have their place on shelves here. Several titles feature American and European children exploring Singapore with abandon.
Admittedly books about Singaporean children and teens written by Singaporean writers are a very recent phenomenon. My friends here, of all races and ethnicities, tell me that they grew up on colonialist British literature, just as I did; “Crumpets, treacle, and ‘beastly,’” in their words. There are no official statistics as to the number of books for young readers published in Singapore, but Adan Jimenez, assistant director of the National Book Development Council of Singapore, a literary non-profit, and co-author of the middle-grade series, Sherlock Sam, says, “A total of 73 children’s and YA books were published in Singapore in 2013, nearly double the number of books published in 2012.” However, the rapidly growing industry has a long way to go before reflecting the country’s rich diversity of races and cultures.
While children’s books published in America continue to miss the modern diversity of the United States, a school librarian New York City, our home city, is less likely to hand my child Kipling than an enthusiastic librarian did to me all those years ago. My toddler has a shelf full of books about or set in South Asian America, many more than I had when I was only one of few South Asian Americans in my sleepy suburban town. I’ll admit I glow when she asks to read my book at bedtime.
My toddler loves spotting the familiar sights, sounds, and smells of her adopted home—the MRT, the botanic gardens, the hawker centers—in her “Singapore books.” But I recoil when I see no brown faces like hers as stars on the page, though she sees many brown faces at school, on the train, in the malls. Wouldn’t it be nice, I think, if parents, teachers, and librarians here had stacks of books to recommend to all young readers looking for their experiences reflected in the pages of a book?
There is certainly a need for such a conversation among readers and writers, but it is difficult to get it started. “One function of privilege is its invisibility,” says Ramana. “It functions so insidiously that both those who have it, and those who don’t, cannot see oftentimes how it works.”
“There are many social fault lines in Singapore, especially in terms of race and class,” says Kirsten Han, freelance journalist and social justice blogger. “Yet the official narratives, not to mention laws like the Sedition Act, of racial harmony and meritocracy have erased race and class from the public discourse, leaving us so uncritical of our own privileges that many Chinese Singaporeans are sincerely convinced there wouldn’t be much to say on these issues anyway.”

Quartz Weekend BriefHong Kong vs Goliath  American marriage  cocktail calculator  tech sexismQuartz Staff
October 3, 2014
You’d think we’d know better by now. The Egyptians who ousted Hosni Mubarak eventually wound up with an even more brutal dictatorship. The Ukrainians who kicked out Russian stooge Viktor Yanukovych got a Russian invasion. Moscow strangled the Bolotnaya Square protests. The Occupy movement withered on the vine.
Yet here we are again, cheering on Hong Kong’s democracy campaigners, wanting to believe that a small territory’s civil movement will triumph against a massive, entrenched state apparatus.
Why? In part because we see a story—David vs Goliath—that’s one of the best stories there is. And few revolutions have been blessed with so David-like a figure as Joshua Wong , the slight, 17-year-old hero of the Hong Kong barricades.
For now, David is on a roll. As we’ve been reporting, the student-led movement has moved well beyond students  and seriously disrupted the territory’s rhythm. And China is worried. It’s  exercising energetic censorship —to stop the democracy fever spreading to restive areas like Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as to avoid riling up anti-Hong Kong jingoism in the rest of the populace. The  stark warnings  it has given the protestors, meanwhile, evoke  fearful echoes of Tiananmen .
But this Goliath has something better than force on its side: time. Hong Kong is still a  global hub of finance and trade , but  faces growing competition , and its relative economic importance to mainland China is shrinking . If the protests drag on, they’ll weaken Hong Kong economically far more than the mainland. And the longer they last, the better the authorities will get at exploiting the demonstrators’ fatigue and  internal divisions .
So now it’s a waiting game. If the protestors remain unusually unified—or if mainland Chinese, hitherto indifferent , swing around to support them—China might have to back down.
But it seems unlikely. The real reason we find David vs Goliath stories so irresistible to watch is that, in most of them, David loses.—Gideon Lichfield
Five things on Quartz we especially liked
Narendra Modi is not Evita Peron. India’s prime minister got rock-star treatment when he came to New York, but let’s get one thing straight, says Manu Baghavan: Comparing him to  Reagan, Thatcher, or Evita  is a misleading way to understand a complex, nuanced politician.
How American parenting is killing the American marriage. Danielle and Astro Teller, known for their criticisms of the institution of marriage, now set their sights on the religion of parenting, which preaches the dogma that children are the most important thing in life and persecutes heretics with zeal .
The family tree of beer. Want to know which multinational conglomerate owns your favorite brewery? David Yanofsky has traced out the entire ownership structure of the global beer industry in a single handy diagram that fits on a barstool .
The complete guide to making your own lunch that’s better than takeout. Even if your budget allows you to buy gourmet sandwiches or popping out for fine sushi every single day, you’ll want to pack your own meals after reading Jenni Avins’ guide to healthy, homemade, transportable food .
Are you really going to pay $16/€14/£12 for that Sazerac? Having become a homemade lunch whiz, you might want to master mixology too after looking at Avins and Yanofsky’s cocktail calculator, which lets you tot up the price of the ingredients in a range of cocktails and see the massive markups that a bar charges .
Five things elsewhere that made us smarter
Are our planes too safe to fly? This long but gripping read in Vanity Fair by William Langewiesche relates the last hours of Air France flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic in 2009, and argues that automation has made crises so rare that even experienced pilots aren’t capable of handling one when it occurs .
Why nobody wants to host the 2022 Olympics. The whiff of corruption around the International Olympic Committee has become so strong that only two decidedly undemocratic countries—China and Kazakhstan—are interested in hosting the Winter Games. Dan Wetzel explains for Yahoo Sports why every other country pulled out  in the face of public opposition.
The new amateur terrorist hunters. Groups like the Islamic State are active on social media, and researchers and analysts are helping hunt them online independently of government agencies. Thanassis Cambanis at the Boston Globe examines the small, increasingly influential community scraping the web to track some of the world’s most dangerous groups.
Why we think we see ourselves in nature. Poets often use animals to “provide a metaphorical window into the human world,” writes Kathleen Rooney at the Poetry Foundation , despite their “very inhumanness.” She dissects a number of poems to explore how they balance the apparent relatability of beasts with the unknowable mystery of nature in the raw.
The myths behind tech’s sexism problem. Many in the technology industry cite “meritocracy” and a lack of women in the talent pipeline as the reason they’re largely absent. Ann Friedman at Medium  explains the cultural origins  of these problems, how companies like Etsy have made a dent, and the ways others can too.

Syrian state television airs footage of the Syrian President praying at a Damascus mosque to mark the Muslim festival of Eid-al-Adha
Syrian President Bashar Assad made a rare public appearance on Saturday by attending prayers at a mosque in the capital, Damascus, marking the beginning of an important Muslim holiday as an offensive by Islamic State near the border with Turkey intensified.
Syrian state television aired footage of Mr. Assad praying at the al-Numan Bin Bashir mosque along with government officials and the country’s Grand Mufti Ahmad Badreddine Hassoun. Most Muslims around the world on Saturday began marking the three-day holiday of Eid-al-Adha, or festival of sacrifice.
Mr. Assad has been making rare public appearances amid the country’s civil war, which activists say has killed more than 190,000 people. His last appearance was in July, when he attended prayers for the Eid-al-Fitr, which marks the end of fasting during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
To the north, intense fighting continued on the outskirts of the town of Kobani. Islamic State fighters are trying to capture the town to open a direct link between their positions in Aleppo and their stronghold of Raqqa to the east.
Kobani and its surrounding areas have been under attack since mid-September, with militants capturing dozens of nearby Kurdish villages. The assault, which has forced some 160,000 Syrians to flee, has left the Kurdish militiamen scrambling to repel the militants’ advance into the outskirts of the town, also known as Ayn Arab.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fighting concentrated on Saturday on the southwestern edge of the town, adding that members of the Islamic State group are shelling Kobani.
An Associated Press reporter monitoring the fighting from the Turkish border said the sound of heavy machine gun fire could be heard from Kobani. It was not immediately clear if jihadis were able to breach the town, defended by fighters of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPK.

Now a platform to help people organise hackathonsNow, a platform to help people organise hackathons
K  V Kurmanath
Tweet
Hyderabad, Oct. 4:  
With the number of app developers growing and more and more institutes organising hackathons, a group of like-minded techies have joined hands to start a hackathon platform that makes it easy for people to conduct hackathons. The platform will have an online presence at hyderabadhackers.in.
The number of hackathons has gone up significantly in the city. The success of August Fest, the maiden hackathon held at the national level, reflects the mood. The app developers, small and big, are taking up the challenges to build apps relevant for users of different mobile operating systems.
“The Metropolis is the latest example. We are organising two parallel hackathons – one with the help of the Telangana Government and the Hyderabad municipal authorities – to develop apps to improve quality of life in urban areas,” Hyderabad Software Exporters’ Association President Ramesh Loganathan told Business Line.
“Seeing interest in the app developers, the number of hackathons is growing up. But hosting a hackathon is not something very easy. The platform would save them from the hassle,” he said.
HYSEA, Startup Weekends, Angel Hack, Devthons, Uptech Idea Labs, Null Hyderabad, Hyderabad Entrepreneurship Society, Purple Talk and Telangana Academy of Skill and Knowledge (TASK) will jointly host the online platform.
The other hackathon is focussed on Internet of Things (IoT), where the organisers are providing with kits to developers to develop apps to build solutions for urban problems using sensors that are connected to the Internet. About 22 teams participated on Saturday for the Smart cities’ Devthon being held at the Engineering Staff College of India (ESCI).
“Besides offering the solutions, we would like to organise about 50 hacking and proto-typing events in the next 7-8 months,” Ramesh, who is also the Managing Director of Progress Software India, said.
Ramesh, who is actively associated with the start-up ecosystem in the city, has said that like-minded people have joined together to build the platform that makes it easy for people to organise hackathons. “The online platform will help the organisers send invites, fliers and alerts to the participants. It will also handhold them in various steps,” he said.

Haryana poll: Sonia hits out at PM ModiThe Hindu Congress President Sonia Gandhi and the Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda during rally at Maham,dist Rohtak,Haryana on Saturday. - Photo:Sandeep Saxena
Meham (Rohtak), Oct 4:  
In a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi today said the new government was behaving as if governments since independence have done nothing for the country and asked him what happened to his promise of bringing back black money.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence and they will change everyone’s fortunes overnight. Have any steps been taken to fulfil the promises made during the elections.
”...What happened to their promise of getting back the black money from abroad within 100 days of coming to power.
Have any steps been taken in this regard? Absolutely not,” Gandhi said at a rally here, hours after Modi urged voters in Haryana to oust the Congress.
“A country is not built in a day’s time. For the development of a nation it takes years of hard work, the right intention and the willingness to sacrifice,” she said.
Accusing Modi government of hijacking policies of previous Congress regimes, she urged the people not to get swayed by “hollow promises” and said that Congress was the only party which would ensure that development continues in Haryana.
“At the time of the elections, I urge you to take a decision after listening to your brain and not your heart. To seek votes they try to play with your emotions, may hollow promises. Beware of such designs,” the Congress President said.
“Those who lure people with their false dreams only to secure power have nothing to do with progress or people of the state,” she said.
She also accused the ruling BJP of rechristening the schemes of the UPA and presented them before people, after having criticised the same schemes during UPA regime.
Gandhi also urged people of the state to elect the Congress once again to ensure speedy progress and to take forward the development initiated by the party in the last 10 years for it to be cited as an example across the country.
“Congress is not such a party which believes in presenting others’ works as its own,” she said.
Praising the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government for ushering in all—round development in various spheres of life, she said, “In the last 10 years, Congress party has laid a strong foundation for the state’s progress and will take it forward on the path of development in the next five years...Only Congress party can do this work of initiating development.”
She also attacked the BJP and INLD for indulging in “caste politics”.

Legally weak  politically strongUpdated: October 3, 2014 09:37 IST
Legally weak, politically strong
The Hindu IN SUPPORT: Every person in the AIADMK is showing his or her loyalty to the leader. Picture shows party cadres protesting in Chennai against the conviction of Jayalalithaa. — PHOTO: B. JOTHI RAMALINGAM
TOPICS
political development
It seems unlikely that Jayalalithaa will contest the 2016 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but her political career cannot be written off
There is no substitute for demonstrable loyalty and it is an art the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has mastered. It was visible in abundant measure soon after the conviction and incarceration of its General Secretary Jayalalithaa on September 27. The crying during the oath taking of her replacement and a resolution by a city corporation against special judge John Michael Cunha who delivered the verdict, were all part of the act.
In the AIADMK, it is the season for every person to show his or her loyalty to the leader, and many bureaucrats and police officers would not want to be left behind. One such case seems to be the filing of an FIR against Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M.Karunanidhi, and his son M.K. Stalin, for charges of rioting, at the Royapettah police station in Chennai.
Fighting an old battle
While the FIR itself cannot set off alarm bells, it assumes significance in the backdrop of the virulent personal battle between the two leaders. This battle has manifested itself in “witch hunts,” such as the midnight arrest of Mr. Karunanidhi in 2001.
It is true that the disproportionate assets case, in which Jayalalithaa was convicted, was a case the DMK had worked on rigorously over the last 18 years and that her conviction and jail sentence will be celebrated by the party as a victory. The DMK is also expected to make repeated attempts at provoking the anger of the administration by celebrating the verdict and instigate retaliatory action that could help it mobilise a political campaign.
In the past, Jayalalithaa herself has been known for “outbursts.” With her administration trying to prove its loyalty to her, the real test this time is to see if she has learnt from her earlier mistakes. Any retaliatory action against her political rivals would only open her flank further and give a platform to the opposition.
In the present context, the legal situation of the AIADMK supremo must be clearly delinked from her political situation. Legally, she is on a weak wicket and will have to face a protracted and difficult court battle. Her best hope is to seek bail and a stay on the sentence from the Karnataka High Court and let the legal battle play out. At the moment it seems unlikely that she will contest the 2016 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.
Politically, however, Jayalalithaa has never been on a stronger wicket. The AIADMK’s near clean sweep victory of 37 out of 39 seats in the parliamentary elections in May, without an alliance with any party, underlined her position, leaving the opposition flabbergasted.
Unlike her earlier two terms as Chief Minister — from 1991 to 1996 and 2001 to 2006 — her third time since 2011 has been much more circumspect. She has avoided or skirted controversies better than she has done in the past while the DMK has been at its lowest ebb.
Even if she cannot contest the 2016 Assembly polls, she will be the party’s Chief Minister in spirit as the AIADMK has revolved around her and it is not in its DNA to challenge her authority. The verdict will not impact her authority, control over the party or the sycophancy it displays towards her; it may only increase all of it, despite her not holding constitutional office.
The question is whether she will be satisfied being the “remote control” — the way Bal Thackeray controlled the Shiv Sena government — and ensure that the administration runs smoothly and efficiently as she fights a long legal battle.
The DMK has its own set of land mines to cross before the 2016 State elections as the verdict in the 2G case, in which Mr. Karunanidhi’s daughter Kanimozhi is an accused, is expected. And the party is not in a position to turn Jayalalithaa’s conviction in a corruption case into a major political or electoral issue.
What lies ahead
Analysts in New Delhi seem to suggest that the Bharatiya Janata Party may scent a chance and work with its Tamil Nadu allies and take advantage. This is, at best, wishful thinking. The 2014 Lok Sabha poll results suggest that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could only split the opposition vote and add to the tally of the winning Dravidian party.
Ultimately, in politics, one fundamental rule is to never write off a politician, no matter how bleak their future may seem. This is especially true in Jayalalithaa’s case. She has managed to recover from worse situations in the past, especially after a complete rout in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections after presiding over a “blatantly corrupt” administration between 1991 and 1996.
The key this time is not so much the verdict itself or what happens in the courts, but her actions as a politician and as a “remote control” Chief Minister.

Investors Batten Down Hatches for Volatile End to 2014
Reuters | Updated On: October 03, 2014 08:51 (IST)
How Global Stock Markets Will Perform in 2015
London:
Global investors are starting to cut back on stock market positions, wary of a wave of financial market turbulence in the final quarter of 2014 as the era of cheap money ends.
The tide turned abruptly this week with the close of the third quarter and major stock markets have lurched down at the start of October, a month associated with previous market shakeouts including the 1929 and 1987 crashes.
Two weeks earlier, the benchmark S&P 500 index reached an all-time high, prompting many investors to speculate that shares were too expensive by most historical measures. Since reaching that peak on September 19, Wall Street has dropped nearly 4 per cent and many expect more volatility to come.
"The last three years have been quite good for equities but now it's going be a lot harder. Unfortunately you've now got to invest with seat-belts on... You have to accept more volatility. We expect the next six months to be very challenging," said Remi Ajewole, a multi asset fund manager at Schroders, one of Europe's largest independent investment groups.
Markets are starting to price in the US Federal Reserve calling time on the easy money policies which it brought in as economic life support after the financial crisis of 2008.
Quantitative easing, a pillar of this policy which involved the Fed buying up bonds to add liquidity to the financial system, is due to end later this month.
A second aspect, keeping official interest rates in the United States at historic lows, is also expected to end within months as the world's largest economy strengthens.
The prospect of a relative scarcity of US dollars has driven the currency higher in recent weeks. While this may seem a benign development to American consumers who see their international purchasing power increase, it is proving disruptive to financial markets.
A new period of dollar strength risks drawing American investment back home, fearful of heavy currency losses on overseas assets. This in turn can affect US corporations because it devalues their overseas earnings in dollar terms and risks making American exports less competitive.
Charles Morris, London-based head of Absolute Return at HSBC Global Asset Management, said the currency market was going through one of its phases when a decisive dollar move pushes everything else in the opposite direction.
"Every single currency is going down except the dollar which is shooting up like a rocket. It's like a water bed with a big fat man on it," he said.
Morris said he has been reducing risk before the last quarter, cutting back on equities, high yield credit and emerging market debt while adding dollar assets which he calls "the number one defensive thing you can do".
However, some investors point to a risk that the end of cheap money could affect smaller US companies.
"In the US we are very sensitive to small cap stocks. We think they were the primary beneficiary of QE and in an environment where the Fed turns off the liquidity taps, they could struggle," Ajewole said, adding that while her Schroders team still regards stocks as "a good asset class", she has reduced exposure.
A Reuters poll of investment managers around the world published on September 30 found a sense of caution manifested in people putting their biggest bets since March on bonds, which are typically regarded as a shelter against market volatility.
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE
Some investors nonetheless say the overall economic outlook remains benign. The Fed raising interest rates is a symptom of robust economic growth, they say, even if it carries risks.
Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities, said heavy appetite from pension funds and other institutions for credit means corporate bond sales will remain robust even if interest rates rise a bit. That will help underpin stock markets.
"What we're going through now is a short-term panicky selloff and when it runs its course the credit boom will resume," he said.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is going in an opposite direction with easier monetary policy aimed at jump-starting a moribund economy. The Reuters poll found Europeans raising equity exposure, partly on account of optimism for corporate earnings if European companies get access to cheap money.
"For the remainder of the year we expect higher volatility in markets, but still prefer equities over other asset classes," said Boris Willems, a strategist at UBS Global Asset Management.
"Monetary policy overall continues to be accommodative, in spite of some policy divergence over the coming months and years... The OECD (developed) economies remain in expansion."
The VIX index of volatility, known as "the fear index", sits at around 17, up nearly 50 per cent since the end of August. However, it remains about 80 per cent below the peak reached in the crisis year of 2008 after swinging between 20 and around 47 through the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Andrew Milligan, Head of Global Strategy at British fund manager Standard Life Investments, says the rise in volatility belies what should be seen as an opportunity to snap up good stocks on the cheap.
"The underlying trend in corporate cash flow remains positive. The only reason that the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in 2015 is because the US economy would be strong enough, demonstrating tighter labour markets and thus reassuring investors that policy tightening is needed to ensure the recovery is long-lasting," he said.

Simplifying Procedures Under New Companies Law, Says Ministry

Government to Streamline Subsidies, Cheap LPG for Rich May Go: Finance Minister
New Delhi:
Making efforts to ensure smooth implementation of the new companies law, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs is working on simplifying procedures by way of notifications and circulars.
The Companies Act, 2013 -- that replaces the nearly six-decade old law governing corporates in the country - came into effect from April 1.
Many stakeholders have raised concerns about certain aspects of the new Act and the Ministry -- which is implementing this law -- is taking steps to address the issues.
Corporate Affairs Secretary Naved Masood has said the Ministry is open to suggestions and feedback in understanding corporate needs.
"The Ministry is continuously working on simplifying procedures for smooth implementation of the new Companies Act, by issuing several notifications, and circulars on relevant provisions of the Act," Masood has written in the latest issue of the Ministry's monthly newsletter.
In recent weeks, the Ministry has come out with various circulars and notifications, including those related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) under the new Act.
Earlier in August, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs Nirmala Sitharaman had said that amendments to the new Act might not even be necessary if stakeholders feel relieved with changes being made in the rules.
In July, the government had told Parliament that amendments to the Companies Act would be considered only if statutory orders and changes to rules do not address the practical difficulties in implementing the legislation.

Efforts Will be Made to Ease Fuel Crisis at Power Plants: Coal MinistryIntroduce 'Jan Bima Yojna' for Insurance: IRDA to Government
New Delhi: With the Supreme Court clearing the air with regard to coal blocks, the Coal Ministry has said it will make efforts to ensure that the fuel is made available for electricity generation and the crisis at power plants is eased.
Coal stock position at thermal power plants is critical as more than half of the generating stations have less than a week's fuel stock.
"The government is relieved that the Supreme Court has cleared the air in regard to cancellation of 218 coal blocks.... The government will move in the right earnest in this behalf and will attempt to ensure the coal is made available for production of power so that the power crisis in the country is eased," a Coal Ministry document said.
It further said that it is keen to move forward in the matter of allocating the coal blocks which stand reverted to the government.
"The government appreciates the gesture of the court in granting six months' time to the allottees as also to the Government to complete the process of fresh allocation. The Government is conscious of its obligations and responsibilities to ensure maximum coal production for the needs of the country," it said.
In a major blow to the corporate sector, the Supreme Court on September 24 quashed allocation of 214 out of 218 coal blocks allotted to various companies since 1993 terming it as "fatally flawed" and allowed the Centre to take over operation of 42 such blocks which are functional.
The apex court has said the beneficiaries of the illegal process "must suffer" the consequences and refused to show sympathy to private companies which submitted that Rs 2.87 lakh crore had been invested in 157 coal blocks and Rs 4 lakh crore in end-use plants.

MFs Buy Over Rs. 4 000-Crore Shares in SeptemberYou are here: Home Market
Mutual Funds Buy Shares Worth Over Rs 4,000 Crore in September
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 03, 2014 13:49 (IST)
How Global Stock Markets Will Perform in 2015
New Delhi:
Improved market sentiment helped mutual funds pick up shares worth more than Rs 4,000 crore in September, making it the fifth consecutive monthly inflow.
Besides, they pumped in a staggering over Rs 23,000 crore in the debt market during the period.
The inflow in equities during the month followed net investment of close to Rs 6,000 crore in August, Rs 5,000 crore in July, Rs 3,340 crore in June and Rs 105 crore in May.
Prior to that, fund houses have been net sellers in the equity market since September last year, while they were net buyers of shares to the tune of Rs 1,607 crore in August 2013.
As per the latest data compiled by market regulator Sebi, Mutual Funds (MFs) purchased shares worth Rs 4,171 crore last month.
Industry experts attributed the inflows in equities to improvement in market sentiments, primarily due to the new government's reforms agenda.
Besides, retail participation in equity schemes has increased significantly in the last few months.
"The money in equities has been coming in the past few months and mostly in the second half of May after the General Election results," said a market expert.
Mutual funds collect money from investors and buy stocks, including IPOs (primary market) and bonds.
In the first eight months of 2014, MFs purchased shares worth over Rs 8,000 crore, while they pumped in a staggering Rs 4.6 lakh crore in the debt market.
MFs offloaded shares worth Rs 14,208 crore last fiscal, lower than Rs 22,749 crore offloaded in 2012-13.
The financial year ended March 31, 2014 also marked the fifth consecutive year of net outflows by mutual funds in the equities after pumping in a net amount of Rs 6,985 crore in the share market in 2008-09.

Oil Ministry Sets Up Panel on Delays in ONGC Gas Discovery
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 03, 2014 23:36 (IST)
Dr Reddy's Launches Docetaxel Injection in US
New Delhi: The Petroleum Ministry has set up a committee headed by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) to inquire into the reasons for delay in developing gas discoveries in ONGC's Krishna Godavari basin KG-D5 block.
The three-member committee will be headed by B N Talukar, Director General of the DGH, and will have the financial advisor and a director from the ministry. It will inquire into delay in developing fields by Oil and Natural Gas Corp in the block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, and submit its report by end-October, sources said.
ONGC's KG-D5 sits next to Reliance Industries Ltd's eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal. Both blocks were awarded in the first round of auction under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 2000.
While RIL began oil production from its KG-D6 block in September 2008 and gas output in April 2009, ONGC, which has made 11 oil and gas discoveries in KG-D5 block, is at least four years away from first gas.
The ministry now wants to investigate the reasons for the delay.
ONGC chairman and managing director Dinesh K Sarraf welcomed constitution of the committee and said the company will extend all cooperation in the investigation.
He said gas production from the block is planned to begin in 2018 and oil output in 2019.
KG-D5 will produce up to 90,000 barrels per day (4.5 million tonnes per annum) - the largest from any field on the east coast. ONGC will produce 17 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the block.
"We plan to put to production discoveries in northern part of the block together with finds in a neighbouring block," he said, adding that the company is working on a field development plan which will detail investment required.
KG-D5 is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA).
NDA holds an estimated 92.30 million tonnes of oil reserves and 97.568 billion cubic metres of inplace gas reserves spread over seven fields.
ONGC bought 90 per cent interest in Block KG-DWN-98/2 from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn subsequently relinquished its remaining 10 per cent interest in favour of ONGC.
Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area - Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna).
Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries - E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1 and KT-1 in NDA and the first ultra- deep water discovery UD-1 at a record depth of 2,841 metres.
The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U, A, while the ultra deep sea UD find lies in SDA.

In Dallas  Ebola-infected items finally removed in an effort to ease tensionsBy Abby Phillip October 3 Follow @abbydphillip
A hazardous-materials crew arrived Friday to collect bed sheets and towels at a Texas apartment where a man diagnosed with the Ebola virus stayed before he was hospitalized. (AP)
DALLAS — A mattress, soiled linens, a suitcase and clothing all touched by Thomas Duncan, the man who contracted Ebola, are finally being removed from the Texas apartment where they have been left for days.
Hazardous materials crews began removing the items in large waste drums Friday afternoon in northeast Dallas as the family Duncan had traveled from Liberia to visit waited in another room.
"They are in good spirits," said Dallas County Fire Marshall Robert Delossantos.
Health officials are closely monitoring the people living in that apartment for signs that they might have contracted Ebola while Duncan was sick in the home. So far, they have not reported any symptoms, Dallas officials said.
Four people — Louise Troh, the woman Duncan was visiting; her son, Timothy Wayne; and two men in their 20s, Oliver Smallwood and Jeffrey Cole — have been ordered to remain in the apartment at least until Oct. 19, after the 21-day incubation period for the virus has passed.
As soon as Friday, they will be moved from that apartment and placed in another secure location for the duration of the incubation period, Dallas officials said.
The infected items will be removed from the apartment and transported to a secure storage location before they are destroyed, the fire marshal said.
“It is not so much a concern that we need to get her out of here because it’s dangerous or anything like that,” said Sana Syed, the public information officer for the City of Dallas. Troh, she said, "is scared. People in this complex are scared.”
Duncan stayed at the Ivy Apartments complex, which is part of a broader community known as Vickery — a diverse melting pot of immigrants, ethnic groups and languages.
Neighbors have peered from their windows and looked on from their porches as throngs of media surrounded the gated community since Tuesday.
Fears abound in this Dallas community.
“There are people here who are going to work today and they are being turned away because employers don’t want to be near people who live in the area around where patient zero resided,” Syed said.
One mother, Apolonea Catalan, said she was too scared to let her daughter go to school Thursday at Sam Tasby Middle School, which is just around the corner from the Ivy Apartments. She reluctantly relented Friday.
Five children are believed to have had contact with Duncan while he was symptomatic and contagious. Two attended Tasby Middle School.
Mai Do, a neighbor who lives across the street from the Ivy apartments, said she is filled with fear for her own family’s safety — and worry for the health of the family across the street.
Do’s two sons, a 13-year-old and 8-year-old, attend schools with children who had contact with Duncan.
“I’m scared but my husband told me don’t worry about it,” she said. “I would like to keep them at home at this time.”
She instructed them to not share food, or touch their classmates until this is all over.
"I pray every day for Thomas Duncan, for the children, and everyone,” she added.

Islamic State beheads another British hostage  releases videoOct 04, 2014 at 06:56am IST
Islamic State beheads another British hostage, releases video
17
3
Cairo: An Internet video released on Friday purports to show an Islamic State group fighter beheading British hostage Alan Henning, the fourth such killing carried out by the extremist group now targeted in US-led airstrikes.
The video mirrored other beheading videos shot by the Islamic State group, which now holds territory along the border of Syria and Iraq, and ended with a militant threatening a man they identified as an American named Peter Kassig.
"Obama, you have started your aerial bombardment of Shams (Syria), which keeps on striking our people, so it is only right that we continue to strike the neck of your people," the masked militant in the video said.
The video mirrored other beheading videos shot by the Islamic State group.
#islamic state #syria #british #obama
National Security Council Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden confirmed that Kassig was being held by Islamic State militants, in a statement issued on Friday evening.
"At this point we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video released earlier today. We will continue to use every tool at our disposal -- military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence - to try to bring Peter home to his family," Hayden said.
The Associated Press could not immediately verify the video's authenticity, though it was released in the same manner as other Islamic State group videos and the masked militant sounded similar to the one who carried out the other slayings.
In a statement, the British Foreign Office said it was working to verify the video.
"If true, this is a further disgusting murder," the statement read. "We are offering the family every support possible; they ask to be left alone at this time."
Britain has been supporting U.S. military efforts against the Islamic State group by using British forces to help with logistics and intelligence gathering, as well as recently taking part in airstrikes in Iraq. The Internet video released on Friday begins with a news clip announcing British strikes against the Islamic State group.
British Prime Minister David Cameron said Henning's apparent slaying showed "how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are."
"Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need," Cameron said in a statement. "The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these ... terrorists.
"We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice."
President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, said the U.S. had seen the video and was evaluating it.
Later, Obama said the United States strongly condemned Henning's "brutal murder." He said the U.S., along with Britain and other allies, will "work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder" to justice and will continue to "taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic State group.
French President Francois Hollande said he is "outraged by the heinous crime."
"This crime like previous ones will not be unpunished. France will continue to lend support to the people and authorities of Iraq in their fight against terrorism," Hollande said in a statement.
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group. The full beheadings are not shown in the videos, but the British-accented, English-speaking militant holds a long knife and appears to begin cutting his victims, who include American reporter James Foley, American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and now Henning.
FBI Director James Comey has said American officials believe they know the identity of the masked militant, though he's declined to name the man or reveal his nationality.
Kassig, a 26 year-old American now threatened by the Islamic State group, enlisted in the Army in 2004, and became a Ranger, ultimately serving in the 75th Ranger Regiment, an Army special operations unit.
According to his military record, Kassig trained at Fort Benning, Georgia in 2006, and deployed to Iraq from April to July 2007. He was medically discharged at the rank of private first class in September 2007. His home of record at the time of his enlistment was Indianapolis, Indiana.
His parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, issued a statement through a media relations firm, asking for the world to pray for their son.
"The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning. We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration," the statement said. "We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe."
The family said Kassig had been working for the relief organization SERA when he was captured on Oct. 1, 2013 on his way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria. He converted to Islam while in captivity and the family has heard from former hostages that his faith has provided him comfort.
Henning, 47, nicknamed "Gadget," had joined an aid convoy and was taken captive on Dec. 26, shortly after crossing the border between Turkey and Syria. Earlier this week, Henning's wife Barbara Henning asked the militants in a televised plea: "Please release him. We need him back home."
Dozens of Muslim leaders in Britain have urged the Islamic State group to release Henning. His wife had said she had been given hope by "the outcry across the world" over her husband's imprisonment.
Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Henning "a British hero."
His "barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world," Shafiq said.
The Islamic State group has its roots in al-Qaida's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody 3-year civil war in neighboring Syria, growing stronger to the point of being able to launch a lightning offensive across much of northern Iraq, routing security forces there and shooting down an Iraqi helicopter on Friday. The group has become known for filming and releasing footage of mass shootings it conducts, as well as beheading opponents and targeting religious and ethnic minorities in the areas it attacks.
The extremist group has been widely denounced by mainstream Muslim authorities.
Other foreigners are believed held by the Islamic State group. On Friday, the father of John Cantlie, a British photojournalist held by the group, appealed for his release in a video, saying he was a friend of Syria.

Poor-rich gap growing in India  Asia-Pacific: United Nations34
0
New Delhi: The gap between the poor and the rich is growing in the Asia-Pacific region and there has been an increase in income inequality in many major economies including India, China and Indonesia, a UN-ESCAP report has said.
"Inequality is key socio-economic challenge for the region. At the national level, there has been an increase in income inequality in many major economies in recent decades," said the report of United Nations - Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific.
"Widening income gaps across societies and within communities are the consequence of a series of factors," it added. The Gini coefficient - a measure of income inequality - between early 1990s and late 2000s increased from 30.8 to 33.9 in India; 32.4 to 42.1 in China and in Indonesia it increased from 29.2 to 38.1, the report said.
"Inequality is key socio-economic challenge for India, China and Indonesia," a UN-ESCAP report has said.
#unescap #un #india #china
However, during the same period the coefficient decreased in countries such as Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand and Uzbekistan. Weaker labour market institutions, inadequate social protection systems, poor-quality education, inadequate access to credit and land and excessive asset concentration are among the factors for widening income gaps, the report said.
"The gap between rich and poor is widespread in the region and continuing to grow in many countries the poorest 20 per cent of the population accounts for less than 10 per cent of national income," it said. UN-ESCAP conducted the study for about 40 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
The ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) in the regions shows that persons with a net worth of USD 30 million or more accounted for 30 per cent of the region's income in 2012-13, the report said.
"This shows that wealth concentration is a major characteristic of income inequality. The region had around 49,000 persons (0.001 per cent of Asia-Pacific population in 2013) classed as UHNWIs, with about USD 7.5 trillion of net wealth in 2012-13," it added.
The wide gap in national income held by the ultra-rich and the poor is striking, the report said. "It has been observed that the wealth-income ratio is rising due to the growing share of capital in national income, which is further exacerbating the inequality gap between the top 1 per cent of the population and the poorest 20 per cent."
In addition to vertical inequality among individuals, there have also been widening horizontal disparities, especially between rural and urban areas, as well as between coastal regions and the interior.
"This is particularly worrying for large multiracial countries with significant regional variations, since it can trigger social and political instability," the report added.

ISIS releases another video  shows killing of British hostageISIS releases another video, shows killing of British hostage
Agencies | Cairo Oct 04, 2014 03:25 AM IST
The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on Friday released a video showing the purported beheading of British hostage Alan Henning and threatening yet another American captive. This is fourth such killing carried out by the extremist group now targeted in US-led airstrikes.
Henning, a 47-year-old from Manchester in northwest England who volunteered to help drive an aid convoy to Syria for Muslim charity Aid4Syria, was kidnapped 10 months ago.
The video released yesterday mirrored earlier ones that ISIS put out, and ends with an Islamic State fighter threatening a man they identified as an American named Peter Kassig..
The video, which emerged yesterday, shows Henning on his knees against a desert backdrop and wearing an orange prison-style outfit, with a masked militant standing over him wielding a combat knife before the video cut to his beheading.
"Obama, you have started your aerial bombardment of Shams (Syria), which keeps on striking our people, so it is only right that we continue to strike the neck of your people," the masked militant said.
 
The Associated Press could not immediately verify the video's authenticity, though it was released in the same manner as other ISIS group videos and the masked militant sounded similar to the one who carried out the other slayings.
British Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed waht he called the "brutal murder" of aid worker Alan Henning by the Islamic State group and vowed to bring his killers to justice.
 
"The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL (another term for ISIS) shows just how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are," Cameron said in a statement.
 
"We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice," Cameron said, adding that the fact that Henning was captured and killed while trying to help others "demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these ... terrorists".
 
A US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concerns of not having permission to release the information, confirmed that Peter Kassig is being held by Islamic State militants. The official declined to elaborate.
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group. The full beheadings are not shown in the videos, but the British-accented, English-speaking militant holds a long knife and appears to begin cutting the three men, American reporters James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.

NEW DELHI: The government is revamping the crude import policy to leverage the shifting sands of global oil market as new players gnaw at the existing world order of suppliers amid tepid demand.
At present, Indian state-run refiners buy crude under term contract directly from national oil companies (NOCs) as well as a select band of global majors that have a share in oil from fields operated by them around the world.
Crude is bought on the basis of an 'official selling price (OSP)' declared by some of the NOCs, while it is negotiated with some. The emphasis on term contracts remains as strong as ever but procedural problems have arisen as NOCs have changed the way of doing business. Many of them now sell crude through subsidiaries with the aim of extracting higher price as refineries become more sensitive to various grades of oil.
There has also been a shakeout among the global majors due to mergers, while some others have lost significance or have been eased out by new entrants.
These changes have a direct bearing on the decision making process of the state-run refiners who face delays in seeking clarifications and approvals from the government. The policy changes propose to cut red tape and time by laying down clear criteria for qualifying a seller as an NOC or its subsidiary, swapping of a particular grade of oil between NOCs and MNCs and pricing of grades not available on OSP. The list of MNCs is also to be updated in line with current Fortune and Platts rankings.
Oil ministry sources said the existing system for buying crude was put in place in 1979 with the establishment of an Empowered Standing Committee to approve contracts. Indian Oil was the sole importer and also supplied crude to Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum .
The committee's composition underwent changes in 1981 and in 2002 when separate panels were set up for BPCL and HPCL as crude import was deregulated. In 2003, another panel was formed for MRPL, which had by then been taken over by ONGC .These changes are now proving to be inadequate in the complex trade dynamics of the global oil market.

Stanford professor Thomas Kailath wins US National Medal of ScienceStanford professor Thomas Kailath wins US National Medal of Science
IANS | Washington Oct 04, 2014 09:02 AM IST
Thomas Kailath, professor of engineering at Stanford University, is one of the recipients of the prestigious US National Medal of Science announced Friday by President Barack Obama.
Kailath is also a recipient of the Padma Bhushan, one of India's highest civilian awards and is a member of leading science and engineering academies in India.
He received his BE (Telecom) degree from the College of Engineering, Pune before getting his SM and ScD degrees in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston.
He then worked at the Jet Propulsion Labs in Pasadena, California, before joining Stanford University as associate professor of Electrical Engineering in 1963.
Kailath's research and teaching at Stanford has ranged across several fields of engineering and mathematics, with a different focus roughly every decade, according to his profile on the university website.
These included information theory, communications, linear systems, estimation and control, signal processing, semiconductor manufacturing, probability and statistics, and matrix and operator theory.
Kailath became a full professor in 1968, and was appointed the first holder of the Hitachi America Professorship in 1988. He assumed emeritus status in 2001, but remains active with his research and writing activities.
Kailath is a Fellow of the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), an organisation for engineering professionals, and has received the IEEE Medal of Honor in 2007 for contributions to the development of powerful algorithms for communications, control, computing and signal processing.
Among his other major honours are the Shannon Award of the IEEE Information Theory Society; the IEEE Education Medal and the IEEE Signal Processing Medal; Guggenheim, Churchill and Humboldt Fellowships.
He is also a member of the US National Academy of Engineering, the US National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and foreign member of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Spanish Academy of Engineering.
Obama also announced recipients of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. The new awardees will receive their medals at a White House ceremony later this year.
"These scholars and innovators have expanded our understanding of the world, made invaluable contributions to their fields, and helped improve countless lives," Obama said, according to a White House announcement.
"Our nation has been enriched by their achievements, and by all the scientists and technologists across America dedicated to discovery, inquiry, and invention," he said.

Patna district administration deny lapses  says tragedy result ofsuffocationPress Trust of India | Patna | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:24 pm
Facing flak for the stampede at Gandhi Maidan that left 33 dead and 29 injured, Patna district administration on Saturday denied lapses and said the tragedy “seems to be result of suffocation” due to the huge gathering of people for Dusshera celebrations.
“People appear to have died due to suffocation,” District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma told reporters at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj echoing him attributed the tragedy to ‘asphyxiation’.
“CCTV footage shows movement of a huge mass of people and there is no clear picture of stampede visible in the footage the incident (the deaths) seems to have happened due to suffocation,” he said.
“Some people are seen falling and others picking them up, light was dim as the high mast light was not functioning near Ramgulam chowk… CCTV footage due to poor light is not conclusive,” the SSP told a press conference at the PMCH principal’s chamber.
He denied lathicharge by police, which eyewitnesses alleged triggered the stampede and at the same time did not rule out the role of rumours as part of a ‘conspiracy’ behind the tragedy.
Some people are being questioned in this respect and the police was in the process of registering an FIR in the incident. “We are also checking how far the falling of an electric wire or a ditch in which the feet of some people were trapped caused panic among crowd are true,” Maharaj said.
Verma dismissed allegations that the gates of GandhiMaidan was kept closed, except for the one that opened near Ramgulam chowk. “Gates were not closed. All the four gates including the one for VIPs were open… This can be seen in CCTV footage which cannot lie,” he asserted.
Asked about the poor light condition in Gandhi maidan, the DM said lighting arrangement was the responsibility of the Puja committee. He said some lights were functional while some others were not working.
Meanwhile, Principal Secretary (home) Amir Subhani and Additional Director General of Police (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey, who have been asked by the state government to probe the stampede, visited the spot.
“We have come here as part of the probe,” Subhani told reporters. The two top officials saw a ditch under the iron gate that opened on the side of Ramgulam chowk. They also saw some iron rods of the cover on the ditch were uprooted. Some eyewitnesses had claimed that the feet of some people were trapped in it causing panic among crowd. Pandey said they would host an open session at the collectorate on October 7 in which people could depose before the probe team.

Pak troops target Jammu villages; truce violation inGulmargThe Army said there was also a brief ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC) in Gulmarg sector of north Kashmir last night.
Press Trust of India | Jammu/srinagar | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:09 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 3:28 pm
After shelling border hamlets along the LoC in Poonch, Pakistani troops resorted to heavy firing of mortar bombs, small and automatic weapons in Jammu region overnight leaving two persons injured.
The Army said there was also a brief ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC) in Gulmarg sector of north Kashmir last night.
“Pakistani Rangers resorted to firing and shelling of mortar bombs targeting border hamlets and Border Out Posts (BoPs) along the International Border in R S Pura belt of Jammu district since last night”, a police officer said today.
In the firing and shelling, four BoPs and Channa, Kako De Kothay, Kodwal and Devigarh villages were hit. Two persons were injured in Kako-De-Kothay village, officer said.
Seven houses suffered partial damage in the firing, the officer said.
BSF troops guarding the border took position and fired back resulting in exchanges which continued till midnight.
This is the seventh ceasefire violation in the past four days by Pakistani troops along LoC and IB in Poonch and Jammu districts since October one. There have been four ceasefire violations along LoC in Poonch and the along IB in Jammu.
One girl was killed and 10 people injured in firing and mortar shelling along LoC in Sabjian forward belt of Poonch district in the past three days.
In Srinagar, General Officer Commanding of Srinagar-based 15 Corps Lt Gen Subrata Saha told reporters today that there was a brief ceasefire violation along the LoC in Gulmarg sector of north Kashmir.
“On the intervening night of September 30 and October 1, the first ceasefire violation took place in Poonch sector.
Yesterday, it was in the south of Gulmarg as well.The effects were more pronounced on the Poonch side.It was very much there on our side but comparatively not significant,” he said.
Lt Gen Saha said the Army was studying the pattern of the frequent ceasefire violations and it was premature to say if there was any design behind it.
“Basically, we are still studying the things. Yesterday’s firing lasted for around four hours. It was not absolutely continuous but intermittent. The highest caliber that we could make out from the bombs lying on the Poonch side was a 120 mm bomb. We are analysing it, we are trying to see where does it fit in the larger picture,” he said.
He said Army responded to the ceasefire violations in an appropriate manner and has taken up the matter at various levels.
“Whenever there has been any such ceasefire violation, they have been responded to appropriately, both in terms of the response on the ground along the LoC and also putting it across as far as ceasefire agreements or shall we say ceasefire understanding are concerned.
“We have been sending the continued…

Army salutes youths for support in flood rescueoperationsPress Trust of India | Srinagar | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:04 pm
Army Saturday “saluted” the efforts put in by the youth of Kashmir Valley during the devastating floods and said if it were not for the young men, the force would not have been able to effectively accomplish the mission of rescuing people.
“Probably, it is my men on the ground who have actually seen how effective and how important the role of the youth was. Every second or third boat of mine went to the local volunteers. If it was not for these local youths, who had guided us to reach the places, I cannot say how we would have been able to accomplish the mission,” General Officer Commanding of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps Lt Gen Subrata Saha told reporters here.
“As far as the Army is concerned, it salutes the efforts put in by the youth, (both) with us and also by themselves. We are deeply conscious because we have seen it with our own eyes.
“My own officers and men have conveyed this to me at various forums at all places and they all had lots of tales to tell of the great, great efforts of the youth,” he said.
Lt Gen Saha said the people of the Valley deserve all the respect and admiration for what they did during the floods.
“On so many occasions, when boats reached (submerged) houses, the inhabitants of particular house said ‘no, not me, please go to the neighbour’s house, they need it more than I do’.
The people, the youth, they all have my respect and admiration for what they have done,” he said.
The Commander, while commenting on a controversy surrounding the portrayal of Army in a recent movie, said art must have its own place.
“Honestly, I do not have time to watch movies. As a matter of principle, art is an expression and it must have its own place,” he said.

PM Narendra Modi slams Congress, seeks clear mandate for Haryana's development
PTI Oct 4, 2014, 01.26PM IST

Congress
(Attacking the ruling Congress…)
KARNAL (HARYANA): Continuing his Lok Sabha plank of ousting the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today sought a clear mandate for the BJP in Haryana for putting the state on a growth trajectory.
Kicking off his party's poll campaign in Haryana, he hit out at the Congress for the state's backwardness.
Modi said that today the entire world was looking at India with greater respect and this had happened not because of him, but the power of 125 crore people of India, who had formed a strong and stable government at the Centre.
"Why has India's pride increased today? It is not because of Modi, it is because 125 crore people of India have formed a stable and strong government in Delhi. This is your magic not Modi's magic. Do you want that Haryana's name also echo around the world."
"Its first condition is that there should be 'Congress mukt Haryana'. The second that a stable government with full majority should be formed. And third, there should be a government which lets Modi work in Haryana," he said.
Attacking the ruling Congress in the state, Modi said that those who could not do anything for the last 60 years were now asking for his record in 60 days.
"The people who could not do anything in 60 years, they are asking for my 60 day record," he said.
In his 30-minute address at a rally here, Modi, while describing the ruling Congress as "anti-farmer", was also critical of the party's claim that Haryana was No 1 State.
He said the state lagged behind in several parameters including literacy rate, per capita income, poverty alleviation, health, education, among others.
Modi also launched a veiled attack on main opposition INLD, asking the people whether they would like the State being governed from jail.
INLD President and former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala has been sentenced in the teachers recruitment scam.
Chautala, who is out on bail on health grounds, had said that he would take oath as the next CM from Tihar Jail.
Seeking to connect with the farmers of the state, Modi hit out at the Congress for stating that the Centre had imposed ban on Basmati rice export.
"I am surprised that is it necessary to speak lies in polls. I do not need to tell, but you know all my farmer brother and sisters are being misled, you are being told that Centre has imposed a ban on Basmati rice export, which is 100 per cent lies and injustice to the farmers," he said.
Modi said Haryana was levying four per cent tax which was fetching lesser price for Basmati growers.
Launching a scathing attack on the Congress over alleged land scams, Modi said thousands of acres of land had vanished and farmers were deprived of adequate compensation.
"Who has taken these lands, I want to ask you did you get compensation for your land. Where has the thousands of acres of land have gone, who has taken it," he said.
"Who is anti-farmer, you have to decide. We have to change this, for this I want a clear mandate in Haryana, make our candidates victorious...,"
 
At the outset, Modi sought to strike an emotional chord with the people, saying he had come to Haryana to campaign, a day after the Vijay Dashmi festival was celebrated.
He said Haryana was the land of "Daanveer Karan", the land on which the Mahabharata battle was fought and holy Gita's message was delivered.
"This election will decide Haryana's future. I am sitting in your neighbourhood (Delhi)," Modi said.
Recalling the days he used to work in the State as a partyman, Modi said he wanted to repay the debt as he had received love and affection from the people here.
He told the people if they wanted employment, overall progress, development in villages, in cities, then change in Haryana was necessary.
"Do you want that I should serve you, I want your blessings for that and government with absolute majority, give me an opportunity to undertake development," he said.
Talking about the new route for Kailash Mansarovar yatra, he said the route existed even when Congress was in power but they had failed to do anything.
"Kailash Mansarovar was there when Congress government was there. But going there was very difficult. The work which Congress could not do, we did it in such a short time....we managed to make China understand and opened a second road to visit Kailash Mansoravar. And now one can visit Kailash Mansarovar by road," he said.
Modi also touched upon a number of schemes initiated by the Centre including Jan Dhan scheme.
Elections to the 90-member Haryana Assembly will be held on October 15.
Haryana is set to witness a multi-corner contest with key players Congress, BJP, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP), BSP, Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC)-Jan Chetna Manch (JCM) alliance all set to cross swords.
In the last Assembly elections, Congress had won 40 seats, INLD 31, BJP 4, HJC-BL 6, SAD and BSP one each and seven seats had gone to Independents.

Maharashtra elections: Amit Shah promotes Pankaja Munde  calls her future OBC leader9
0
BJP President Amit Shah in a strategic move, announced on Saturday that 52 per cent of the OBC community should unite under the leadership of Pankaja Munde-Palave, daughter of BJP leader late Gopinath Munde, who during his lifetime had launched a massive Sangharsh Yatra all over the state against the 15 years rule of the Congress-NCP government.
Shah kicked off the election campaign from Bhagwad Garh, the holy place of Bhagwan Baba and urged the 'Vanjari', a dominant OBC caste, to unite and told them that Prime Minister Narendra Modi also belongs to the 'other backward class'. He emphasized that it is an important policy of the government to work towards the welfare of such communities and involve them in the main stream politics.
Another prominent OBC leader Mahadeo Jankar also stressed the need to make Pankja Munde the Chief Minister of Maharashtra considering the fact that the OBCs would be a major vote bank of the BJP in the forthcoming elections. The large number of audience, which became emotional after listening to the last speech of Gopinath Munde and the inspiring words of Pankaja, started demanding that his daughter should be made the next Chief Minister.
Shah kicked off the election campaign from Bhagwad Garh and urged the 'Vanjari', a dominant OBC caste, to unite.
#maharashtra #maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #pankaja munde #gopinath munde
Amit Shah remarked that he could not make any political announcement from such a religious place, but his reply was positive to the public demand. "I know very well what you people have in your minds. I am sure that party would give a major responsibility to her," he said.
Starting the election propaganda from Bhagwan Garh itself was a very intelligent move of the BJP. In fact, BJP wants to fill-up the vacuum of the OBC leader in the party after the tragic death of Gopinath Munde. Munde had announced from the same Bhagwan Garh before his death that Pankaja would be his political successor and Amit Shah also made the statement that Pankaja will be the chief leader of OBCs in future. Shah pointed out that the Prime Minister had entrusted the late BJP leader with the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Ministry.
In a powerful speech, Pankaja pointed out that she will make all the efforts to fulfill the dreams of her father Gopinath Munde whom the fate snatched away from her. She stated that her every move will be like that of the Bishop (elephant) in the chess, who moves straight crushing the opponents without caring what happens in the surrounding. She has received good backing with the support of a large number of OBCs who earlier were strong supporters of her late father for a long time.
Amit Shah, while appreciating Pankaja publicly announced that the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi would come to the Bhagwan Garh to fulfill one of Munde's last wishes. Shah was in Beed on Friday to make the review of the arrangements made for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first speech in Beed where the BJP has organsed one of the 22 big public meetings in the Maharashtra assembly elections.

The company also acquired the non-oncology business of Dabur Pharma in 2007. And the company has been expanding since.
VIDEO: CFOs should have indepth knowledge of business of company: Raj Kumar Baheti
"From 2010 onwards, we started reaping the benefits of these initiatives and we started repaying debt aggressively," says Raj Kumar Baheti, CFO, Alembic Pharma,  who has been with the Baroda-based company for more than a decade. The company reduced its debt to Rs 186.78 crore in 2012/13. Its debt/equity ratio dropped to a healthy 0.37, compared with 1.21 in 2009/10.
The CFO's role is crucial in ensuring that a company utilises debt smartly, says Baheti. Alembic is much better placed now than it was ten years ago, he adds. The company currently operates in more than 75 countries. 
"We're looking at investing more into niche research and complex products and therapies," says Baheti.
While the company's internal accruals are healthy , it may look at raising debt again in the future.
"You shouldn't borrow just for the sake of borrowing, we are conscious of the fact that we have the ability to leverage," sums up Baheti.

film festival
The ongoing Russian film festival in the city brings out the cultural ethos of a communist country
Films on mother-son relationship are not new to Tamil audiences. From Bollywood’s Mother India to Kollywood’s Sivagamiyin Selvan, these films have captured the emotional battle to perfection. But Vsevolod Pudovkin’s Russian film The Mother, that kick started the four-day screening of films based on Russian literature differed from the usual.
The film portrays a woman’s struggle against the autocrats to free her son, who is sentenced to heavy labour in a prison camp, during the 1905 Russian revolution. She joins the revolutionaries. Finally both the mother and the son get killed in the conflict.
Based on Maxim Gorky’s 1906 novel The Mother, silent movie made in 1926 depicts in detail the working class uprising against the Czars.
“The 89-minute film underwent restoration in 1968 in the Mosfilm studio and a sound track was mixed with music by Tikhon Khrennikov,” says R.S. Rajan of Yadharthaa that has organised the festival in collaboration with the Russian Coordination Council, Thiruvananthapuram, Federation of Film Societies of India, Hyderabad and MUTA (Madurai Kamaraj, Manonmaniam Sundaranar, Mother Teresa and Alagappa University Teachers' Association). It tries to bring in the different aspects of screen adaptations of Russian literature from novels to fairy tales.
“This film assumes significance as it is one of the few films that did justice to the novel,” points out Tamil professor Periasamy Raja. As a reader, he feels he did not miss much in the movie. The director, he says, maintained the intensity without shifting his attention from the focal point in the novel. The episodes involving Pavel Vlasov, the son, and his lady love in the novel are, however, not elaborately dealt with in the movie, he adds.
“I read the Tamil translation, ‘Thaai’ long back. The image of Pavel turning back to have a look at his mother while being taken to prison is most disturbing,” says theatre expert Mu. Ramasamy.
Pudovkin is also known for his editing techniques. He is a pioneer in using montages to portray complex ideas. Especially, in the scenes where he shows a prison riot and intercuts it with shots of disintegrating ice on a river. “Apart from the aesthetics of film making, the movie also carries a social message. It talks about the individual’s responsibility,” says Rajan.
The festival also featured Love (1927), based on Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina and directed by Edmund Golding. “It is an American version of the novel with significant changes. It had two different endings, a happy one for the American audience,” says Rajan.
Film adaptations of works of Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevksy, Nikloi Gogol, Maxim Gorky, Alexander Pushkin, Anton Chekhov, Vladimir Nabokov, Ivan Turgenev and Mikhail Bulgakov will be showcased during the next two days. Every screening will be followed by a discussion moderated by resource persons.
In all 27 films are being screened including 13 films by Russian directors. On the last day of the festival a seminar on ‘Nuances of film making from literature’ will be organised.

Why GE Ventures opened a Chicago office  and what it s doing here0
Q. When did GE Ventures’ interest in advanced manufacturing start, and why?
A. This office in Chicago focused on strategic venture investing and advanced manufacturing has been around for five months. We’re partnered with our global research center, and focus on external technologies, new business models, and we work with a licensing and marketing group as well.
Advanced manufacturing is in some sense a cycle. Design a product, make the product, service the product and then decommission and start the next generation of the product. Ultimately, we’re trying to meet customers’ needs. We want to design things for functions, but also design them at a price that’s tractable too. That’s part of our design criteria. The tools that help us do that are important, such as advanced supply chain and logistics.
Q. Why locate the office in Chicago?
A. The Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (led by UI Labs) was a big part of that. And our thesis on advanced manufacturing is that it ties very much to this digital thread — and that’s what the DMDII is on. We want a front row seat to what they’re working on.
Plus, “manufacturing” Midwest! We have manufacturing going on across the country, but a lot of it is going on around the Midwest.
Q. How do you prioritize projects?
A. Within our thematic areas, we’re looking for technologies that we think will help our business units. That’s a given. We have a sense from our business units of what they consider “bleeding-from-the-neck” problems today, what they hope to get through in the next three to five years, and what’s on the horizon after that. So we’re scanning all that. We also want to prioritize companies with great management teams, great syndicate partners; for us to be successful with that company’s technology, that company needs to be successful as well.
As far as investment areas, we’re interested in the robotics and automation side of the house, field services, and we’re also looking at a lot of technology around additive manufacturing as well, leveraging novel materials.
Q. What’s the most important thing to remember when building this capacity for the first time? Or to maintain it?
A: I think in doing this, GE really did it right from the perspective of putting together a team with a bunch of people who came out of financial venture investing, coupled with people with long tenures at GE. It creates a tension in itself — in the way we think, in operating pace, and so on. But it’s probably the best way to access what’s going on externally, and drive it into businesses. You have to have both in mind.

Merger and acquisition activity gathers momentum in insuranceMerger and acquisition activity gathers momentum in insurance
M Saraswathy | Mumbai Oct 03, 2014 12:40 AM IST
The Indian insurance sector has, of late, been witnessing a spate of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) with many joint venture partners expressing their intent to look for new partners.
Over the past 18 months, there have been at least six instances of stakeholders in insurance ventures expressing their desire to exit. These included Exide Life Insurance, Future Generali India Life Insurance and DHFL Pramerica Life.
According to Ashvin Parekh, managing partner at Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services, one reason why companies want to exit insurance is because leveraging has not been happening in the sector.
"When companies get into this business, especially those from the non-financial sectors, and realise there is no leveraging, they start rethinking of their decision after a few years," he said, adding that if the company's new business and trail business (renewal) is almost the same as the industry average, then there is no cause for worry.
M&A activity in insurance began to be noted from January 2013, after Exide Industries, India's largest producer of automotive and industrial batteries, decided to acquire ING Group's stake in ING Vysya Life Insurance. Exide, which had a 50 per cent of the equity capital of ING Vysya Life Insurance, decided to acquire the remaining stake in the insurance firm. This saw ING Group exit its insurance business in India. Later, in May 2014, ING Vysya Life Insurance Company Ltd was renamed Exide Life Insurance Company.
Similarly, in July 2013, realty major DLF signed an agreement to sell its 74 per cent stake in its life insurance joint venture, DLF Pramerica Life Insurance, to Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL). DLF had then said this transaction was in line with its ongoing strategy to divest non-core businesses/ assets.
In December 2013, the deal was completed and the company was re-named DHFL Pramerica Life Insurance.
Some companies have also made decisions to divest a part of their stake to an external partner. In March 2013, Pantaloon Retail (now called Future Retail) decided to sell 22.5 per cent of its stake in Future Generali India Life Insurance to Industrial Investment Trust Limited (IITL).
In December 2013, Future Retail informed the stock exchanges that it has received the necessary regulatory and government approvals for the deal.
Now, Future Retail holds three per cent in the insurance venture, while 49 per cent is held by Sprint Advisory Services and 22.5 per cent by IITL.
With respect to foreign companies planning to exit the insurance space, while some have held back their decisions till the foreign direct investment (FDI) cap in the sector is raised to 49 per cent, the regulatory delays in approving the agreement have also been a factor to take a wait-and-watch approach. A prospective deal between a global reinsurer and an Indian corporate to begin a health insurance business was put on the back-burner due to delay in necessary approvals.
There has also been a case of a merger deal being called off. More than a year after Larsen & Toubro (L&T) General Insurance and Future Generali India Insurance announced a joint venture combining both the companies' businesses, L&T in April 2014 said the parties had decided to call off the venture. Sources had said this was due to valuation issues around the new venture.
In March 2013, L&T, Future Group and Generali Group had signed a non-binding term sheet for the merger of L&T General Insurance and Future Generali India Insurance. This was the first-of-its-kind merger that was proposed in the insurance sector. Were the merger to happen, L&T would have held a 51 per cent stake, Generali Group 26 per cent stake and 23 per cent was to be held by Future Group in the merged entity. This deal was to be approved by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) and needed to have a nod from the court as well as the Competition Commission of India.
Parekh explained that while some exits have happened and some more may be on the anvil, unlocking has not happened in the industry.
Referring to the FDI increase in insurance sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, he said the Bill for this was pending in Parliament for a long time.
In the life insurance sector, there have been reports of some foreign companies operating in the financial services sector and having presence in India through joint venture agreements in insurance, have been planning to exit. However, these exits haven't happened owing to valuation issues and disagreement with partners.
Similarly, some non-financial sector companies that are partners in insurance companies had earlier made a re-think on their decision to continue in the venture.
Insurance sector officials said the gestation period in insurance is quite long.
"Players need to invest at least 8-10 years in a venture for it to become profitable. Making profits in a short duration is not a possibility. Hence, we are seeing more cases of exit intentions. Especially for foreign partners when the FDI incentive is not present, there is no major reward to stay invested if they are not cash-rich," said a senior life industry executive.
Jammu & Kashmir Bank and Religare Enterprises recently expressed their intent to exit from their respective life insurance investments.
In June 2014, J&K Bank informed the exchanges of its decision to sell out the entire stock of equity shares (five per cent) in PNB Metlife India Insurance, subject to the satisfactory valuations.
Similarly, Religare Enterprises expressed its desire to exit the joint venture AEGON Religare Life Insurance. Religare and Aegon have agreed that Religare will exit once a replacement shareholder is identified and is approved by the regulatory authorities.

New video shows Islamic State group beheads British hostageNew video shows beheading of British hostage by IS
PTI
Reuters This undated image shows a frame from a video released by Islamic State militants that purports to show the killing of Alan Henning by the militant group.
Cairo, Oct 4:  
An Internet video released purports to show an Islamic State group fighter beheading British hostage Alan Henning, the fourth such killing carried out by the extremist group now targeted in US—led airstrikes.
The video mirrored other beheading videos shot by the Islamic State group, which now holds territory along the border of Syria and Iraq, and ended with a militant threatening a man they identified as an American named Peter Kassig.
“Obama, you have started your aerial bombardment of Sham (Syria), which keeps on striking our people, so it is only right that we continue to strike the necks of your people,” the masked militant in the video said.
US National Security Council Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden confirmed that Kassig was held by Islamic State militants.
“At this point we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video released today. We will continue to use every tool at our disposal — military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence — to try to bring Peter home to his family,” Hayden said in a statement last night.
In a statement, the British Foreign Office said it was working to verify the video.
“If true, this is a further disgusting murder,” the statement read. “We are offering the family every support possible; they ask to be left alone at this time.”
Britain has been supporting US military efforts against the Islamic State group by using British forces to help with logistics and intelligence gathering, as well as recently taking part in airstrikes in Iraq.
British Prime Minister David Cameron said Henning’s apparent slaying showed “how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are.”
“Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need,” Cameron said in a statement. .
“The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these ... terrorists.
“We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice.”
President Barack Obama’s counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, said the US had seen the video and was evaluating it.
Later, Obama said the United States strongly condemned Henning’s “brutal murder.”
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group. The full beheadings are not shown in the videos, but the British—accented militant holds a long knife and appears to begin cutting his victims, who include American reporter James Foley, American—Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and now Henning.

British hostage Alan Henning beheaded in new ISIS videoNew ISIS video shows beheading of British hostage

An internet video released on Friday shows an Islamic State group fighter beheading British hostage Alan Henning, the fourth such killing carried out by the extremist group now targeted in US-led airstrikes.
The video mirrored other beheading videos shot by the Islamic State group, which now holds territory along the border of Syria and Iraq, and ended with a militant threatening a man they identified as an American named Peter Kassig.
"Obama, you have started your aerial bombardment of Shams (Syria), which keeps on striking our people, so it is only right that we continue to strike the neck of your people," the masked militant in the video said.
National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden confirmed that Kassig was being held by Islamic State militants, in a statement issued on Friday evening.
"At this point we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video released earlier today (Friday). We will continue to use every tool at our disposal - military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence - to try to bring Peter home to his family," Hayden said.
The Associated Press could not immediately verify the video's authenticity, though it was released in the same manner as other Islamic State group videos and the masked militant sounded similar to the one who carried out the other slayings.

Later, Obama said the United States strongly condemned Henning's "brutal murder." He said the US, along with Britain and other allies, will "work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder" to justice and will continue to "taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic State group.
French President Francois Hollande said he is "outraged by the heinous crime."
"This crime like previous ones will not be unpunished. France will continue to lend support to the people and authorities of Iraq in their fight against terrorism," Hollande said in a statement.
On Friday night, the UN Security Council condemned the video, saying it "once again illustrates the brutality" of the Islamic State group, adding that its members believe "such continued acts of barbarism perpetrated by ISIL do not intimidate them but rather stiffen their resolve."
This is the fourth such video released by the Islamic State group. The full beheadings are not shown in the videos, but the British-accented, English-speaking militant holds a long knife and appears to begin cutting his victims, who include American reporter James Foley, American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and now Henning.
FBI director James Comey has said American officials believe they know the identity of the masked militant, though he's declined to name the man or reveal his nationality.
Kassig, a 26-year-old American now threatened by the Islamic State group, enlisted in the Army in 2004, and became a Ranger, ultimately serving in the 75th Ranger Regiment, an Army special operations unit.
According to his military record, Kassig trained at Fort Benning, Georgia in 2006, and deployed to Iraq from April to July 2007. He was medically discharged at the rank of private first class in September 2007. His home of record at the time of his enlistment was Indianapolis, Indiana.
His parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, issued a statement through a media relations firm, asking for the world to pray for their son.
"The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning. We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration," the statement said. "We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe."
The family said Kassig had been working for the relief organization SERA when he was captured on October 1, 2013 on his way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria. He converted to Islam while in captivity and the family has heard from former hostages that his faith has provided him comfort.
Henning, 47, nicknamed "Gadget," had joined an aid convoy and was taken captive on December 26, shortly after crossing the border between Turkey and Syria. Earlier this week, Henning's wife Barbara Henning asked the militants in a televised plea: "Please release him. We need him back home."
Dozens of Muslim leaders in Britain have urged the Islamic State group to release Henning. His wife had said she had been given hope by "the outcry across the world" over her husband's imprisonment.
Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Henning "a British hero."
His "barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world," Shafiq said.
The Islamic State group has its roots in al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody 3-year civil war in neighbouring Syria, growing stronger to the point of being able to launch a lightning offensive across much of northern Iraq, routing security forces there and shooting down an Iraqi helicopter on Friday. The group has become known for filming and releasing footage of mass shootings it conducts, as well as beheading opponents and targeting religious and ethnic minorities in the areas it attacks.
The extremist group has been widely denounced by mainstream Muslim authorities.
Other foreigners are believed held by the Islamic State group. On Friday, the father of John Cantlie, a British photojournalist held by the group, appealed for his release in a video, saying he was a friend of Syria.

Modi sounds poll bugle  tells Haryana voters to oust CongressComments
Five months after a highly successful Lok Sabha election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is back to doing what he does best — working the crowds, wooing them with his one-liners and boundless energy. His request: absolute majority for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana.

Kicking off his campaign for the October 15 assembly polls on Saturday, Modi slipped easily into his role of champion vote-seeker at his first rally of the day — in the northern state’s Karnal district. Accusing the ruling Congress and opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) of neglecting farmers and promoting goondaism, he appealed to voters to give the BJP a chance.
Alleging irregularities in land allotment, he asked, “Who among the poor has got a plot? ...But where have thousands of acres of land disappeared, who has taken this? Does Haryana want to settle the account?”
In a veiled attack on the INLD, he asked the people if they would like to be governed from jail. INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, serving a jail sentence in a corruption case but currently out on bail, had said he’d take oath as CM from Tihar.

Promising development and jobs, he hinted that Karnal may be part of his 100 smart cities project. And carrying forward his Swachh Bharat mission, he said, “We may be living in the age of Hi-Fi and Wi-Fi but safai (cleanliness) is equally important.”
Ending the day in Mumbai, he told a crowd at the Mahalaxmi Race Course, “Mumbai and Maharashtra’s growth is important for the country’s growth. I can’t leave Mumbai helpless any longer. The city is the birthplace of the BJP, which has achieved so much in such a short time.”
Attacking the ruling Congress and its ally, the NCP, but choosing to ignore former ally Shiv Sena, Modi said, “Amitabh Bachchan hosts a TV show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, but these Congress and NCP leaders have been playing Kaun Banega Arabpati all these years. Did 15 years of Congress-NCP government do any good to you, to farmers, to the poor?”
Watch: Modi, sounds poll bugle, tells Haryana voters to oust Congress
“Believe me, I can change Mumbai and Maharashtra. This is the city where most terrorist attacks happened, where most communal riots happened. Who is responsible? Do you not want to get rid of this?”
Earlier, in Beed and Aurangabad in drought-affected central Maharashtra, he appealed to voters to work towards a majority government of the BJP.
At each of his rallies, the PM also made it a point to recall his American trip, telling people, “I think small, but I think of doing big things for small people. Did India’s name ever reverberate in the US before? It did this time, not because of Modi but because of its 125 crore people.”
The audience, hanging on to Modi’s every word, didn’t have time for other speakers. Karnal MP Ashwini Kumar Chopra Minna had to leave his address mid-way after being booed. “I know you all have come to listen to Modiji, I can talk to you some other day,” he said.
Empty vessels make the most noise: Sonia Gandhi
Barely two hours after his Karnal speech, Sonia hit out at Modi at a rally in Meham, saying “empty vessels make the most noise”.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence,” she said.
"Has inflation come down? Is the poor man getting food at cheaper rate? Have the unemployed got jobs?" she asked.
Over the next 10 days Modi will be on a campaign blitzkrieg in the two poll-bound states, with over 10 rallies in Haryana and more than 20 in Maharashtra.
With no local face in these two states, the BJP is banking heavily on him for campaigning, especially since the party split with its allies, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Haryana Janhit Congress in Haryana.

False alarm: Object on Modi s standby plane  plastic wrapperComments
A dummy stun grenade was found on Saturday aboard an Air India Boeing 747 aircraft, one of two standby planes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent US visit.
As it turned out, the fake grenade had been used by the National Security Guard (NSG) for an ‘aircraft intervention drill’ a day after the PM’s departure, when the plane was released for commercial use and flown to Mumbai.
But given that such a lapse took place on an aircraft that was to serve as a replacement for Air India One if the need arose, the incident has exposed a gaping hole in the country’s aviation safety.
After its release to Air India on September 25, the double-decker plane flew on the Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah route on Friday and landed in the Saudi Arabian city early Saturday, when the discovery was made by cabin crew.
In response, Air India dismissed the “suspicious object” found on the upper deck of business class as a “plastic wrapper”, and also denied the plane was a stand by aircraft for the PM.
But late evening, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju confirmed the discovery of the empty stun grenade, calling the incident a “serious security failure”.
The government suspended four AI employees, including security managers at Mumbai and Hyderabad airports, and appointed a high-level inquiry committee chaired by AI’s joint managing director Nasir Ali. Ground-handling officers and security supervisors could also face strict action.
The NSG has said it will probe the matter. “We have ordered an inquiry to see how even an empty casing of a stun grenade, which was without any explosive material, was left behind,” said a senior NSG official. The Special Protection Group, responsible for the PM’s security, will also look into the incident.
No actual weapons or explosives are used in such drills, a senior security official said. In fact, the NSG — the country’s elite anti-hijacking and anti-terror commando force — gives a certificate to AI saying no live ammunition will be used.
The 747’s crew noticed the grenade as it rolled out from beneath one of the seats.
The pilots informed Jeddah air traffic control and the plane was moved to a remote bay for checks. “Had it come to light when the plane was airborne, it would have led to force-landing, resulting in a mid-air scare,” said a security source.
The grenade carried the marking ‘anti-riot stun grenade’ and was produced at the BSF’s Tekanpur-based Tear Smoke Unit.
In Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh, the civil aviation minister said, “Corrective measures must be taken. The incident must not be repeated.”

Pak troops target Jammu villages; truce violation in GulmargThe Army said there was also a brief ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC) in Gulmarg sector of north Kashmir last night.
Press Trust of India | Jammu/srinagar | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:09 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 3:28 pm
After shelling border hamlets along the LoC in Poonch, Pakistani troops resorted to heavy firing of mortar bombs, small and automatic weapons in Jammu region overnight leaving two persons injured.
The Army said there was also a brief ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC) in Gulmarg sector of north Kashmir last night.
“Pakistani Rangers resorted to firing and shelling of mortar bombs targeting border hamlets and Border Out Posts (BoPs) along the International Border in R S Pura belt of Jammu district since last night”, a police officer said today.
In the firing and shelling, four BoPs and Channa, Kako De Kothay, Kodwal and Devigarh villages were hit. Two persons were injured in Kako-De-Kothay village, officer said.
Seven houses suffered partial damage in the firing, the officer said.
BSF troops guarding the border took position and fired back resulting in exchanges which continued till midnight.
This is the seventh ceasefire violation in the past four days by Pakistani troops along LoC and IB in Poonch and Jammu districts since October one. There have been four ceasefire violations along LoC in Poonch and the along IB in Jammu.
One girl was killed and 10 people injured in firing and mortar shelling along LoC in Sabjian forward belt of Poonch district in the past three days.
In Srinagar, General Officer Commanding of Srinagar-based 15 Corps Lt Gen Subrata Saha told reporters today that there was a brief ceasefire violation along the LoC in Gulmarg sector of north Kashmir.
“On the intervening night of September 30 and October 1, the first ceasefire violation took place in Poonch sector.
Yesterday, it was in the south of Gulmarg as well.The effects were more pronounced on the Poonch side.It was very much there on our side but comparatively not significant,” he said.
Lt Gen Saha said the Army was studying the pattern of the frequent ceasefire violations and it was premature to say if there was any design behind it.
“Basically, we are still studying the things. Yesterday’s firing lasted for around four hours. It was not absolutely continuous but intermittent. The highest caliber that we could make out from the bombs lying on the Poonch side was a 120 mm bomb. We are analysing it, we are trying to see where does it fit in the larger picture,” he said.
He said Army responded to the ceasefire violations in an appropriate manner and has taken up the matter at various levels.
“Whenever there has been any such ceasefire violation, they have been responded to appropriately, both in terms of the response on the ground along the LoC and also putting it across as far as ceasefire agreements or shall we say ceasefire understanding are concerned.

Illegal Hong Kong protests can cause havoc  China warns'Illegal’ Hong Kong protests can cause havoc, China warns

Reuters Pro-democracy protesters block a main junction at Hong Kong's shopping Mongkok district October 4, 2014. More than a thousand rival protesters, some wearing helmets, faced off in a densely populated, gritty district of Hong Kong on Saturday, fuelling concerns that the Chinese-controlled city's worst unrest in decades could take a more violent turn.
Reuters Police separate an injured man from the crowd after a scuffle when he tried to remove a barricade set up by pro-democracy protesters blocking a main road at Hong Kong's shopping Mongkok district October 4, 2014.
Beijing, Oct 4:  
Terming the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong as “illegal”, China today warned that the agitation that has paralysed the city would end up creating havoc in the former British colony.
Democracy and the rule of law are interdependent, and a democracy without the rule of law will only bring havoc, a new commentary in the ruling Communist Party of China’s (CPC) People’s Daily said.
In recent days, protests have been staged in Hong Kong in the name of seeking “real universal suffrage,” causing traffic jams, fewer tourists, the stock market plunging and the suspension of schools and stores.
“All these chaotic scenes have caused worries and irritation among Hong Kong citizens,” excerpts of the commentary carried by state-run Xinhua news agency said.
The former British colony which was integrated with China in 1997 is governed by Beijing under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle.
The agitators opposed rules to vet the contestants for the 2017 elections for the Chief Executive.
The week-long agitation in which thousands of students and youth took part was seen as a big setback for efforts to integrate it with the mainland.
While the Chinese government is virtually closed due to the week-long National Day holiday since October 1, official media attacked the agitators alleging that they damaged the interests of Hong Kong and the wide extent of losses the business-friendly financial hub suffered due to the protests.
The so-called “Occupy Central” protests are aiming to realise political intentions that violate Hong Kong’s Basic Law through unlawful means, and however the organisers and instigators labelled such acts as “peaceful” or “non-violent,” they cannot change the illegal nature of the protests, the People’s Daily commentary said.
“These acts will undoubtedly end up with the rule of law violated, severely disrupted social orders, huge economic losses and possible casualties,” says the opinion piece.
Police today said they have arrested 19 people, some of whom are believed to have organised crime ties, after mobs tried to drive pro-democracy protesters from the streets where they have held a week-long, largely peaceful demonstration.
At least 12 people and six officers were injured during the clashes, police said.
Protest leaders called off planned talks with the government on political reforms after the battles broke out yesterday afternoon in Mong Kok area.

How learning Russian can make you better at mathLanguage
October 4, 2014
At first glance, Russian seems to have no more connection to mathematics than any other language. But Barbara Oakley,  author of the book A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra), says it was learning Russian that helped her finally grasp math at age 26—and eventually become an electrical engineer and education author.
Oakley wrote a piece for Nautilus explaining how, after a childhood of flunking through math classes, she was finally able to grasp and retain the skill. With Newton’s second law of f =ma, for example:
I practiced feeling what each of the letters meant—f for force was a push, m for mass was a kind of weighty resistance to my push, and a was the exhilarating feeling of acceleration. (The equivalent in Russian was learning to physically sound out the letters of the Cyrillic alphabet.) I memorized the equation so I could carry it around with me in my head and play with it. If m and a were big numbers, what did that do to f when I pushed it through the equation? If f was big and a was small, what did that do to m? How did the units match on each side? Playing with the equation was like conjugating a verb.
The trick was to approach math the way she had approached Russian: she memorized an equation the way she had memorized Russian verbs, and then tested them in every possible—and impossible—tense and conjugation. With equations, she tested what happens when you change the values in different scenarios.
Over time, Oakley—and Army veteran who is now an engineering professor at Oakland University—trained her brain to learn the different scenarios, which increased an understanding of the concept itself.
This is a different approach than the recent Common Core standards in the US, which sometimes emphasize understanding the concept more than practicing it .
Oakley didn’t realize it at the time, but she was engaging in a learning practice that has long been proven to work  (pdf) among masters of many fields: chunking. Oakley describes the process in chess players:
Chess masters, for example, can recall tens of thousands of different chess patterns. Whatever the discipline, experts can call up to consciousness one or several of these well-knit-together, chunked neural subroutines to analyze and react to a new learning situation. This level of true understanding, and ability to use that understanding in new situations, comes only with the kind of rigor and familiarity that repetition, memorization, and practice can foster.
So in other words, practice really does make perfect.

Sonia Gandhi hits out at Narendra Modi  questions his promise on bringing back black moneyComments
In a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi on Saturday said the new government was behaving as if governments since independence have done nothing for the country and asked him what happened to his promise of bringing back black money.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence and they will change everyone’s fortunes overnight. Have any steps been taken to fulfil the promises made during the elections.
“…What happened to their promise of getting back the black money from abroad within 100 days of coming to power. Have any steps been taken in this regard? Absolutely not,” Gandhi said at a rally in Meham, hours after Modi urged voters in Haryana to oust the Congress.
“A country is not built in a day’s time. For the development of a nation it takes years of hard work, the right intention and the willingness to sacrifice,” she said.
Accusing Modi government of hijacking policies of previous Congress regimes, she urged the people not to get swayed by “hollow promises” and said that Congress was the only party which would ensure that development continues in Haryana.
“At the time of the elections, I urge you to take a decision after listening to your brain and not your heart. To seek votes, they try to play with your emotions, make hollow promises. Beware of such designs,” the Congress President said.
“Those who lure people with their false dreams only to secure power have nothing to do with progress or people of the state,” she said.
She also accused the ruling BJP of rechristening the schemes of the UPA and presenting them before people, after having criticised the same schemes during UPA regime.
Gandhi also urged people of the state to elect the Congress once again to ensure speedy progress and to take forward the development initiated by the party in the last 10 years for it to be cited as an example across the country.
“Congress is not such a party which believes in presenting others’ works as its own,” she said.
Praising the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government for ushering in all-round development in various spheres of life, she said, “In the last 10 years, Congress party has laid a strong foundation for the state’s progress and will take it forward on the path of development in the next five years…Only Congress party can do this work of initiating development.”
She also attacked the BJP and INLD for indulging in “caste politics”.
Stating that these elections are very important for Haryana, Gandhi asked if any of the promises made by BJP during Lok Sabha elections five months ago have been fulfilled after coming to power.
“Have prices come down? Have the poor started getting cheaper meals a day or have the youth got more employment?” she said.
Gandhi claimed that there was an atmosphere of fear prevailing in Haryana before the Congress came to power and said her party led by Hooda had ushered in speedy progress and development in the state.

Patna district administration deny lapses  says tragedy result of suffocationPress Trust of India | Patna | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:24 pm
Facing flak for the stampede at Gandhi Maidan that left 33 dead and 29 injured, Patna district administration on Saturday denied lapses and said the tragedy “seems to be result of suffocation” due to the huge gathering of people for Dusshera celebrations.
“People appear to have died due to suffocation,” District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma told reporters at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj echoing him attributed the tragedy to ‘asphyxiation’.
“CCTV footage shows movement of a huge mass of people and there is no clear picture of stampede visible in the footage the incident (the deaths) seems to have happened due to suffocation,” he said.
“Some people are seen falling and others picking them up, light was dim as the high mast light was not functioning near Ramgulam chowk… CCTV footage due to poor light is not conclusive,” the SSP told a press conference at the PMCH principal’s chamber.
He denied lathicharge by police, which eyewitnesses alleged triggered the stampede and at the same time did not rule out the role of rumours as part of a ‘conspiracy’ behind the tragedy.
Some people are being questioned in this respect and the police was in the process of registering an FIR in the incident. “We are also checking how far the falling of an electric wire or a ditch in which the feet of some people were trapped caused panic among crowd are true,” Maharaj said.
Verma dismissed allegations that the gates of GandhiMaidan was kept closed, except for the one that opened near Ramgulam chowk. “Gates were not closed. All the four gates including the one for VIPs were open… This can be seen in CCTV footage which cannot lie,” he asserted.
Asked about the poor light condition in Gandhi maidan, the DM said lighting arrangement was the responsibility of the Puja committee. He said some lights were functional while some others were not working.
Meanwhile, Principal Secretary (home) Amir Subhani and Additional Director General of Police (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey, who have been asked by the state government to probe the stampede, visited the spot.
“We have come here as part of the probe,” Subhani told reporters. The two top officials saw a ditch under the iron gate that opened on the side of Ramgulam chowk. They also saw some iron rods of the cover on the ditch were uprooted. Some eyewitnesses had claimed that the feet of some people were trapped in it causing panic among crowd. Pandey said they would host an open session at the collectorate on October 7 in which people could depose before the probe team.

Tatkal tickets on 80 trains to cost moreTatkal tickets on 80 trains to cost more
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 3, 2014  | 09:40 IST
The Indian Railways has brought in a dampener for the festive season by switching to a dynamic pricing system that will push up fares for Tatkal tickets.
The new scheme, under which 50 per cent of the tatkal quota tickets will be sold using the dynamic fare system, is being described as a preventive measure to deal with the menace of touts.
The Premium Tatkal Ticket scheme became operational in 80 trains from October 1 and is available only for online bookings . The official explained that after booking of the first 50 per cent of the tatkal quota under the present tatkal scheme, the subsequent 50 per cent of the tatkal quota, defined as 'premium tatkal quota' will be issued on dynamic pricing which means the higher the demand, the higher the price.
Under the scheme, railways will charge normal tatkal fare for 50 per cent of the total tickets available. But for subsequent 10 per cent tickets, 20 per cent more will be charged which means after selling 50 per cent of tatkal tickets, the national transporter will keep increasing the fare with the sale of tickets.
For example, if there are 60 seats available in third AC coach of any train, then 30 tickets will be sold on normal tatkal fare.
Out of rest 30 tickets, 10 per cent or nearly 3 tickets will be sold on 20 per cent increased fare. Again, for 27 remaining seats, the cost will go up by 20 per cent.
Similarly, the charges will keep on rising with ever sale of ticket. The scheme is, however, applicable on select trains. All railway zones have been asked to identify five popular trains in their respective zone, said the official.
Northern Railway has selected five popular trains to implement Premium Tatkal scheme including Vaishali express, Saptakranti express, Swatantrata Senani express and both Rajdhani trains to Mumbai.
Some trains which have been identified for implementation of the scheme are Hyderabad-New Delhi Andhra Pradesh Express, Hyderabad-Hazrat Nizamuddin Dakshin Express and Secunderabad-Howrah Falaknuma Express.

Forex reserves continue to move down; fall by another $1.4 billionForex reserves continue to move down; fall by another $1.4 billion
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Oct 03, 2014 07:00 PM IST
Falling for the fourth week in a row, India's foreign exchange reserves went down by $1.415 billion to $314.181 billion in the week to September 26 on account of a hefty drop in non-US currency assets.
In the previous week, the reserves had fallen by $101.3 million to $315.596 billion. During the week to July 25, the reserves had touched $320.56 billion, a shade away from the life-time high of $320.79 billion recorded on September 2, 2011.
During the reporting week, the foreign currency assets (FCAs), a major constituent of overall reserves, dropped by $1.391 billion to $287.392 billion, RBI data showed.
FCAs, expressed in dollar terms, include the effect of appreciation/depreciation of the non-US currencies such as the euro, pound and yen held in reserves.
Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has described the fall in reserves as dip in valuation with appreciation of dollar against other currencies.
"In the recent weeks the dollar has been appreciating against the other currencies. Therefore, when we look at our reserves in dollar terms, they have been coming down," Rajan had said on the policy day on Tuesday.
He added that the fall in the forex kitty was not due to the central bank selling the greenback.
The gold reserves remained unchanged in the week under review at $20.933 billion.
The special drawing rights were down $17.4 million to $4.307 billion, while the country's reserve position with the IMF dipped by $6.2 million to $1.548 billion during the week, the data showed.

On National Manufacturing Day  Congress Must Recommit Itself to Investing in a Strong Manufacturing Futurereddit
As we mark National Manufacturing Day, Americans ought to be filled with pride in our role as the world's manufacturing leader.  But we cannot take that leadership for granted, as our competitors across the globe seek to lure manufacturing jobs away from our shores.  That's why National Manufacturing Day ought to be a day of action to secure our competitive edge and recommit ourselves to helping America's manufacturers create jobs here at home.
Today, President Obama is visiting Millennium Steel in Princeton, Indiana -- one of the nation's largest minority-owned manufacturing companies -- and asking Americans to see for themselves what our manufacturing sector is doing to grow our economy and create good jobs.  He's asking all of us to consider the role manufacturing plays in our economy and in our lives -- and what we as a nation can and must do to help our manufacturing sector succeed.
Manufacturing has been the backbone of our economy since the Industrial Revolution. For generations, Americans have proudly gone to work in some of the most innovative factories to produce goods that have changed the world.  American steel built our cities, and American-made technologies powered the first computers that guided our astronauts to the moon and launched the information age.  Most important, America's manufacturers created good jobs that built a strong middle class through opportunity and advancement.
Manufacturing jobs have traditionally paid higher wages and offered competitive benefits that help workers access a range of opportunities, such as homeownership, higher education, affordable health care, and a secure retirement.  They are the jobs that sustain our middle class and make the American Dream attainable for millions.
Over the past three decades, though, as our competitors overseas took aggressive steps to attract investment, many of the manufacturing jobs that had fueled our economy for so long began to disappear.  But the tide has begun to turn back our way, as international shipping of important products has become more expensive, as our country produces more energy at home, as the cost of labor overseas has increased, and as new, advanced technology manufacturers look to co-locate research, design, and production near one another.  Over the past few years, our manufacturing sector has seen strong gains that reveal a potential for explosive growth -- but only if Congress can capitalize on these gains by investing in a more competitive economy.
Since 2010, I've been leading an effort in Congress to invest in economic competitiveness and manufacturing growth.  Our plan, called Make It In America, focuses on four key areas that have strong, bipartisan support:  adopting a national manufacturing strategy, promoting U.S. exports, encouraging the return of jobs and innovation from overseas, and securing a twenty-first century workforce.  More than seventy bills have been introduced that aim to advance these four goals.  Among the legislation we've introduced under this plan are bills to make the research and development tax credit permanent, provide small business exporters with certainty through a multi-year reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, invest in rebuilding and upgrading freight infrastructure, and facilitate new and innovative public-private partnerships to create talent pipelines from schools to colleges to careers.
Make It In America legislation deserves to be considered and voted on by the House so that we can create the conditions that will help businesses grow and succeed, but the Republican Majority has blocked action.  While Republicans continue their policy of obstruction, Democrats and the president will keep doing everything possible to support a strong manufacturing renaissance for America.
At the president's request, more than 1,300 manufacturers across the country will be open for visitors to mark National Manufacturing Day.  These businesses are eager to show them what cutting-edge American manufacturing is all about.  I hope Americans will take advantage of this opportunity to tour factories and meet with the men and women who are driving our manufacturing resurgence -- and hear firsthand about why they need a Congress that doesn't tell manufacturing businesses and workers that they are on their own.  Instead, it's time they had a Congress that is truly on their side.

Modi seeks clear mandate for Haryanas developmentregional elections
Launching the BJP campaign for the Haryana Assembly elections here, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday appealed to the voters to elect the party with a clear majority, “so that there is no hurdle between the Prime Minister and you, the people of Haryana.”
“If you want to move ahead, you must free Haryana from Congress misrule,” he said adding that he was confident the State would elect a BJP government. He recalled his long association with the State as party general secretary in-charge of Haryana and said, “Whenever I am here it feels like homecoming.” In a dig at the Congress, Mr. Modi said: “Those who have done nothing for the country in the last 60 years now want an account of my 60 days in office.”
He also attacked the Indian National Lok Dal and its chief Om Prakash Chautala who is campaigning across the State despite being on bail on medical grounds. The State BJP unit was present in full strength at the first of Mr Modi’s proposed ten election rallies in the State. In the absence of a leader with a pan-Haryana appeal, the party is banking heavily on Mr. Modi to re-kindle the Modi effect seen during the Lok Sabha polls when the party won seven out of the ten seats. Mr. Modi said that because of the decisive mandate given to his government at the Centre, there was new respect for India across the world.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011. The three-year anniversary that historic passing is this Sunday, so Tim Cook sent an email to Apple employees reflecting on Jobs' global impact.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
By Sam Colt
Apple co-founder Steve Jobs passed away on Oct. 5, 2011, due to complications stemming from his battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 56.
The three-year anniversary that historic passing is this Sunday, so Tim Cook sent an email to Apple employees reflecting on Jobs' global impact.
We first got wind of the email from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman.
Here's what Cook had to say:
Team,
Sunday will mark the third anniversary of Steve's passing. I'm sure that many of you will be thinking of him on that day, as I know I will.
I hope you'll take a moment to appreciate the many ways Steve made our world better. Children learn in new ways thanks to the products he dreamed up. The most creative people on earth use them to compose symphonies and pop songs, and write everything from novels to poetry to text messages. Steve's life's work produced the canvas on which artists now create masterpieces.
Steve's vision extended far beyond the years he was alive, and the values on which he built Apple will always be with us. Many of the ideas and projects we're working on today got started after he died, but his influence on them - and on all of us - is unmistakable.
Enjoy your weekend, and thanks for helping carry Steve's legacy into the future.
- Tim
Apple usually reflects on Jobs' legacy in some way around this time every year since his passing.
Last year, Cook emailed employees. In 2012, Cook posted a letter to the company's website. And the day after Jobs passed in 2011, the company posted a Jobs remembrance to its homepage, which remains on the site to this day.

With huge search area mapped  MH370 huntresumingPrint
Associated Press | Sydney | Posted: October 4, 2014 3:56 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 3:57 pm
In a bid to finally solve one of the world’s most perplexing aviation mysteries, the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is about to resume in a desolate stretch of the Indian Ocean, with searchers lowering new equipment deep beneath the waves.
The GO Phoenix, the first of three ships that will spend up to a year hunting for the wreckage far off Australia’s west coast, is expected to arrive in the search zone Sunday, though weather could delay its progress.
Crews will use sonar, video cameras and jet fuel sensors to scour the water for any trace of the Boeing 777, which disappeared March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.
The search has been on hold for months so crews could map the seabed in the search zone, about 1,800 kilometers west of Australia. The 60,000-square kilometer search area lies along what is known as the “seventh arc” a stretch of ocean where investigators believe the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, based largely on an analysis of transmissions between the plane and a satellite.
“We’re cautiously optimistic; cautious because of all the technical and other challenges we’ve got, but optimistic because we’re confident in the analysis,” said Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the agency leading the search. “But it’s just a very big area that we’re looking at.”
Two ships have been surveying the seabed using on-board multibeam sonar devices, similar to a fish-finder. The maps thus formed are considered crucial to the search effort because the seafloor is riddled with deep crevasses, mountains and volcanoes.
Two of the search ships will be using underwater search vessels worth around USD 1.5 million each.
“You can imagine if you’re towing a device close to the seafloor, you want to know if you’re about to run into a mountain,” said Stuart Minchin, chief of the environmental geoscience division at Geoscience Australia, which has been analysing the mapping data.
“In all sorts of ways we’re operating towards the limits of the technology that is available,” Dolan said.
Malaysia and Australia are each contributing around USD 60 million to fund the search.
David Gallo, who helped lead the search for Air France Flight 447 after it crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, said that even if the fuel tanks had survived the impact, strong currents in the search area probably would have dispersed any leaking fuel by now. Still, he said, it’s worth a try.
There will be between 25 and 35 people on each ship, and crews will likely work around the clock. The ships can stay at the search site for up to 30 days before they must head back to shore to refuel and resupply.
“The most efficient way is to keep going,” Dolan said. “But you have to be continued…

Big-ticket FDI to wait for India policy action: VC proEverybody loved the lines that he said:
Parag Saxena
CEO
New Silk Route Partners
Soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a knockout speech at Madison Square Garden, CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan caught up with a Wall Street veteran to see he made of the speech as well as whether he believes Modi's election will serve as the the next big trigger for spurring foreign investments into India.
In the this interview, Parag Saxena, founding general partner and CEO of New Silk Route Partners, a venture capital firm, discussed his analysis of the speech.

Q: You were at the Madison Square Garden, the Indian-American community was enthused by what the Prime Minister had to say but there were a bunch of Congressmen there as well, do you believe they bought what Narendra Modi was selling?
A: I think they did. I had a chance to speak to several of them right after that. They had a little gathering near Madison Square Garden and I think they all came away seeing what a rockstar he is, a rockstar who as you know operated without lyrics. So, they came away very impressed by him.
Q: What do you think impressed them the most because we have seen Indian politicians make these promises before, opening up India for business, from moving red tape and so on and so forth. Why do you think that they would believe Narendra Modi in comparison to what we have seen happen in the past?
A: I do think there will be a wait and see on that. Since the damage from the past in believing that and then not having fulfilment is still fresh. It is a recent enough wound that people will remember that. I think there is a great deal of belief that here is a person who has come in with an actual majority, who seems like a firm person - a person who speaks strongly, a person who has come out like a lion to say here is the agenda that I have - this is my clean agenda, this is my small vision. I think he did that brilliantly in the way he conveyed that and the US Congressmen that I spoke to afterwards were very impressed by that.
Q: But is that also a concern the fact that he is this lion, this strong tough guy who may not perhaps play ball with the US on matters in which the US would like India to concede and give ground?
A: While people are concerned that Gujarat may not scale up to India, they do allow a great deal for the fact that Gujarat did have some very significant developments. When you speak to anybody who has done a little bit of reading or has visited India whether it is the average American or whether it is somebody from Congress, they do know about that experience. And they are assuming that that’s a good proven state.
The US has had many state governors like Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton who have gone on to become very successful presidents and so they see that that’s a model that has worked inAmerica, probably it is a model that works in India. Of course the complexities are different, India is more like Europe in the sense that we have many different languages and systems, more complexity of religion, etc which may be harder to handle. However, people are given to being optimistic with the wave of optimism that he has brought in.
Q: We are seeing sentiment change, the mood has definitely improved over the last couple of months, even before Modi actually took office in the hope that he would take office and since then we have seen sentiment change and improve. But there is also a concern that expectations are so high that if this government doesn’t start to deliver on the promises that the PM is making that we will see the degree of disappointment being proportionate to the expectations, which is not good for India.
A: What comes up must come down as they say. You are right but the question then becomes how much time do we have? Do we have enough time till the next Budget because by then delivery must happen? But the world has changed in the sense that if we go back 20 years, the Budget was the primary mechanism for delivering policy change but today that is no longer so. People take interim steps upto the budget and it is up to the government.
So the PM has laid out some things that are really important for him and laid out the rationale for those. I am talking about things like sanitation or cleaning up which is a subset of sanitation. So he has laid out some of those things.
Now he has begun the ‘Make in India’ programme and it was a beginning on how he is going to make it easier for you. He clearly understands these things extremely well. He has an intuitive grasp of them which is remarkable.
He comes across as being an extremely practical person who understands these things and wants to simplify this stuff. Everybody loved the lines that he said: "I want to break all the rules that are unnecessary". People like that so they will expect that but he does have to deliver.
Q: For instance? What do you think they need to prioritise and deliver on over the next 3 months?
A: If you think about what international investors are most afraid of is this business of retroactive something.
Q: Which they haven’t done anything with. They have set up a committee, the law stays, they have of course articulated publicly several times over that they don’t intend to go back to an era of retrospective action but is that enough, are investors convinced with that?
A: I think they need to say something more strongly than that. Something actually needs to change. How GAAR will be dealt with, there is no clarity on that. I think those are steps that must be taken and must be taken before the Budget comes about because people are going to look for certainty on those things before they put down serious money back into India.
Q: He had a meeting with top CEOs of corporate America, in a sense preaching to the converted because these are guys who have already put significant amounts of money into India. So the hope perhaps is that they will continue to incrementally invest in India and also spread the message and get new investments coming into India. Do you believe that big ticket FDI is likely to come in only post the next Budget or when we do see clarity as far as some of these issues are concerned?
A: Big ticket FDI is certainly going to wait. Corporations are cautious by nature. They want to see proof of things, they will not do it on expectations. People who will perhaps act a little bit on expectations are to some extent private equity players which from the point of view of India and I say this being someone in that business, from the point of view of India it is actually just as attractive money. It builds, it builds for the long term, it does not come in and leave and they might take a little bit of a leap of faith but they too before real money comes in, before the kind of FDI that India should see which is USD 50 billion and above before that kind of money comes in more certainty has to happen.
Q: What would convince private equity to come into India in a much more significant fashion? The KKRs of the world have been around but the fact remains that exits have been hard, predictability has been an issue, certainty has been an issue, what do you think will be the triggers to really get big ticket private equity money into India?
A: I think you hit the nail on the head with the first one of those, exits have to happen. People are sitting around especially with the wave of money that came in 2007-2008 but less than 10 IPOs have been filed since the election -- that is a stunningly low number. We should see 10 IPOs a week at some point in time not in months. So, that has to change.
Q: Do you see that picking up? Do you see the IPO cycle picking up? We have seen a few in the last couple of months but do you see a more robust IPO pipeline in the making?
A: I do see more filings happening at this point in time. So, that needs to translate into IPOs. I would expect that post Diwali you will start to see more activity on that front and more IPOs will happen. That should lead to the beginning of a virtuous cycle. Money going back to people should attract more money into the country. As investors receive capital back from investments with a profit they should come back into the country, I think you should see that.
The early QIPs that were done have not done well. They raised very large sums of money and they have had negative returns. So, that was not a good beginning. On the other hand we have had a couple of IPOs that have done extremely well, the one in the logistics space which has done extremely well. So, once you see a couple more of those happen you could possibly see a wave of money.
However interestingly it is not just overseas money, a very large part of what the country needs to do efficiently is to mobilise the capital internally not just the capital externally. External capital will come in, it will compare India to other countries. So, there is a extra hurdle that you have to go through.
Would you rather put that money in a very cheap Russia, there are lots of issues with Russia but it is very cheap. Would you rather put that money in Brazil, would you rather put that money in South Africa, you will have those comparisons. However domestic mobilisation of capital is another thing which should be done. IPOs after all must also be funded by locals.

Modi behaving as if governments since independence have done nothing: Sonia24

Meham (Rohtak): In a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi on Saturday said the new government was behaving as if governments since independence have done nothing for the country and asked him what happened to his promise of bringing back black money.
"They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence and they will change everyone's fortunes overnight. Have any steps been taken to fulfil the promises made during the elections. What happened to their promise of getting back the black money from abroad within 100 days of coming to power. Have any steps been taken in this regard? Absolutely not," Gandhi said at a rally, hours after Modi urged voters in Haryana to oust the Congress.
"A country is not built in a day's time. For the development of a nation it takes years of hard work, the right intention and the willingness to sacrifice," she said.
"A country is not built in a day's time. For the development of a nation it takes years of hard work," she said.

Accusing Modi government of hijacking policies of previous Congress regimes, she urged the people not to get swayed by "hollow promises" and said that Congress was the only party which would ensure that development continues in Haryana.
"At the time of the elections, I urge you to take a decision after listening to your brain and not your heart. To seek votes they try to play with your emotions, may hollow promises. Beware of such designs," the Congress President said.
"Those who lure people with their false dreams only to secure power have nothing to do with progress or people of the state," she said. She also accused the ruling BJP of rechristening the schemes of the UPA and presented them before people, after having criticised the same schemes during UPA regime.
Gandhi also urged people of the state to elect the Congress once again to ensure speedy progress and to take forward the development initiated by the party in the last 10 years for it to be cited as an example across the country.
"Congress is not such a party which believes in presenting others' works as its own," she said. Praising the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government for ushering in all-round development in various spheres of life, she said, "In the last 10 years, Congress party has laid a strong foundation for the state's progress and will take it forward on the path of development in the next five years. Only Congress party can do this work of initiating development."
She also attacked the BJP and INLD for indulging in "caste politics". Stating that these elections are very important for Haryana, Gandhi asked if any of the promises made by BJP during Lok Sabha elections five months ago have been fulfilled after coming to power.
"Have prices come down? Have the poor started getting cheaper two meals a day or have the youth got more employment?" she said. Gandhi claimed that there was an atmosphere of fear prevailing in Haryana before the Congress came to power and said her party led by Hooda had ushered in speedy progress and development in the state.
Taking a dig at the BJP for presenting UPA schemes as their own, she said, "They find happiness in presenting the schemes of others as their own. When our UPA government was in power, they always used to criticise our schemes. But now they are launching schemes after renaming ours."
Claiming that the Congress has ushered in a strong foundation of development in Haryana, she said, "Congress has done the real work. In Haryana, Congress in the last 10 years has done such things which were never done earlier."
She said "to take India where it is today, every Indian has put in their labour, including that by scientists and our political and social leaders".

"Earlier the BJP use to fight polls in Haryana in alliance with other political outfits, but now the party is contesting the elections on its own," she said, seeking peoples' mandate for development of Haryana.
Swaraj said that in the Lok Sabha polls, BJP's mission was 272 plus seats and its 50 plus seats in Haryana elections now.
"We have made our mission possible in Lok Sabha by winning 282 seats of our own and will make it in Assembly elections in Haryana too," she said. Haryana has 90 Assembly seats.
Referring to BJP's performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Haryana where the party won seven out of eight seats it contested, she said Haryana had given not seven but 12 MPs to Parliament.
Besides seven MPs from Haryana, the other five MPs who belonged to the state include she herself, Gen VK Singh (retd) and Sumedha Singh.
Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving "due representation" to Haryana in his cabinet, she said "this kind of share to the state was never given earlier by any government."
She said the ministers from the state included she herself, Gen VK Singh (retd), Rao Inderjit Singh and Krishanpal Gujjar.

The best US college majors for getting very richMax Nisen @MaxNisen
October 4, 2014
Earlier this week, The Hamilton Project released data documenting the lifetime earnings of people with different college degrees in the US, compared to those who only finished high school, or had a two-year associate diplomas. The top nine college majors are all various engineering fields; the 10th, increasingly popular, is computer science.
The full rankings are available here :
But what about those who aren’t average, people that reach the very top of their profession? As Jordan Weissman points out at Slate , when you look at the 95th percentile, the earnings superstars of a given field of study, economics actually reaches the top, likely due to heavy recruiting by the lucrative finance and consulting industries.
Here are the majors where superstars end up earning the most:

When you add graduate school, economics is still dominant, but there are some other interesting changes. Majors that often lead to medical school climb towards the top. Non-engineering science majors pay off a lot more when you keep going to school, and it really pays off to be an excellent doctor.
A few majors nowhere near the top without graduate school, like history and philosophy get a huge boost, likely indicating a tendency towards business or law school:

How much is graduate school worth? It very much depends on the subject you study. Here are the majors that see the biggest jump in lifetime earnings—providing the holders of the postgraduate degrees make it to the top 5% of their profession, in terms of earnings:
It’s important to note that those in the 95th percentile are very much outliers. The average engineer or computer science major makes more than the average finance manager. On the whole, engineering seems more likely to result in a stable, well paying career. But for the exceptional, there are better options.

"Has inflation come down? Is the poor man getting food at cheaper rate? Have the unemployed got jobs?
In a swipe at Modi, Sonia said, "empty vessels make the most noise. Being loud doesn't mean you are speaking truth."

"What happened to their promise of getting back the black money from abroad within 100 days of coming to power. Have any steps been taken in this regard? Absolutely not," Gandhi said in a blistering attack on Modi at a rally here, hours after he urged voters in Haryana to oust the Congress, targeting it over alleged land scams and "anti-farmer" policies.
In a swipe at Modi, she said, "empty vessels make the most noise. Being loud doesn't mean you are speaking truth."
"A country is not built in a day's time. For the development of a nation it takes years of hard work, the right intention and the willingness to sacrifice. But today BJP is trying to show off as if all things are happening only after they came to power, that everything is happening for the first time," the Congress President said.
Gandhi today launched Congress' election campaign for October 15 polls in Haryana, where it is locked in a contest with BJP and INLD among others.
Gandhi, who sought votes for the Congress on the basis of development work done during the last ten years, charged BJP with taking credit for policies framed by previous UPA government.
He asked the people not to get swayed by emotions and false promises and vote wisely to bring back the Congress to power in Haryana for accelerated development. "At the time of the elections, I urge you to take a decision after listening to your brain and not your heart. People may try to whip up sentiments, make false promises to you, beware of them," she said.

Srinagar: Authorities on Saturday asked residents in flood-affected areas of Kashmir to carefully observe their houses over the next three months as there was a possibility of earth sinking due to movement of water under soil.
"There is a possibility of earth sinking due to movement of water under the soil.The residents in flood-affected areas, particularly those where water logging was for long periods, should be careful," Chief Engineer Roads and Buildings Department Satish Razdan told reporters.
He said the next three months are critical and residents of flooded areas should observe their houses for any cracks, which can lead to collapse of the structure.
Razdan said his department has formed five teams for the purpose of certifying safety of buildings in flood-hit areas.
#kashmir floods #jammu and kashmir floods #houses #residential areas
"Most structures look fine from appearance but there is possibility of cracks and collapses as the soil is super-saturated with water post flood," he said.
Razdan cited the example of Dawood Khaki bridge in Baba Demb area, saying some part of the bridge sank several days after the flood water had receded in the areas.
"Same is the case in Pulwama where some part of a bridge sank in six days after water receded".
The official said his department, which is mandated with certifying the safety of the buildings in flood-affected areas, gave priority to hospitals and were now focusing on schools.
"We gave priority in checking the safety of hospitals. Only 15 per cent of SKIMS Hospital at Bemina was declared unsafe while rest is safe for use again," he said. Razdan said there were thousands of school buildings in Kashmir affected by the floods and it will take a long time to ascertain safety of these buildings.
"Our engineers have multiple tasks at hand.They are part of the loss assessment teams also.It will take long time to certify all the schools affected by flood," he said.
Razdan said his department has formed five teams for the purpose of certifying safety of buildings in flood-hit areas.
Giving details of the losses in Roads and Buildings sector, the Chief Engineer said nearly 600 bridges an culverts were damaged in the floods.
"Of these, 181 structures including 54 bridges have collapsed completely," he said. The official said nearly 1700 km of road length has been damaged or washed away by the floods last month.

Thriller on the cards as Knight Riders take on Super Kings in CLT20 final
Knight Riders are on a roll with 14 straight wins, but the Champions League T20 final match against Super Kings would be a different ball game altogether.

Bangalore, Oct 3: It is probably befitting that the two best and most consistent teams, the Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings, will be playing in the final of the Oppo Champions League Twenty20 tournament, here Saturday and for the richest purse in world cricket of $2.5 million.
The Knight Riders, led by Gautam Gambhir and still in quest of their maiden CLT20 crown, are on a roll with 14 straight wins, dating from the 2014 Indian Premier League (IPL) that they won, but Saturday's game against Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Super Kings would be a different ball game altogether.
The two teams met in the opening game of the tournament last month, but in Hyderabad, where the Knight Riders were based. The Kolkata outfit won by three wickets , hunting down a target of 158.

The powerful Super Kings batting line-up was kept on a leash by three spinners, Sunil Narine , Yusuf Pathan and Piyush Chawla , with the trio conceding just 51 runs in the 11 overs they sent down.
This time around, the Knight Riders will be without the West Indian Narine , who has been suspended from bowling in the ongoing tournament after being twice reported for suspect action. Indeed, it will test the bowling strength of the team without Narine who has emerged as the spearhead.
The Super Kings, winners in 2010 when the tournament was held in South Africa, have no such worries with their key batsmen in prime form and the bowlers keeping their end up.
This was reflected in their thumping 65-run win over Kings XI Punjab in the semi-finals Thursday in Hyderabad after setting a target of 183.
Likewise, the Knight Riders have often showcased their all-round strength, notably against the Hobart Hurricanes in the semi-final Thursday, winning comfortably by seven wickets.
The team from Kolkata are no less rich in talent, experience and proven ability than the Super Kings. Both teams bat deep and have match winning bowlers, factors that put the finalists on level terms while making any prediction a hazardous exercise.
However, the Knight Riders need to be wary of the law of averages. They are on a hot and unbroken streak of 14 wins, but will be without Narine and on the morrow they will be up against the confident Super Kings who have fared well at the Chinnaswamy Stadium here.
A close match is in the offing and with the pitch receiving plenty of sunshine the past week, tall scores look likely. The Super Kings wear a more settled look and have the pedigree to win the trophy a second time.

Former SAP EVP Michael Reh joins Vishal Sikka at Infosys
ET Bureau Oct 4, 2014, 02.32PM IST

Germany
(Earlier on 12 June when Infosys…)
BANGALORE: Vishal Sikka has started putting his team in place to help steer Infosys after years of lagging behind, after a former SAP executive vice president joined Infosys as senior vice president on October 1.
Michael Reh , formerly EVP for business information and technology at SAP, will be based out of Hamburg, Germany , and reporting to one of the Executive Vice Presidents at Infosys, ET learns. Infosys currently has 12 EVPs although it is unclear for now what business will Reh be overseeing.
A spokeswoman for Infosys declined to comment.
To be sure, three other senior SAP executives, including Sanjay Rajagopalan, design and special projects head, are also on their way out from the eponymous German software firm though it is not certain for now if all of them will join Sikka at Infosys.
Earlier on 12 June when Infosys anointed Sikka as the first non-founder chief executive, the company also elevated twelve senior vice presidents to the rank of executive vice presidents. Eight of these report to Sikka directly while four of the EVPs report to chief operating officer UB Pravin Rao.
"It is quite natural for a new leader at a company to bring in a few of his former team members," said one of the executives at SAP. "It remains to be seen how many will Sikka like to bring in from SAP because he may not want to disturb the relationship between Infosys and SAP"
A spokesman for SAP said that the company is unperturbed on the four exits in the last two months and the company continues to remain a "strong attractor" for talent.
"We wish Dr. Sikka well," said a SAP spokesman. "People join and depart companies all the time and, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on individual personnel matters. This includes moves or anticipated moves or rumours. That said, SAP is a strong attractor of the world's best talent and we expect to end the year with more people than we started."

Apple s tax case: Should US also stop tax br...(In a sense, what Ireland…)
By Joe Nocera
A few weeks ago, the governor of Nevada, Brian Sandoval, signed into law a tax "incentive package" that his administration had negotiated with Tesla, the electric car company. Tesla is planning to build a giant factory to manufacture the batteries that power its cars, and Nevada was one of five states that were competing fiercely to land the plant.
It ultimately offered a staggering $1.25 billion package of tax breaks that includes sales tax abatements for the next two decades, 10 years of property tax abatements and nearly $200 million in transferable tax credits that Tesla could sell to Nevada companies that wanted to lower their own tax bills. Although Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, insisted that at least one of the other states had offered an even richer tax package, it is clear that the tax breaks Nevada came up with played an important role in landing the Tesla factory.
In reading this week about Apple's tax dealings in Ireland, I found myself reflecting on the tax deals that U.S. states cut all the time with companies they are trying to lure. It's not all that different. In a sense, what Ireland has been doing is the global equivalent of what the states do to attract business. And that is especially true in the case of Apple.
Ireland has long had one of the lowest corporate tax rates in Europe; it's currently 12.5 per cent. That low rate, the Irish believe, helped attract industry and create the country's boom in the years leading up to the financial crisis.
But it did a lot more than simply offer a low corporate tax rate. It set itself up as a kind of European tax haven, so that companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others could, in effect, buy an Irish address to which they could transfer a great deal of their intellectual property and route profits accrued elsewhere through the Irish subsidiary. This is called transfer pricing. Companies could also take advantage of other loopholes in the Irish tax code to get their tax bill considerably lower than 12.5 per cent.
As The New York Times reported in a groundbreaking article two years ago - and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations confirmed last year - Apple takes advantage of every tax break Ireland offers. But according to the European Union's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, in a letter released this week, the company went a step further in its dealings with the Irish tax authorities.
  In 1991, Apple essentially negotiated how much tax the company would pay. It did so after it had explicitly "mentioned by way of background information that Apple was now the largest employer in the Cork area with 1,000 direct employees and 500 persons engaged on a sub-contract basis," again according to Almunia's letter. Apple also acknowledged that it had "no scientific basis" for the amount of tax it was willing to pay. The deal was then "reverse engineered" so that Apple's profits would wind up in the range that would yield the suggested taxes. (Apple now has 4,000 people working in its Cork manufacturing plant, the only Apple-owned factory in Europe; its tax deal with Ireland was reworked in 2007.)
With the recent outcry over corporate tax loopholes, the EU decided to take a closer look at some of its members' tax dealings that had been flagged in the media. In addition to Apple and Ireland, it is looking at Fiat in Luxembourg and Starbucks in the Netherlands. And while the Apple case is far from over - indeed, both Apple and Ireland insist they did nothing wrong - Almunia, at least, has concluded that Apple's tax deal with Ireland amounts to "state aid." Under European Commission rules, countries are not allowed to subsidize companies in ways that give them advantages over others in the country.
Here then is one difference between what transpires in the U.S. and what transpires in Europe: The EU has rules intended to prevent nations from giving unjustified tax breaks to companies. "In Europe there is now a mechanism to prevent the most harmful abuses" of the tax code, said Matthew Gardner, the executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. It has taken a while - and required an outraged public to spur it on - but the EU finally seems intent on curbing excesses like Apple's tax deal in Ireland.
In truth, most tax subsidies don't make much sense - not for countries and certainly not for states. "There is a lot of work that shows that tax subsidies vastly overpay for the jobs they create," said Edward Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California and the author of the recent book "We Are Better Than This: How Government Should Spend Our Money."
It's a good thing that the EU is trying to curb unjustified tax breaks. Maybe it's time to do the same here.

The Swacch Bharat campaign, which kicked off on Gandhiji’s birth anniversary, is something that has cut across party, philosophy, and community lines, and is something that we sorely need as we attempt to be a world power.

Sonia Gandhi hits out at Narendra Modi  questions his promise on bringing back blackmoneyComments
In a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi on Saturday said the new government was behaving as if governments since independence have done nothing for the country and asked him what happened to his promise of bringing back black money.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence and they will change everyone’s fortunes overnight. Have any steps been taken to fulfil the promises made during the elections.
“…What happened to their promise of getting back the black money from abroad within 100 days of coming to power. Have any steps been taken in this regard? Absolutely not,” Gandhi said at a rally in Meham, hours after Modi urged voters in Haryana to oust the Congress.
“A country is not built in a day’s time. For the development of a nation it takes years of hard work, the right intention and the willingness to sacrifice,” she said.
Accusing Modi government of hijacking policies of previous Congress regimes, she urged the people not to get swayed by “hollow promises” and said that Congress was the only party which would ensure that development continues in Haryana.
“At the time of the elections, I urge you to take a decision after listening to your brain and not your heart. To seek votes, they try to play with your emotions, make hollow promises. Beware of such designs,” the Congress President said.
“Those who lure people with their false dreams only to secure power have nothing to do with progress or people of the state,” she said.
She also accused the ruling BJP of rechristening the schemes of the UPA and presenting them before people, after having criticised the same schemes during UPA regime.
Gandhi also urged people of the state to elect the Congress once again to ensure speedy progress and to take forward the development initiated by the party in the last 10 years for it to be cited as an example across the country.
“Congress is not such a party which believes in presenting others’ works as its own,” she said.
Praising the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government for ushering in all-round development in various spheres of life, she said, “In the last 10 years, Congress party has laid a strong foundation for the state’s progress and will take it forward on the path of development in the next five years…Only Congress party can do this work of initiating development.”
She also attacked the BJP and INLD for indulging in “caste politics”.
Stating that these elections are very important for Haryana, Gandhi asked if any of the promises made by BJP during Lok Sabha elections five months ago have been fulfilled after coming to power.
“Have prices come down? Have the poor started getting cheaper meals a day or have the youth got more employment?” she said.
Gandhi claimed that there was an atmosphere of fear prevailing in Haryana before the Congress came to power and said her party led by Hooda had ushered in speedy progress and development in the state.

A veteran Sri Lankan Tamil politician has written a letter to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi backing the Indian model of “devolution of power” to solve the ethnic impasse in the island nation.
“I am one who had been campaigning for an Indian model as an alternative to a federal solution,” V. Anandasangaree wrote to Mr. Modi.
Mr. Anandasangaree, 81, is the leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front and a former Member of the Parliament.
Referring to the TNA leaders’ meeting with Mr. Modi in New Delhi, Mr. Anandasangaree in his letter catalogues the links between the LTTE and the TNA.
“Indian Prime Minister’s advice would be important to find a solution to the Tamil problem but finding a solution was not the monopoly of TNA. Hence action must be taken to consult various political parties of Tamils and Tamil-speaking people,” Mr. Anandasangaree wrote in the letter.
He seeks Mr. Modi’s support to convene an all Tamil political party meeting with the possibility of discussing the Indian model of ‘devolution of power’ as a solution to the three decade old ethnic conflict in the island country between the Tamil-speaking minority and the Sinhalese majority.

China test fires 10 000-km range nuclear missile that can reach most of USChina
(The People's Liberation…)
BEIJING: China has flight tested an upgraded version of its 10,000-km range Dongfeng missile which could reach most of the US and European cities , days ahead of its October 1st National Day to demonstrate its nuclear capability, media reports said.
The People's Liberation Army, (PLA) launched a Dongfeng-31B on September 25 from the Wuzhai Missile and Space Test Centre also known as the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre in Shanxi province, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported quoting US media reports.
The first flight test of an upgraded mobile intercontinental ballistic missile in the lead-up to National Day aimed to show the world that China was reinforcing its nuclear deterrent, it quoted military experts as saying.
The DF-31B is an upgraded version of the DF-31A and the launch was at least the second time the PLA's Second Artillery Corps had tested a DF-31 missile in the past three months.
In late July, the PLA conducted a flight test of a DF-31A in what was the fourth known flight test of that missile in two years, it said.
The DF-31 system has an estimated range of nearly 10,000 kms, enough to deliver a nuclear warhead to the capitals of Europe or the west coast of the US.
The mobile missiles are designed specifically for travel over rugged terrain and in difficult road conditions.
Xu Guangyu, a Beijing-based retired PLA major general said the strategic aim of the test is "Beijing just wants to increase China's military might and its nuclear strategic threat. It's not really targeting the US or other countries".
"China needs to conduct intensive weapons tests and military drills because the (US-led build-up) now in the Asia-Pacific area is not good for Beijing," he told the Post.
Earlier state media reports said Beijing would roll out the Dongfeng-41, a system designed to have a range of 12,000 kms, allowing it to hit targets anywhere in the US.
Xu said the US' "pivot to Asia" and its plan to send 60 per cent of its military force to the region by 2020 had put pressure on Beijing to step up missile development.
"It's normal for China to develop other, more advanced missiles given that a weapon cycle is between five and seven years, and the DF-31A was delivered to the PLA in 2006," he said.
Macau-based military expert Antony Wong Dong said it was hard to tell the difference between the DF-31A and DF-31B, but the upgraded version might have better performance.
"The DF-31A was designed to carry three warheads. I think the new DF-31B is possibly a multi-warhead version with higher accuracy," Wong said.
In January, PLA Daily posted 17 photos of a live drill of the DF-31A on its website, the first public glimpse of the advanced weapon.
The PLA also tested a hypersonic vehicle, the Wu-14, on August 7 in Shanxi. The launch failed despite a successful first test in January, the Post report said.

Indian-origin Stanford professor wins top US...Barack Obama
(Born in 1935 to a Malayalam-speaking…)
WASHINGTON: A 79-year-old Indian-American Stanford University professor is among 10 innovators to receive US National Medal of Science announced by President Barack Obama for their contribution to the field of science.
Pune-graduate and Padma Bhushan recipient Thomas Kailath will receive the United States' highest honour for achievement and leadership in advancing the fields of science at a White House ceremony later this year.
"These scholars and innovators have expanded our understanding of the world, made invaluable contributions to their fields, and helped improve countless lives," Obama was quoted as saying by National Science Foundation, a US government agency, yesterday.
Awarded annually, the medal recognises individuals who have made outstanding contributions to science and engineering.
Born in 1935 to a Malayalam-speaking Syrian Christian family who hailed from Kerala, Kailath has authored several books including well-known Linear Systems.
After graduating from the University of Pune in 1956, Kailath received his Master's degree and his doctorate degree in 1961, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology US. He was the first India-born student to receive a doctorate in electrical engineering from MIT.
He joined Stanford University as Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering in 1963 and was promoted to Professor in 1968, and was appointed the first holder of the Hitachi America Professorship in 1988.
He is also known for his contributions to the information and system sciences.

Timing of Chinese incursion with Xi visit a mystery: AirchiefPrint
Raha said that a fighter aircraft base is coming up at Nyoma in Ladakh, but added that the project would take about five years to be completed.
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 6:14 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 3:44 pm
The Chinese incursion into Ladakh and the way the episode had coincided with the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India was a “mystery”, IAF chief Arup Raha said on Saturday even as he stressed that Indian forces were not yielding any ground at the border.
“It’s been always a mystery the way incursions take place and the way they get timed with various visits… It’s nothing new, it remains a mystery for all of us.
“You all know that in diplomacy a lot of signalling is done, especially so with our northern neighbour. It could be part of some signalling to my mind. But I am not going to guess what it really means,” he said at an interaction ahead of Indian Air Force’s 82nd anniversary celebrations on Oct. 8.
However, making it clear that India was “not giving ground to anyone”, Raha blamed the frequent face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control on differences of perception between the two countries over the actual position.
“There are differences in perception as to where is the LAC… This is leading to face-offs. However, our security forces are following policies… We are not giving ground to anyone,” he said.
Meanwhile, referring to the measures being taken to build military infrastructure along the border with China, Raha said that a fighter aircraft base is coming up at Nyoma in Ladakh, but added that the project would take about five years to be completed.
Another base would come up in Kargil, he said, adding that the funds will be released soon for it. “These bases are strategically important for us and will improve our capabilities,” he said. Upgrade of six airfields in the northeast is also being carried out and the work will be completed by the end of 2015. That would allow air force to operate fixed wing aircraft from there for swifter force mobilisation, Raha said.

Back-up husbands  emotional affairs and the sudden rise of digital infidelityBy Caitlin Dewey October 3 Follow @caitlindewey

As if the negotiation of Facebook officiality and the drawn-out dance of flirty texting weren’t obstacles enough, the Internet has visited a new affliction on modern love: It’s called “digital infidelity,” and it’s probably living on your phone.
A new study by researchers at the University of Indiana found that Facebook users in relationships frequently use the site to keep in touch with “back-burners” — exes or platonic friends they know they could connect with romantically, should their current relationships go south. Men have back-burners at roughly twice the rate of women, the study found. But among both genders, the practice is widespread: On average, respondents in relationships said they had romantic or sexual conversations with two people (!) besides their current partner.
That comes on top of a a recent release by the research agency OnePoll, which suggested as many as half of all women keep in touch with a “back-up husband” they could contact if their current husband doesn’t work out. (“With sites like Facebook and Twitter, it’s easier than ever to stay in touch with an old flame,” a OnePoll rep told the Daily Mail .)
Meanwhile, sex researchers have recently begun to treat “remote infidelity” — emotional cheating, via social media or smartphone — as a valid topic of research. And it’s on the rise, the noted relationship scholar and anthropology professor Helen Fisher told Salon .
“If you’re rushing away from the dinner table with your family to check your e-mail,” Fisher said, “it’s affecting your relationship.”
… and these days, who doesn’t check their e-mail at dinner ?
At some level, this idea of “digital cheating” or “remote infidelity” is just a very old concept in new, trendy clothes. People in relationships have always had back-burners, the Indiana researchers point out — and emotional infidelity, a sort of destructive, unconsummated affair, went down in bars and over cubicle walls long before we had Gchat records of it. To some extent, the Internet has only made these things more visible, better-documented: There are finally texts and emails to back up our suspicions.
But there are other things going on here, as well. Conversing by text or direct message is so inherently one-to-one, and so impossibly easy, that the technology lends a kind of intimacy to its contents — a text can be sent from anywhere, with anyone around, and no one else will know what it says.
(Pew)
And then, of course, there’s that much-discussed specter of the online dating industry : the dual blessing and curse of choice. Multiple studies have demonstrated that people who use social media and cellphones have much larger personal networks than people who do not — about a third larger, on average, Pew found in 2011. And on top of those existing connections, the Internet represents a previously unavailable, untapped source of endless new connections, endless choices.
That’s critical, because the strength of a relationship relies on three things , broadly speaking: satisfaction, emotional investment, and the availability of alternative partners. And that is, this new research suggests, exactly what social media promises — not constant temptation, exactly, but the constant, casual reminder that alternatives exist. Several years ago, when I first met my boyfriend, I remember being wildly offended by a particularly cynical, loud-mouthed acquaintance who mansplained relationships as a kind of mutual settling: “He’s the best you can get, and you’re the best he can get.”
“That’s a really grim take on humanity,” I assured him.
But in terms of social science, there’s actually some truth to that take (… even if it doesn’t, to my relief, totally explain a relationship’s success or failure). The existence of other potential partners changes the core economics of a relationship. And so you become aware of the options, both yours and your partner’s. You become aware of how many times he posts to exes’ Facebook walls, the average time it takes him to text back his female friends, the fact that you’ve fallen out of his Snapchat “top friends,” replaced by his brother-in-law and two women you’ve never met.
And by “you,” of course, I actually mean “me” — because like most honest, Internet-connected humans, I’ve experienced these feelings, too.
(mCouple)
Some companies think they’ve found a solution to this kind of digital-age unease: In fact, an entire creepy, terrifying industry exists around spying on your partner’s digital activity. There is software to log his or her e-mails and text messages; apps to tell you where his phone is; parental control software to tell you which websites she browses.
“You and your partner are madly in love and want to be closer than ever before?” asks mCouple , an app that lets you view every text, call and Facebook messages sent from your partner’s phone. “mCouple is a mobile tracker that can help you stay in touch 24/7!”
That kind of vigilance, it turns out, is probably unnecessary. (Not to mention, pretty unhealthy/weird). It’s counterintuitive, perhaps, but the Indiana University researchers found no correlation between the existence of Facebook back-burners and your partner’s commitment to the relationship. So digital infidelity, much like sexting and going “Facebook official,” might be just another wrinkle in modern love these days.

In Baramati, the home turf of the Pawars, it rarely happens that a member of the first family faces vociferous protests during a public rally. But on Thursday, Sunetra Pawar, wife of former deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar, had to leave her rally in Baramati mid-way after the crowd hurled a volley of questions on development and infrastructure at her. A day later, she talks to Manoj More about what exactly happened, and why her husband won’t campaign in Baramati, the Assembly constituency from where he is contesting.
There were reports that somebody hurled stones at you at Thursday’s rally in Dheklewadi
No, that’s not true. There were protests by four-five youths when I went to address a rally. As I was addressing the crowd, they raised their voice. I found it difficult to speak amid the din. We then left the place.
What was the immediate provocation?
I heard that some Dhangar Kruti Samiti members were protesting. Maybe they wanted to score political points… this is a democracy and everyone has a right to protest. But except for protest by a handful of youths, nothing happened.
Weren’t there protests about lack of amenities in their area?
In Baramati, we have done so much work that there is hardly any room for complaints. Baramati does not lack public amenities. There is politics behind the protest and I have taken it in my stride.
Since you are Ajit’s campaign manager, what is your style of campaigning?
My major thrust is on door-to-door campaigning. We do hold corner meetings, but I feel a personal touch with voters is very important. We campaign mostly during morning and then for a few hours in the evening.
What do you promise voters?
We don’t have to promise voters anything. We never ask for votes. We just have to meet them. I greet them with folded hands and that’s about it. This is because we have provided all kinds of public amenities in Baramati. There is no public project that the Pawar family has not implemented.
How many rallies will Ajit address in Baramati?
There is no need for my husband to campaign in Baramati. I, scores of our relatives and party supporters are taking care of his campaign.
So he will not visit Baramati at all?
He inaugurated the election campaign and now he will address the concluding election rally. This is our tradition in Baramati. My husband won’t campaign here. Instead, he will tour the entire state and campaign for other NCP candidates.
How do you think your husband will fare?
All voters in Baramati are our relatives…We don’t have to worry about the outcome.
What do you feel about the allegations levelled against your husband?
Any human being would get hurt when baseless allegations are being discussed. But I know this is all politics. If you are in politics, you should be prepared to face such situations. It doesn’t worry my husband as well.
Does he get time to himself?
No, not at all. He wakes up at 5.30 am and gets on with this work. He does not go continued…

 US Jobless Rate at 6-year Low of 5.9%You are here: Home Economy
US Jobless Rate Lowest in Six Years; Dollar Rises

Government to Streamline Subsidies, Cheap LPG for Rich May Go: Finance Minister
London: A strong improvement in the US jobs market lifted the dollar to a four-year high against a basket of currencies on Friday while stocks also extended gains, taking heart from more evidence of a sustained recovery in the world's largest economy.
Closely followed non-farm payrolls data for September showed US employers had added 248,000 jobs, up from an upwardly revised 180,000 the previous month and beating forecasts of the 215,000 economists polled by Reuters had predicted beforehand. The jobless rate fell to a six-year low of 5.9 per cent.
Wall Street futures extended gains while the dollar hit a fresh four-year high of 86.498. US short-term interest-rate futures contracts fell and traders boosted bets the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates slightly earlier in 2015.
"Just when investors had been becoming nervous about global growth prospects with October so far seeing a broad sell-off in equity markets, today's non-farm payrolls figure could put a line in the sand for the indices," said Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FXPro.
This week has seen stocks, oil and other commodity markets suffer their biggest slump in months on worries about growth, political unrest and looming US interest rate rises and their impact on the dollar.
Dollar bulls, who have pushed the currency to a four-year high this week, had been counting on the robust jobs report following some healthy signals already this week.
Brent crude futures fell to $92.20 a barrel, trading near their lowest since 2012, with the overall tone quite bearish, amid ample supply.
Gold fell 1.3 per cent to a nine-month low of $1,197.95/oz while copper prices ticked up after hitting five-month lows the session before.
European bourses extended their earlier gains, rising 1 per cent.
The euro fell to a two-year low against the dollar, a day after the European Central Bank disappointed the markets on Thursday and triggered the biggest sell-off in over a year in markets like Italy.

The stock market stabilizes. (Sal Ruibal, USA TODAY)
Just when it looked like the U.S. stock market was going to crack amid the pressure of a new array of risks, it found its footing and stabilized thanks to a handful of factors that acted like shock absorbers for the market.
Just three days ago, on the first day of October, a month that spooks investors because of stock market crashes in October 1929 and 1987, stocks were in free fall. Wall Street was buzzing about how far stocks could fall — and whether the benchmark S&P 500-stock index was finally on a collision course with its first 10% drop, or correction, since late 2011.
The world — and the stock market — appeared in chaos and disarray as a confluence of scary headlines rattled the nerves of even the most ardent Wall Street bulls, prompting a 238-point plunge Wednesday in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong seemed on the verge of spinning out of control. The U.S. announced its first-ever diagnosis of Ebola on home soil. The small-cap Russell 2000 stock index — a bull market leader the past five years — fell 10% below its early March all-time high and into official “correction” territory. And weak manufacturing readings in Germany and the rest of the eurozone sparked fears of a global growth slowdown.
Fast-forward to today and the stock market appears far more stable, with stocks turning sharply higher amid fresh signs that the U.S. labor market — and the broader economy — may be in solid shape after all.
In early trading Friday, the Dow was up more than 140 points to 16,941, after climbing as much as 150 points earlier in the session. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.9% to 1964 and the Nasdaq was up 1.2% to 4483.
What caused the tone of the market to flip from bearish to bullish virtually overnight? Here are five factors that have acted as shock absorbers for the fragile market at a pivotal time.
1. Blowout jobs report. Any concerns that the U.S. job-creation machine was stalling out went by the wayside Friday when the government released its September jobs report.
The U.S. economy created 248,000 jobs last month, topping forecasts of 215,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The unemployment rate declined to 5.9% — the lowest level since July 2008 — and better than the 6.1% forecast.
The government also revised up the weak August jobs report to 180,000 jobs from 142,000, and July job gains to 243,000 from 212,000. However, worker pay didn’t budge, as average hourly wage gains were unchanged. That signals that wage inflation remains tame, which is a bullish sign for stocks as it gives the Federal Reserve some ammunition to argue that speeding up the timetable for interest rate hikes might not be necessary, despite the strong reading on the labor market.
The upbeat jobs report also shows that the economy is not falling off a cliff and is still strong enough to support solid corporate earnings growth despite slowdowns in Europe and China.
“This morning there is a sigh of relief on both Wall Street and Main Street,” says Sung Won Sohn, a finance professor at California State University CI. “The jobs slowdown in August was an aberration and the economy is back on a healthier growth trajectory.”
2. Hong Kong protests don’t cause meltdown. The pro-democracy protests have not spiraled out of control, despite the ongoing standoff between the China-backed Hong Kong government and protesters. In fact, the size of the street protests appeared to be dwindling Friday after the Hong Kong government agreed to talks with the protesters. What’s more, the key Hang Seng stock index rose 0.6% to 23,064.56 Friday after steep selloffs earlier in the week and after markets were closed for two days for holidays tied to China’s independence 65 years ago.
Investors viewed both developments in Asia as a sign that the protests might not spiral out of control as feared and morph into an economic crisis.
3. Small-cap stocks rebound. Market pessimism peaked Wednesday when the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index closed down more than 10% from its March 4 record high of 1208.65, putting it into official correction territory. However, the small-cap index mounted a 1% rebound Thursday and is up another 1% today.
The rebound in what is considered a proxy for risk-taking on Wall Street suggests that the buy-the-dip mentality on Wall Street is not dead. It also downplayed fears that the small-cap selloff was going to drag down the broader market.
4. Ebola, a scare, but not a crisis. The first diagnosed case of the deadly Ebola virus in the U.S. has dragged down shares of airlines and other travel-related stocks, but Wall Street is still not treating the scare as a major economic crisis — at least not yet. Markets typically don’t sell off sharply unless there is a clear sign that a health-related epidemic has real, lasting negative economic impact.
5. Seasonally strong time of year. The stock market is heading into its strongest seasonal three-month and six-month periods of the year, so investors are giving the market the benefit of the doubt for now. The bulls on Wall Street still argue that the economy and labor market are strong, which should translate into solid performance for corporate profitability, a key underpinning of the stock market rally the past five years.

India's air traffic grows, IATA credits 'supportive' govt
India's domestic Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), which measures actual passenger traffic, grew 7.4 per cent over August last year, almost matching the 7.6 per cent rise in Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) that indicates available passenger capacity or the number of aircraft seats available.

India's air traffic grows, IATA credits 'supportive' govt
India's domestic Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), which measures actual passenger traffic, grew 7.4 per cent over August last year, almost matching the 7.6 per cent rise in Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) that indicates available passenger capacity or the number of aircraft seats available.
Post your opinion here
 
Reflecting "solid" growth over the past two months, India's domestic passenger traffic rose 7.4
per cent in August, recording the second highest growth rate globally after Russia's 10 percent, latest IATA data shows.
"Indian domestic demand climbed 7.4 percent. Results for the last two months have been solid, perhaps an early sign of improvement as a result of the new business-supportive
government regime," the analysis of the data by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said.
India's domestic Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), which measures actual passenger traffic, grew 7.4 per cent over August last year, almost matching the 7.6 per cent rise in Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) that indicates available passenger capacity or the number of aircraft seats available.
The overall average domestic demand rose 4.5 percent in August compared to August 2013 with all markets reporting growth, led by Russia and India, the analysis said. Like India, Russia's high growth rate of 10.1 percent showed that the airlines there "have been able to  stimulate domestic demand through significant fare reductions", it said.
The international air traffic results showed a "slight pick-up in demand" in August over the previous month.
Airlines in the Asia Pacific region saw their global traffic rise 5.8 percent in August compared to the previous year. While seat capacity rose by seven per cent, their load factor declined 0.9 percentage points to 81 per cent.
Middle East region saw the strongest year-on-year traffic growth at 11.7 per cent as airlines there continued to "benefit from the strength of regional economies and solid growth in business-related premium travel."
Commenting on the air traffic data, IATA Director General and CEO Tony Tyler said, "August was a good month right across the industry. All regions reported an expansion in demand for
air travel" with high load factors.
"We should, however, keep an eye on potential downside risks," he said pointing towards European continent's "increasingly worrying economic outlook".

Back-up husbandsBy Caitlin Dewey October 3 Follow @caitlindewey

As if the negotiation of Facebook officiality and the drawn-out dance of flirty texting weren’t obstacles enough, the Internet has visited a new affliction on modern love: It’s called “digital infidelity,” and it’s probably living on your phone.
A new study by researchers at the University of Indiana found that Facebook users in relationships frequently use the site to keep in touch with “back-burners” — exes or platonic friends they know they could connect with romantically, should their current relationships go south. Men have back-burners at roughly twice the rate of women, the study found. But among both genders, the practice is widespread: On average, respondents in relationships said they had romantic or sexual conversations with two people (!) besides their current partner.
That comes on top of a a recent release by the research agency OnePoll, which suggested as many as half of all women keep in touch with a “back-up husband” they could contact if their current husband doesn’t work out. (“With sites like Facebook and Twitter, it’s easier than ever to stay in touch with an old flame,” a OnePoll rep told the Daily Mail .)
Meanwhile, sex researchers have recently begun to treat “remote infidelity” — emotional cheating, via social media or smartphone — as a valid topic of research. And it’s on the rise, the noted relationship scholar and anthropology professor Helen Fisher told Salon .
“If you’re rushing away from the dinner table with your family to check your e-mail,” Fisher said, “it’s affecting your relationship.”
… and these days, who doesn’t check their e-mail at dinner ?
At some level, this idea of “digital cheating” or “remote infidelity” is just a very old concept in new, trendy clothes. People in relationships have always had back-burners, the Indiana researchers point out — and emotional infidelity, a sort of destructive, unconsummated affair, went down in bars and over cubicle walls long before we had Gchat records of it. To some extent, the Internet has only made these things more visible, better-documented: There are finally texts and emails to back up our suspicions.
But there are other things going on here, as well. Conversing by text or direct message is so inherently one-to-one, and so impossibly easy, that the technology lends a kind of intimacy to its contents — a text can be sent from anywhere, with anyone around, and no one else will know what it says.
(Pew)
And then, of course, there’s that much-discussed specter of the online dating industry : the dual blessing and curse of choice. Multiple studies have demonstrated that people who use social media and cellphones have much larger personal networks than people who do not — about a third larger, on average, Pew found in 2011. And on top of those existing connections, the Internet represents a previously unavailable, untapped source of endless new connections, endless choices.
That’s critical, because the strength of a relationship relies on three things , broadly speaking: satisfaction, emotional investment, and the availability of alternative partners. And that is, this new research suggests, exactly what social media promises — not constant temptation, exactly, but the constant, casual reminder that alternatives exist. Several years ago, when I first met my boyfriend, I remember being wildly offended by a particularly cynical, loud-mouthed acquaintance who mansplained relationships as a kind of mutual settling: “He’s the best you can get, and you’re the best he can get.”
“That’s a really grim take on humanity,” I assured him.
But in terms of social science, there’s actually some truth to that take (… even if it doesn’t, to my relief, totally explain a relationship’s success or failure). The existence of other potential partners changes the core economics of a relationship. And so you become aware of the options, both yours and your partner’s. You become aware of how many times he posts to exes’ Facebook walls, the average time it takes him to text back his female friends, the fact that you’ve fallen out of his Snapchat “top friends,” replaced by his brother-in-law and two women you’ve never met.
And by “you,” of course, I actually mean “me” — because like most honest, Internet-connected humans, I’ve experienced these feelings, too.
(mCouple)
Some companies think they’ve found a solution to this kind of digital-age unease: In fact, an entire creepy, terrifying industry exists around spying on your partner’s digital activity. There is software to log his or her e-mails and text messages; apps to tell you where his phone is; parental control software to tell you which websites she browses.
“You and your partner are madly in love and want to be closer than ever before?” asks mCouple , an app that lets you view every text, call and Facebook messages sent from your partner’s phone. “mCouple is a mobile tracker that can help you stay in touch 24/7!”
That kind of vigilance, it turns out, is probably unnecessary. (Not to mention, pretty unhealthy/weird). It’s counterintuitive, perhaps, but the Indiana University researchers found no correlation between the existence of Facebook back-burners and your partner’s commitment to the relationship. So digital infidelity, much like sexting and going “Facebook official,” might be just another wrinkle in modern love these days.

Sonia slams BJP over  false promises  in electionsSonia slams BJP over  false promises  in elections
Haryana poll: Sonia hits out at ModiThe Hindu Congress President Sonia Gandhi and the Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda during rally at Maham,dist Rohtak,Haryana on Saturday. - Photo:Sandeep Saxena
Meham (Rohtak), Oct 4:  
In a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi today said the new government was behaving as if governments since independence have done nothing for the country and asked him what happened to his promise of bringing back black money.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence and they will change everyone’s fortunes overnight. Have any steps been taken to fulfil the promises made during the elections.
”...What happened to their promise of getting back the black money from abroad within 100 days of coming to power.
Have any steps been taken in this regard? Absolutely not,” Gandhi said at a rally here, hours after Modi urged voters in Haryana to oust the Congress.
“A country is not built in a day’s time. For the development of a nation it takes years of hard work, the right intention and the willingness to sacrifice,” she said.
Accusing Modi government of hijacking policies of previous Congress regimes, she urged the people not to get swayed by “hollow promises” and said that Congress was the only party which would ensure that development continues in Haryana.
“At the time of the elections, I urge you to take a decision after listening to your brain and not your heart. To seek votes they try to play with your emotions, may hollow promises. Beware of such designs,” the Congress President said.
“Those who lure people with their false dreams only to secure power have nothing to do with progress or people of the state,” she said.
She also accused the ruling BJP of rechristening the schemes of the UPA and presented them before people, after having criticised the same schemes during UPA regime.
Gandhi also urged people of the state to elect the Congress once again to ensure speedy progress and to take forward the development initiated by the party in the last 10 years for it to be cited as an example across the country.
“Congress is not such a party which believes in presenting others’ works as its own,” she said.
Praising the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government for ushering in all—round development in various spheres of life, she said, “In the last 10 years, Congress party has laid a strong foundation for the state’s progress and will take it forward on the path of development in the next five years...Only Congress party can do this work of initiating development.”
She also attacked the BJP and INLD for indulging in “caste politics”.

Enthusiasm created by  Swachh Bharat  should be kept going: PM Modi27

New Delhi: Two days after launching the 'Swachh Bharat' campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the momentum of "enthusiasm" generated by the drive should be kept going for the success of the mission.
He also expressed happiness over former prime minister HD Deve Gowda joining the ambitious campaign.
"I am very happy to see the enthusiasm for Swachh Bharat Mission. We must keep this momentum going for the success of the Mission," Modi said a tweet.
Modi himself wielded the broom on October 2 as he launched the 'Clean India' campaign.
#narendra modi #swachh bharat #clean india #hd deve gowda
"Am glad that former PM Shri HD Deve Gowda ji joined Swachh Bharat Mission. A very strong gesture," he added in another tweet.
Soon after Modi's call for 'Swachh Bharat' campaign on Thursday, Deve Gowda took a broom and swept the Hassan railway station in Karnataka.
Modi himself wielded the broom on October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, as he launched the 'Clean India' campaign, joined by chief ministers, lawmakers, prominent personalities from various fields along with lakhs of countrymen in a drive that is expected to cost nearly Rs 2 lakh crore.
Asserting that "Swachh Bharat" mission is "beyond politics" and inspired by "patriotism", he had invoked Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a "clean and developed" India as he formally kicked off the five-year-long campaign, which will cover 4,041 statutory towns, on the 145th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation.

Beed (Maharashtra): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday started his Maharashtra campaign trail in Beed, the bastion of late BJP leader Gopinath Munde. While addressing an election rally, he slammed the former Congress-NCP government and accused them of corruption and ignoring the interests of the people of the state.
Modi said, "The gotra (clan) of Congress and NCP is same. Their habits, culture and goals are same. They aren't rashtravadi (nationalist) but bhrashtacharvadi (corrupt)."
He added, "Amitabh Bachchan hosts 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' on TV, Congress plays Kaun Banega Arabpati in Maharashtra."

As the state was ruled by many chief ministers in last 10 years, Modi hit out at the former government saying, "They kept changing chief ministers and many people fulfilled their dream of becoming CM, but not even a single dream of a common Maharashtrian was fulfilled."
Modi hit back at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi for accusing his government of not fulfilling poll promises, saying those seeking account of his performance in four months in power, have done little in the last 60 years.
Modi said,"They want an account of my work...what have they done in the past 60 years. Give me 60 months and I will pull the country out of the troubles," he said.
The state will go for Assembly elections on October 15 and bypoll to the Beed Lok Sabha seat will also be held on the same day. The bypoll was necessitated following the death of Union Minister Munde in a road mishap in Delhi soon after the Modi government came to power.
The Prime Minister also sought complete majority for the BJP in the state, saying the party was required for development.
He said while 3,700 farmers commit suicide in the state annually, the UPA government in Delhi failed to provide them with water for irrigation.

Recalling Munde's leadership, he said had the late BJP leader been alive, there was no need for him to come to Beed for election rally.
The BJP is not contesting the Assembly polls with its previous ally Shiv Sena as the two parted ways recently.

Happily ever after, desi style
PREETHI ZACHARIAH
books and literature
I discovered the world of cheesy romances at the impressionable age of 13 . It was an innocent-looking ragged, red-bound book with the rather questionable title of Stay Through the Night (I’m sure the cover page had been ripped off by some conservative librarian). I stayed up all through that night reading it. And I was hooked.
I’m not sure what makes them work — is it the image of a wild-haired woman dressed in a low-necked outfit that threatens to slide off her shoulder, clinging to the tall, Byronic hero in his pristine white, open-necked shirt and tight pants that leave little to the imagination? It is as clichéd as clichés go, but it does have its takers.
The romance is formulaic — if you’ve read 10, you’ve read them all. Innocent young woman meets jaded rake who cannot help but fall for her understated charm. The rake, a big guy (in more ways than one), is impossibly suave, extremely well-to-do, terribly tortured and oh-so-very exotic. He is the Italian painter, the Arab sheikh, the French diplomat, the British sailor, the Australian writer — basically the quintessential alpha male, out to conquer the world and every woman in it. Then he meets the heroine, a straggling wall-flower of sorts, pretty in a subdued way but very different from the calculative, ostentatious beauties he has been privy to before. And this unnerves him — he wants her but doesn’t want to face it. And she wants him back but he frightens her so she tells herself she dislikes him.
The mutual striving by both parties to overcome their attraction, despite the sparks that fly whenever their eyes/hands/any other body parts touch, takes up most of the novel. The climax is hugely predictable — the earlier novels stop at a cataclysmic kiss, while the latter ones lead to an intense sexual encounter, which is followed by the big let-down/disappointment/unpleasant revelation that results in a terrible lovers’ tiff and a vow to never see the other again.
They do of course — the twain does meet, true love conquers all, the happily-ever-after happens. And despite the essential absurdness of it all, the formula works beautifully.
The Mills & Boon brand, which was acquired by Harlequin Enterprises in 1971, has been regaling women in more than a hundred countries, for over a century now. And just five years ago, they also set up shop in India. While the classic formula remains the same, the new series of M&B novels flooding the Indian market is being dished out with a generous dose of desi tadka. According to Amrita Chowdhury, country head and publishing director, Harlequin India, “Readers want stories that speak to them. Of course, the appeal of the global M&B is of exotic locales and intense, passionate romances, and that continues to have a strong appeal amid loyal readers in India. With the Indian M&B, we hope to get new readers who prefer stories told in an Indian way.”
Milan Vohra, a former advertising professional who wrote The Love Asana, the first Indian M&B title, saysthis shift was long overdue. “Generations of Indian women I knew had read Mills & Boon with foreign characters. I had grown up with an occasional helping or two of M&Bs. Personally, I never found the counts and dukes and marquis and sheikhs I read about too exciting. They were too far removed. So the notion of being the first to write an Indian M&B with Indian protagonists and settings gave me a great buzz.”
“Also, yes, while endearments like mia cara and querido, mi amor, ma belle in M&Bs had tickled my fantasies as a teenaged reader, it was even more exciting that I could give readers that same sense of wonder by writing about so many of our rich romantic traditions, the poetry of Indian lyrics, the sensuousness of many of our rituals.”
This new brand of desi romances defines romance itself very differently — the Western notion of individuality and space, merges with the Indian dependence on family and community approval. Shoma Narayanan, who has written five of these desi romances, says, “My Indian readers, whether based in India or overseas, identify with the characters in the books, and with the familiar settings and cultural norms. As for International readers, my books give them a glimpse into a culture that they’re unfamiliar with, and that’s the main draw for them.”
Zoya Shah, a self-confessed bibliophile who claims to adore fairy-tale romances, says, “I picked up Indian M&Bs because I was looking forward to the Indian setting, but honestly, apart from the names and the elaborate marriage rituals, I could have been reading a generic M&B romance. They didn’t vary too much from the traditional format — though there were references to quintessentially Indian things like slums, yoga and the Mumbai rains — and I enjoyed reading them.”
Amrita agrees. “We are trying to indigenise the stories, of course, but keeping in line with the basic M&B premise, these books feature Indian heroines who are usually bankers, engineers, doctors, PR executives, teachers, supermodels and so on, while Indian heroes tend to be successful hoteliers, Bollywood stars, venture capitalists, or entrepreneurs, and the story revolves around their romance,” she says, adding, “There is a definite progression towards making the characters mainstream and identifiable. The girls tend to be independent working women, who could be making their lives and careers in the city. Whether families live close by or faraway, they tend to play an important role in the story.”
“In fact, this strong presence of families is where the Indian books branch away from the Western ones.”
Talking about her novel, Milan says, “My book doesn’t exoticise India. It reflects a real country through the food, clothes, ceremonies, relationships and settings — both the extremely affluent and middle-class parts of Delhi.”
“My heroine Pari is like so many inspiring women I’ve met, who hide their vulnerabilities and hopes while they take on the world. A small-town girl and a strong person in her own right, she earns the hero’s admiration and love through her own intellect, compassion and self respect.”
Though often touted as regressive and misogynistic, Shoma believes that this is not strictly true and the genre — both the Indian and International versions — has changed with the times. “Mills & Boon books have evolved to keep pace with the changing role of women in society. For instance, the plots now focus more on conflicts between the personalities of the leading characters rather than external factors such as jealous ex-girlfriends or tyrannical parents. The women are feisty and independent — they have successful careers of their own, and are not afraid to stand up for themselves. The heroes are more modern and less caveman-like but they’re still drop-dead gorgeous alpha males.”
And I’m not complaining about it.

Neel Mukherjee on making the Booker shortlist, the theoretical underpinning of his novel and the difficult road to vegetarianism
Neel Mukherjee is in town, and we have been informed that he is a vegetarian. Our search for an appropriate venue ends at Chutney in The Metropolitan Hotel, where we decide to meet for lunch.
The afternoon is heavy with languor, a feeling accentuated somewhat by the silence in the restaurant. Neel arrives, looking a little harried, and is a little uncomfortable with the staff's overtures to begin with. He protests gently when informed that the chef has prepared a special meal for us, but after tasting the first of the preparations, the tamatar tulsi shorba, he appears pacified.
It is only a couple of weeks until the winner of the Booker Prize is announced, but Neel is anything but nervous. His novel “The Lives of Others” is shortlisted alongside works by Ali Smith, Howard Jacobson, Karen Joy Fowler, Richard Flanagan and Joshua Ferris. “I think it’s just great to be on the shortlist because I’m only two books old. I am thrilled, delighted and I am shell-shocked. It’s like I’ve been hit in the back of my head and I’m still seeing the stars,” he says of his achievement.
The novel, his second after the Crossword Book Award winning “Past Continuous”, is set in the years between 1967 and 1970, when West Bengal was in the throes of Naxalism. The locus of its action, however, is 22/6 Basanta Bose Road, Calcutta, where the lives of three generations of the once-prosperous Ghosh family are slowly coming apart.
The novel unfolds in episodes that take the point of view of each of these characters (detailing in the process their secrets, perversions, jealousies and the larger, claustrophobic “opera of Bengali life”), as well as a series of letters from Supratik, the eldest grandson of the family, who has left unannounced to join the Naxal movement.
While it is tempting to call the novel a family saga, which it is, Neel’s intentions were of a different order. “I started thinking about the realist novel...And if you look at the novel form, its origins and its development are so tied up with a particular class — the bourgeoisie,” Neel says. “The realist novel throughout its history has held up a kind of mirror to this class to make the world either comprehensible or palatable to them.”
The novel emerged from this thinking, and as a consequence of Neel’s effort to bring it to bear on form. In this endeavour, the words of the writer M John Harrison – “start with a form, then ask what it's afraid of” – became his map. “I thought it could become the core of a writer’s project – asking of a genre what it is hiding, what it is colluding in, what it is not doing,” Neel explains. “I thought if one has to write a novel to lay bare the ideological foundations of the bourgeois realist novel, one has to do it dialectically. So therefore I thought it wouldn’t do just to write the story of a family, I would have to have an antithetical ideology.”
Apart from a political project, Neel also imagined the novel as a linguistic one. It was important to him, he says, to convey the habits of mind and patterns of speech of his Bengali characters, even if they did not make full sense to a non-Bengali reader. “It is my big Bengali novel,” he says proudly.
Conversation is interrupted by the arrival of the kabab platters, with a paneer dilnaaz tikka, a palak seekh, a mewe aur mawa ki galawat and a makai matar kabab each, and we resume with the subject of vegetarianism, to which the writer converted recently. Until he read “The Lives of Animals” by J.M. Coetzee, Neel had “no idea that there could be such a concept as the moral right and wrong of eating animals”. It took him a few more years to take the plunge into vegetarianism, though, because his “Bengali greed got in the way”. Perhaps for the same reason, he still hasn’t been able to give up fish – an inconsistency he hopes to correct soon.
Holding the note of regret a little longer (this time in Bengali, where it acquires a comic inflection), Neel says, “I am greedy. I think about food all the time, about lunch after breakfast, about dinner after lunch. My life seems to be structured around food.” The self-awareness doesn’t sully his appreciation of the main course, though, which features khumb makhana curry, soya bean ka khagina, khada palak makai and subz biryani. Neel is particularly appreciative of the biryani and the soya bean preparation. Sated with the meal, we decide to forego the dessert – the gulab jamun sandwich, which manages to sound forbidding and welcoming at once.
Being a vegetarian hasn’t been difficult for Neel, but “if one could eat like this every day it would become easier,” he chuckles, and we take leave of each other.

In Satara  its dynasty that decidesIn Satara, it’s dynasty that decides

Although dynastic politics took a drubbing during the Lok Sabha polls, elections in western Maharashtra’s Maratha heartland of Satara continue to be a family business.
In a majority of the region’s eight Assembly segments, the contest for the upcoming state polls would be decided by a clash between rival political dynasties rather than between rival parties.
Given the voters’ loyalty to dynasties, all parties have been liberal in giving election tickets to members of established political families.
The Shiv Sena and the BJP, which have limited presence in the region, have also adopted this strategy.
Interestingly, it was Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji’s descendent Udayanraje Bhosle, who halted Narendra Modi’s march in this belt, leading NCP to a resounding victory during the general elections. The sugar belt, which was the capital of Shivaji’s kingdom, has always been NCP’s mainstay. The NCP wrested four out of eight seats in the region during the 2009 Assembly polls, while Independents (3) and Congress (1) got the rest.
In Patan Assembly seat, the polls have been an affair between the Patankar and the Desai families for several decades. This time is no different. While the NCP has fielded sitting legislator and former public works department minister Vikramsinh Patankar’s son Satyajit, former Congress minister the late Balasaheb Desai’s son and former legislator Shambhuraj Desai is contesting on a Shiv Sena ticket for the fourth time.
Voters have remained loyal to both families even as they switched parties — Vikramsinh Patankar left Congress to join the NCP in 1999, while Desai left the Congress for the Sena in 1997. In fact, locals refer to local Shiv Sena workers as ‘Shambhusena’. Those backing the Patankars maintain that what they say matters more to them than what the NCP seniors say.
The race for Karad (North) Assembly seat is no different. It is a fight between the NCP’s Balasaheb Patil and the Congress’s Dhairyasheel Kadam. Patil, a three-time legislator, is the son former Congress heavyweight the late Pandurang Patil. Kadam too hails from a political dynasty. In 1999, Patil had contested as an Independent after being denied a ticket by the NCP, and won.
Former CM Prithviraj Chavan (Congress), who is the son of former Union minister Dajisaheb Chavan and former Congress state chief Premilakaki Chavan, will face BJP’s Atul Bhosale, who comes from the famous Mohite-Bhosle family, and seven-time legislator and Congress rebel Vilaskaka Undalkar (NCP) in Karad South.
Undalkar’s father was a renowned freedom fighter. While Undalkar, 77, has spent 35 years as a legislator, his family was in public life since much earlier. While Bhosale too has switched sides from the Congress, his supporters are confident that voters who have remained loyal to the family would remain with him.
Another Shivaji descendent, Shivendraraje Bhosale, continued…

Blame game over Patna stampede  BJP wants CM Manjhi to resignThe Dussehra-day stampede which killed 33 people in Patna  has set off a blame game with opposition BJP and other party leaders holding the state government responsible.

Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and  Ram Vilas Paswan demanded the resignation of chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, saying the tragedy happened because the administration had no system in place.
Describing the tragedy as "regrettable and shameful", Ravi Shankar Prasad said the state government miserably failed to learn from past incidents.
Read: ‘Poor lighting led to the tragedy'
"There was a stampede during Chhath puja in 2012 and bomb explosions during Narendra Modi's rally in October last year. Still no proper arrangements were made," he said.
Prasad said the Centre would extend all help to the state government to deal with the situation. "I have already spoken to home minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Harsh Vardhan. A team of NDRF has already left for Patna to assist the state administration," he added.
Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, hitting out at the JD(U) government said: "There was no security, no lighting, one gate was open while more than five lakh people were present there and the police were there only to rain lathis on the hapless people."
"This is not the first time it has happened. The state government is insensitive and solely responsible for this.  It took hours for them to react. I will submit a report to Union home minister and the prime minister once I return," he said.
Watch: Patna stampede toll rises to 33, centre seeks report
Even RJD leader Lalu Prasad who supports the Manjhi government said it was an "administrative lapse" and that there were no foolproof crowd control measures despite past incidents.
"The Gandhi Maidan stampede appears to be a matter of administrative lapse ( sic).  Stern action should be taken against officials found guilty. I am keeping a watch over the event," Prasad tweeted.
Prasad said the RJD had been demanding the boundary wall of the Gandhi Maidan should be lowered and that there should be more entry and exit points to the grounds.
The Bihar government  meanwhile constituted a two man committee consisting of  principal home secretary Amir Shubhani and additional director general, headquarters Gupteshwar Pandey to probe the reasons for the stampede.
The investigation report will be submitted to the government and the ministry of home affairs within 24 hours, officials said.

Patna MP Shatrughan Sinha criticised the district administration for improper preparations and demanded an impartial probe  to bring the guilty to book.
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Tariq Anwar too demanded strict action against the officials responsible for the stampede.
JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav assured strict action against those responsible. "The incident will be probed and those found guilty of laxity and carelessness will face strong action," he said.
Thirty three people were killed, all of them due to suffocation, and 29 others injured in the stampede that happened towards the end of the Dussehra day celebrations on Friday evening.
Of the dead, 21 were women, 10 were minors and two men, according to the list available at the Patna Medical College Hospital.

Ferraris iconic  headstrong boss of 23 years is stepping down. What next for the Prancing HorseLeo Mirani @lmirani
October 4, 2014
It is hard to overstate the impact of Luca Cordero di Montezemolo on Ferrari. In his time as chairman of the company, the famously stylish Montezemolo oversaw eight Formula 1 constructors’ world championships, and took the consumer brand from one that made what one analyst calls “a range of not very special cars in the late 1980s to the preeminent super-sportscar manufacturer of the decade.”
At the Paris Motor Show this week, Montezemolo displayed the 458 Speciale A, a 597-horsepower beast that is Ferrari’s most powerful car yet and the last of the automaker’s 458 series. It is also the last to roll out of the factory under the aegis of Montezemolo, who resigned —or was pushed out —from the company on Sept. 10. He will leave on Oct. 13.

Ferrari F355, 1994: “A very important car for Ferrari. Montezemolo wanted Ferraris to be useable, dependable and to be able to be driven by averagely skilled drivers without losing their visceral thrill. This car achieved that,” says Tim Urquhart, head auto analyst at IHS.(Ferrari S.p.A.)
The public version is that Montezemolo was asked to leave because of Formula 1 team’s miserable performance. The last time the team won a constructors’ championship was in 2008, and a drivers’ championship in 2007. Since then, the sport has been dominated by Red Bull  (and more recently, Mercedes). But there were other problems too.
Under Montezemolo, Ferrari has stagnated. He refused to build more than 7,000 cars every year in order to protect Ferraris’ exclusivity, and the Prancing Horse has remained steadfastly a supercar-maker rather than one that expanded to a wider range. Porsche, by contrast, now makes SUVs.

Yet Ferrari has “been quite happy to lend their name to quite tacky merchandise,” says Tim Urquhart, chief automotive analyst at IHS, a research firm. “You talk about protecting the brand mystique or whatever silly marketing phrase you want to use, I don’t see that as the way to go. I think they’d be better off making more cars personally.”
Urquhart points to Porsche, another storied luxury automaker that went from making some 70,000 cars a year a decade ago to double that this year without diluting its brand. (The five cars illustrating this story are Urquhart’s top five from the Montezemolo era.)

Sergio Marchionne, the CEO of Fiat, which owns most of Ferrari, has different ideas. This week Ferrari patented an engine that has many speculating that the company could make a foray into motorcycles, suggesting it could finally diversify into new segments. More changes are coming.
Indeed, it may have been only a matter of time before Montezemolo was shown the door. The company’s management had been shaken up recently, with a new CFO appointed last year and a new CTO earlier this year, with “very little contribution from Montezemolo,” according to an automotive analyst based in Milan. Marchionne has made it clear that he would increase the number of units sold every year. After all, the world’s population of super-rich is growing; the companies that cater to them need to change accordingly. The market would seem to agree; Fiat shares rose on news of Montezemolo’s departure last month.

Regardless of the direction Ferrari takes after his departure, Montezemolo legacy is secure: he turned Ferrari into a world-beating Formula 1 race team and its cars into some of the most sought after machines in the world. “Life is strange. Life makes surprises. It’s important for us to look ahead,” he said at the Paris Motor Show event on Thursday.

Modi hits campaign trail in Maharashtra  Haryana  asks voters to oust CongressComments
Five months after a highly successful Lok Sabha election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is back to doing what he does best — working the crowds, wooing them with his one-liners and boundless energy. His request: absolute majority for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana.

Kicking off his campaign for the October 15 assembly polls on Saturday, Modi slipped easily into his role of champion vote-seeker at his first rally of the day — in the northern state’s Karnal district. Accusing the ruling Congress and opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) of neglecting farmers and promoting goondaism, he appealed to voters to give the BJP a chance.
Alleging irregularities in land allotment, he asked, “Who among the poor has got a plot? ...But where have thousands of acres of land disappeared, who has taken this? Does Haryana want to settle the account?”
In a veiled attack on the INLD, he asked the people if they would like to be governed from jail. INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, serving a jail sentence in a corruption case but currently out on bail, had said he’d take oath as CM from Tihar.

Promising development and jobs, he hinted that Karnal may be part of his 100 smart cities project. And carrying forward his Swachh Bharat mission, he said, “We may be living in the age of Hi-Fi and Wi-Fi but safai (cleanliness) is equally important.”
Ending the day in Mumbai, he told a crowd at the Mahalaxmi Race Course, “Mumbai and Maharashtra’s growth is important for the country’s growth. I can’t leave Mumbai helpless any longer. The city is the birthplace of the BJP, which has achieved so much in such a short time.”
Attacking the ruling Congress and its ally, the NCP, but choosing to ignore former ally Shiv Sena, Modi said, “Amitabh Bachchan hosts a TV show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, but these Congress and NCP leaders have been playing Kaun Banega Arabpati all these years. Did 15 years of Congress-NCP government do any good to you, to farmers, to the poor?”
Watch: Modi, sounds poll bugle, tells Haryana voters to oust Congress
“Believe me, I can change Mumbai and Maharashtra. This is the city where most terrorist attacks happened, where most communal riots happened. Who is responsible? Do you not want to get rid of this?”
Earlier, in Beed and Aurangabad in drought-affected central Maharashtra, he appealed to voters to work towards a majority government of the BJP.
At each of his rallies, the PM also made it a point to recall his American trip, telling people, “I think small, but I think of doing big things for small people. Did India’s name ever reverberate in the US before? It did this time, not because of Modi but because of its 125 crore people.”
The audience, hanging on to Modi’s every word, didn’t have time for other speakers. Karnal MP Ashwini Kumar Chopra Minna had to leave his address mid-way after being booed. “I know you all have come to listen to Modiji, I can talk to you some other day,” he said.
Empty vessels make the most noise: Sonia Gandhi
Barely two hours after his Karnal speech, Sonia hit out at Modi at a rally in Meham, saying “empty vessels make the most noise”.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence,” she said.
"Has inflation come down? Is the poor man getting food at cheaper rate? Have the unemployed got jobs?" she asked.
Over the next 10 days Modi will be on a campaign blitzkrieg in the two poll-bound states, with over 10 rallies in Haryana and more than 20 in Maharashtra.
With no local face in these two states, the BJP is banking heavily on him for campaigning, especially since the party split with its allies, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Haryana Janhit Congress in Haryana.

Nikki Haley holds lead in South Carolina s G...Bobby Jindal
(Haley is the first woman…)
WASHINGTON: South Carolina's Indian-American Republican governor Nikki Haley is maintaining a 10 point lead over her Democratic challenger and state Senator Vincent Sheheen ahead of the governor's poll next month, according to a new poll.
The poll by Winthrop University shows Haley, born Nimrata 'Nikki' Randhawa, daughter of Sikh immigrant parents from Punjab, with a 43.6 per cent to 33.6 per cent margin, ABC News reported.
Attorney and former judge Tom Ervin is a distant third with 3.9 per cent of the votes while 23.4 per cent of the total 1,082 likely voters, who participated in the poll, are still undecided.
The elections are scheduled to take place on November 4. Haley is riding high on the strong performance of South Carolina's economy with more than half of the voters surveyed saying they are fairly pleased with the state's economy.
Haley is the first woman to serve as Governor of South Carolina and at the age of 42, she is the youngest current Governor in the US.
She is one of two sitting Indian-American Governors in the US , the other being Republican Bobby Jindal of Louisiana .
The voters also gave President Barack Obama a 28 per cent approval rating, which according to the poll lags behind Obama's national approval, and the Congress a still lower 12.7 per cent approval rating.

Timing of Chinese incursion with Xi visit a mystery: IAFchiefPrint
Raha said that a fighter aircraft base is coming up at Nyoma in Ladakh, but added that the project would take about five years to be completed.
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 6:14 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 3:44 pm
The Chinese incursion into Ladakh and the way the episode had coincided with the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India was a “mystery”, IAF chief Arup Raha said on Saturday even as he stressed that Indian forces were not yielding any ground at the border.
“It’s been always a mystery the way incursions take place and the way they get timed with various visits… It’s nothing new, it remains a mystery for all of us.
“You all know that in diplomacy a lot of signalling is done, especially so with our northern neighbour. It could be part of some signalling to my mind. But I am not going to guess what it really means,” he said at an interaction ahead of Indian Air Force’s 82nd anniversary celebrations on Oct. 8.
However, making it clear that India was “not giving ground to anyone”, Raha blamed the frequent face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control on differences of perception between the two countries over the actual position.
“There are differences in perception as to where is the LAC… This is leading to face-offs. However, our security forces are following policies… We are not giving ground to anyone,” he said.
Meanwhile, referring to the measures being taken to build military infrastructure along the border with China, Raha said that a fighter aircraft base is coming up at Nyoma in Ladakh, but added that the project would take about five years to be completed.
Another base would come up in Kargil, he said, adding that the funds will be released soon for it. “These bases are strategically important for us and will improve our capabilities,” he said. Upgrade of six airfields in the northeast is also being carried out and the work will be completed by the end of 2015. That would allow air force to operate fixed wing aircraft from there for swifter force mobilisation, Raha said.

Siemens may close some energy plants amid lo...Siemens may close some energy plants amid low margins
By Reuters | 4 Oct, 2014, 06.38PM IST
Siemens expects low profit margins at its energy division in the next couple of years and could close some factories as a result.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
FRANKFURT: German industrial conglomerate Siemens expects low profit margins at its energy division in the next couple of years and could close some factories as a result, the head of the division told the Boersen-Zeitung newspaper.
Lisa Davis said the company was reviewing individual sites and it was unclear whether some would be closed or whether they would be used for different products.
"We will see low margins (in the Power and Gas unit) in the next two to three years," she was quoted as saying.
The newly-created Siemens Power and Gas division makes products ranging from gas turbines and compressors to oilfield equipment. Siemens strengthened it this year with the acquisitions of US-based Dresser Rand as well as Rolls Royce's power unit.
The takeovers will help Siemens adjust to a change in energy markets, where small, decentralised units are on the rise to the detriment of large power plants, Davis told the paper.
"By 2030 about a third of our electricity will come from local systems," she was quoted as saying.
When announcing the Dresser Rand deal last month, Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said he expected demand for products such as gas turbines to rebound from 2016, adding the synergies from the deal justified the purchase price.
Siemens expects more than 150 million euros in annual synergies by 2019 from the Dresser Rand transaction, which complements its business in turbo compressors, downstream and industrial applications as well as larger steam turbines.
Davis indicated the group may not have to wait that long.
"We have calculated the synergies rather conservatively. It is well possible that we will see positive surprises," she told the paper.

Michael Reh , formerly EVP for business information and technology at SAP, will be based out of Hamburg, Germany , and reporting to one of the Executive Vice Presidents at Infosys, ET learns. Infosys currently has 12 EVPs although it is unclear for now what business will Reh be overseeing.
A spokeswoman for Infosys declined to comment.
To be sure, three other senior SAP executives, including Sanjay Rajagopalan, design and special projects head, are also on their way out from the eponymous German software firm though it is not certain for now if all of them will join Sikka at Infosys.
Earlier on 12 June when Infosys anointed Sikka as the first non-founder chief executive, the company also elevated twelve senior vice presidents to the rank of executive vice presidents. Eight of these report to Sikka directly while four of the EVPs report to chief operating officer UB Pravin Rao.
"It is quite natural for a new leader at a company to bring in a few of his former team members," said one of the executives at SAP. "It remains to be seen how many will Sikka like to bring in from SAP because he may not want to disturb the relationship between Infosys and SAP"
A spokesman for SAP said that the company is unperturbed on the four exits in the last two months and the company continues to remain a "strong attractor" for talent.
"We wish Dr. Sikka well," said a SAP spokesman. "People join and depart companies all the time and, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on individual personnel matters. This includes moves or anticipated moves or rumours. That said, SAP is a strong attractor of the world's best talent and we expect to end the year with more people than we started."

IFCI postpones NSE stake saleIFCI postpones NSE stake sale
Abhijit Lele & Sachin P Mampatta | Mumbai Oct 04, 2014 12:34 AM IST
IFCI, the Delhi-based government finance company, has postponed its plan to divest 2.5 per cent stake in the National Stock Exchange (NSE). According to two sources in the know of the matter, lower-than-expected bids from investors have forced the company to postpone its plan.  
IFCI had announced in June that it proposed to engage a consultant to “advise and manage” the partial divestment process. PowerhouseCoopers (PwC) is said to be handling the transaction. An email sent to a PwC spokesperson did not elicit a reply.
“With a view to unlock the value of its strategic investments, IFCI intends to disinvest its equity shareholding (direct) in the NSE to the extent of 112,500 equity shares (2.5 per cent out of its shareholding of 5.55 per cent),” according to a PwC note on the divestment reviewed by Business Standard.
PUSHING THE DEADLINE
IFCI announced plans to sell stake in NSE in June this year
Part of a larger plan to exit a number of non-core subsidiaries
Said to have been looking at three bids for the stake
However, valuations said to be lower than expectations
Plan for stake sale which was to conclude by September 30 has now been postponed
IDFC was reported to have sold a portion of its stake in the NSE in 2013. The sale is said to have been at a price of Rs 4,200 per share.
At the same price, it would have fetched IFCI about Rs 500 crore. The plan might be reviewed in a month’s time, said one of the sources. The IFCI stake sale was to be concluded by September 30.
IFCI has been working to unload a number of its non-strategic investments. On September 22, the company announced plans to partially sell its stake in the Tourism Finance Corporation of India Limited in the current financial year. It also previously announced plans to sell its entire stake in capital market subsidiary IFCI Financial Services Limited. It had been trying to integrate operations between IFCI Financial Service and Stock Holding Corporation of India (SHICL). It held 52.86 per cent in SHCIL after it completed the acquisition of stake in March this year from IDBI Bank for an undisclosed sum.
The largest stakeholder in the NSE is the Life Insurance Corporation of India (holds 10.51 per cent stake), followed by the State Bank of India (10.19 per cent), according to the NSE annual report.
IFCI held 5.55 per cent, while IDFC held 5.33 per cent in the country’s largest exchange. Other stakeholders include SHICL, GA Global Investments Limited, GS Strategic Investments Limited, SAIF II SE Investments Mauritius Limited and Aranda Investments (Mauritius) Pte. Ltd - all with five per cent each.
The NSE’s income rose from Rs 887.95 crore in the financial year ending in March 2013 to Rs 998.95 crore in March 2014. It had a net profit of Rs 937.97 crore compared to Rs 841.79 crore the previous year.
The exchange and IFCI did respond to the emails sent by Business Standard.

Rita Ganguly on Kaladharmi’s centennial celebration of Ghazal queen Begum Akhtar
“At last the penance of 40 years is over,” says eminent vocalist Rita Ganguly. It was 40 years ago, on October 30, 1974, that her guru, peerless singer and “mother of Ghazal” Begum Akhtar passed away. Ever since, her senior disciple has been keeping her memory alive with concerts, a book, a documentary film and other activities. “And now it’s the 100th year of her birth,” says Ganguly, who is preparing for the two-day centenary festival “Jamal-e-Begum Akhtar” that begins Monday. The festival is presented by Kaladharmi in association with Teamwork Arts.
“She was a founder member of Kaladharmi. She named it,” Ganguly says, reminding us of her guru’s inclusive thinking process that considered all artists has having but one religion — art. And it is only because she herself established Kaladharmi that her disciples and admirers continued to celebrate her contribution to music, she points out.
The run-up to the centenary began in 2007. For the past several years on the Begum’s birth anniversary, the Begum Akhtar Academy of Ghazal (BAAG) — an organisation founded by Ganguly to promote Urdu and the art of Ghazal — has been conferring awards to artists in senior and junior categories. This year, celebrated ghazal exponent Pankaj Udhas has been selected for BAAG’s Lifetime Achievement Award, while the BAAG Award goes to Amjad Islam Amjad, eminent poet of Pakistan.
In a unique highlight, Udhas and Ganguly will take the stage with Talat Aziz, Anup Jalota, Chandan Das and Penaz Masani to sing one of the Begum’s ghazals on the first day. The second evening features shayaari recitals by, besides Amjad Islam Amjad, Sheen Kaf Nizam and Rajesh Reddy (both BAAG Award recipients from earlier years). “They will be joined by two young people, Madan Mohan ‘Danish’ and Manzar Bhopali,” she says, explaining that the latter is a young poet expressly invited because “he gives you an example of how earlier the ghazal was sung by poets. It was sung as a musical form by Begum Akhtar. That’s why she is known as mother of Ghazal.”
Ganguly is happy that the government is taking note of the importance of this occasion in a number of ways. “This year a road in Kolkata is being named Begum Akhtar Sarani. In Lucknow, the street she lived on will be named Begum Akhtar Marg. An unnamed road in Faizabad, where she was born is going to be named after her. And the house she was born in is going to be turned into a museum. It is adjacent to a garden created by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. There you have the mausoleum of his wife,” she says, noting that this too should be a tourist attraction and if an annual festival were held there in honour of Begum Akhtar, the event would bring revenues and popularity.
What doesn’t please her so much is the response from the municipal authorities in the Capital to her request for naming a chowk after the Begum. “I got a reply saying ‘NDMC on principle doesn’t given any chowk in anybody’s name’.” Then how did Rajiv Chowk, Indira Gandhi Chowk and Ram Charan Agarwal Chowk (ITO) get their names, she wonders.
Meanwhile, she notes, the Ministry of Culture earmarked a budget of 2.5 crore rupees for Begum Akhtar’s centenary celebrations. But no part of the funds have reached Kaladharmi, she maintains, though she will as an individual artist be singing at an official event on October 7 morning, the birth date of the Begum, and has been part of other government arranged centennial events. Referring to the Ministry’s plans for the centennial, she says, “I feel they are wrongly diverting their attention towards other genres.” These include Qawwali, Thumri and Dadra. Though her guru sang Thumri and Dadra too, she admits, “There are others who sang them better. She should be celebrated for her contribution to Ghazal.”
She concludes with a significant comment. “It (Ghazal) is a secular medium. All the others are about Radha and Krishna.”
“Ai Mohabbat”
Rita Ganguly is teaming up with Anup Jalota to produce a feature film on the life and times of Begum Akhtar. The film is to be directed by Ketan Mehta, with music by A.R. Rahman and script and dialogues by Ganguly. So far Jackie Shroff and Irfaan have confirmed their participation. The lead actress is yet to be finalised.
“Jamal-E-Begum Akhtar”, October 6 and 7, Stein Auditorium, India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road, New Delhi, will also feature Rita Ganguly’s documentary film on her guru on both days. Entry through donor passes available on Book My Show or at the venue.

US health officials identify 10 people at  high risk  to Ebola virusPress Trust of India | Houston | Posted: October 4, 2014 9:34 am
US health officials were monitoring 50 people for Ebola exposure, 10 of whom are at “high risk” of the disease after coming in close contact with the first diagnosed American patient.
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified 10 people who had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, America’s first diagnosed case of Ebola.
CDC made contact with about 100 people that had possible contact with Duncan, and narrowed to 50 the list of people it needs to monitor daily.
The agency will continue to monitor all 50 of them for the full 21-day incubation period of the virus and see if they develop symptoms such as fever, aches, vomiting or diarrhoea.
The CDC said none of the people under observation are currently sick.
Late on Friday, four family members related to the Dallas Ebola patient were removed from their apartment, according to City of Dallas spokesperson Sana Syed.
Cleanup effort is still ongoing. The family members are asymptomatic. Daily monitoring includes a temperature reading twice a day.
The CDC has 10 disease control experts on the ground in Dallas in response to Duncan’s Ebola diagnosis, confirmed Tuesday.
Texas Commissioner of Health David Lakey would not release a specific numeric breakdown of the individuals, other than saying three of the 50 individuals are EMT workers.
Some of the individuals are those who didn’t have face to face contact with Duncan, but handled his blood for lab work at the hospital.
The others are people who had contact with Duncan in the community. The health care workers classified as “high risk” have been furloughed from work with pay.
The Ebola outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people, mostly in Africa, the World Health Organisation said Friday.

New Delhi: Former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and JD(U) President Sharad Yadav will campaign for INLD candidates in Haryana in the forthcoming Assembly elections due on October 15.
"Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar will hold public rallies in different parts of Haryana jointly organised by INLD and JD(U). We also welcome the support extended to INLD (Indian National Lok Dal) by Janata Dal (S) president H D Deve Gowda in the coming assembly elections," JD(U) spokesperson KC Tyagi said in a statement.
Party president Sharad Yadav has already announced his party's support to the Om Prakash Chautala-led INLD in the forthcoming elections.
The party has also called upon all the non-BJP regional outfits to extend their support to ensure the defeat of "divisive" forces in the elections.

The party has also called upon all the non-BJP regional outfits to extend their support to ensure the defeat of "divisive" forces in the elections.
"We call upon all the non-BJP regional outfits and its leaders to extend their support ensuring the defeat of divisive forces led by BJP as it will become the turning point of Indian politics for the unity and formation of bigger Janata Dal parivar," Tyagi said.
He said that the party president Sharad Yadav was making all-round efforts and was in touch with many regional outfits. Both INLD and JD(U) belong to the old Janata Parivar.
Tyagi said that the party also welcomed the support of Shiromani Akali Dal patron and Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal.
He said that the support has has proved to be a moral boosting exercise for INLD in different part of the state. Shiromani Akali Dal is an allay of BJP-led NDA at the Centre and the two parties are running a coalition government in Punjab.
He said that the upcoming elections in Haryana reminds the party of the elections of the state in 1987 when Chaudhary Devi Lal swept the polls and which became the rallying point and consolidation of Janata Dal in 1988.

Mumbai/New Delhi: A suspected explosive device onboard a stand-by Air India VVIP aircraft has turned out to be a plastic wrapper, an airline official said in New Delhi on Saturday.
After a thorough screening of the aircraft, the object "was found to be a plastic wrapper", the official said.
The Jeddah Airport security cleared the Boeing B-747 aircraft - AI 965 - for further operations later on Saturday morning.

The Indian security apparatus went into a tizzy early Saturday after the suspicious object, initially presumed to be an explosive, was found by the cabin crew on the Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah flight at its termination point.
"We have already formed a committee to look into the matter of how such an object, though harmless in nature, come on board. The aircraft was secured and cleared by the airport authorities in Jeddah," a senior Air India official said.
The committee includes the AI Joint Managing Director and the Commissioner of Civil Aviation Security.
"At no point of time was the safety of the passengers on the aircraft compromised," AI said in a statement.
The aircraft was on stand-by for use by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in case his regular aircraft developed any last minute snags during his US visit.
It was kept in complete readiness at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, and released Friday for commercial operations after Modi's return to India.

NCW chairperson Kumaramangalam slams singer Yesudas for his jeans remarkPrint
Press Trust of India | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: October 4, 2014 6:33 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 6:42 pm
Criticising legendary singer K J Yesudas for his remark against women wearing jeans, Chairperson of National Commission for Women, Lalitha Kumaramangalam, on Saturday said it was unfortunate that such an “unethical” comment was made by the top-notch singer.
“It is unfortunate that such a statement has been made by a man who has been so much in public life, whatever may be his personal view …There is nothing illegal in it but it was unethical,” Kumaramangalam said.
Speaking at a Gandhi Jayanthi function in Thiruvananthapuram, Yesudas had said, “women should not cause trouble to others by wearing jeans…. What should be covered must be covered.”
The legendary Malayali singer, who always appears in pristine white ‘dhothi’ and ‘kurta’ also said that attire like jeans was against Indian culture, which valued modesty as the greatest quality of women.
The comment by the 74-year-old playback singer and Carnatic vocalist sparked instant protests from women organisations of different political hues.

Slow modernisation of capabilities a big concern: IAF chief7
0
New Delhi: Air force chief Arup Raha on Saturday expressed concern over delays in its projects and said it was the government's responsibility to provide whatever was necessary as "Indian Air Force is India's air force not my air force".
Almost all key acquisition and development projects are running behind schedule, Raha said as he sounded a note of caution over its implication for IAF's fighting capability. But the air chief at the same time expressed hope that, under the new government at the Centre, steps would be taken to rectify the situation.
"We have quite a few fleets which are on their last legs. The draw down has to be prevented by quick induction of Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) as well as Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)," the air chief said at an interaction with the media ahead of IAF's 82nd anniversary.
It was the government's responsibility to provide whatever was necessary as "Indian Air Force is India's air force not my air force," said Raha.
#indian air force #arup raha
"Every project, be it acquisition or design development, is taking longer than it ideally should. We have lost time lines. Time overrun is much more than it should have been. It is a concern.
"After all Indian Air Force is India's air force, not my air force. It is the government's responsibility, the responsibility of the nation to provide whatever is necessary.
We are concerned that it is not coming on time," he said. However, hailing the new government, which he said "meant business", Raha expressed hope that under it all the processes would be reviewed so that a much faster system of greater accountability can be put in place.
"They are reviewing every project. Accountability is being fixed. There is a great urgency," he said, adding that all three service chiefs can meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi one -on-one every month to discuss matters of importance.
Talking about the projects that are caught up in delays, he cited the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA), which India is developing along with Russia and also said that there was an urgent need to replace the vintage light helicopters of the Army as well as air force as their flight safety record is not good.

BJP blames administrative lapses for stampedeThe arrangements for 'Ravana Vadh' ceremony at Gandhi Maidan were very slack in comparison to the huge crowd that attends it, said Yadav.
Press Trust of India | Patna | Posted: October 4, 2014 6:41 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 6:47 pm
BJP on Saturday blamed administrative “lapse” of the Bihar government for the stampede near the historic Gandhi Maidan here on Dusshera festival which claimed 33 lives and left 29 persons injured.
Blaming the administration for the incident, Leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly Nand Kishore Yadav said, “The loss of 33 lives is due to the failure of administration. The arrangements for ‘Ravana Vadh’ ceremony at Gandhi Maidan were very slack in comparison to the huge crowd that attends it.”
Yadav said the state government has ordered probe in the incident just to ‘save its face’ and should take action against all officials who were involved in making arrangements for the event.
“The way Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan showed their concern, was not seen in the state ministers. Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi took five hours to reach the hospital to see the injured.”
The state government, he said, did not learn any lesson from the 2012 stampede during Chhath festival when 21 persons were crushed to death.
Criticising the JD(U) government, Bihar BJP president Mangal Pandey said it seemed as if “a dead government was working in the state.”
“I attended the function and saw how poor the administrative arrangements were. A majority of the crowd attending the Ravana Vadh ceremony exits from the western gate of Gandhi Maidan. Had the police been present there in goodstrength, the tragedy could have been averted,” he added. BJP leaders held a candlelight meeting to pay homage to the deceased at Ram Gulam Chowk, the place where the incident occured.
A daylong dharna would be held by the party here on October 6 to highlight the lapses of the adminsitration and protest against the alleged poor arrangements in and around Gandhi Maidan during the ‘Ravan Vadh’ ceremony leading to the loss of lives, the party sources said.

As J&K grappled with floods  infiltration was on risePrint
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: October 4, 2014 6:36 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 6:47 pm
At a time when Army troops were rescuing people marooned in floods, terrorists across the Line of Control (LoC) took up desperate infiltration attempts.
Giving this information, Udhampur based Defence Ministry spokesperson, Colonel S D Goswami informed that though terrorist activities in September were overshadowed by floods in the valley, specially Srinagar, the month also witnessed a number of infiltration attempts by them which were foiled by vigilant Army troops, resulting into the elimination of 14 terrorists and apprehension of six others.
Giving details, he said that last month when incessant rains across Valley had caused large scale flooding in parts of South Kashmir, three terrorists were eliminated by Army troops during an encounter at Hanjan Bala near Shopian on September 02. Within a week thereafter, while Srinagar was inundated under flood waters, four more terrorists were killed by Army troops at Laribal near Rajwar and Pharkian on September 09 and 10, he pointed out.
“While situation was stabilizing in Srinagar and other flood affected parts of Valley, two terrorists were eliminated at Macchal on September 17, quickly followed by the killing of four more terrorists at Tangdhar on September 19,” Colonel Goswami said.
With the elimination of one more at Lolab on September 30, the total number of terrorists killed during September rise to 14, he said, adding that these numbers were apart from half a dozen others apprehended by troops with the help of Special Operation Group (SOG) and State Police from different parts of the Valley during the month. The Army has appreciate both the SOG and state police for assisting them in elimination and apprehension of terrorists during last month, he added.

Timing of Chinese incursion with Xi visit a mystery: IAF chiefPrint
Raha said that a fighter aircraft base is coming up at Nyoma in Ladakh, but added that the project would take about five years to be completed.
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 6:14 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 3:44 pm
The Chinese incursion into Ladakh and the way the episode had coincided with the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India was a “mystery”, IAF chief Arup Raha said on Saturday even as he stressed that Indian forces were not yielding any ground at the border.
“It’s been always a mystery the way incursions take place and the way they get timed with various visits… It’s nothing new, it remains a mystery for all of us.
“You all know that in diplomacy a lot of signalling is done, especially so with our northern neighbour. It could be part of some signalling to my mind. But I am not going to guess what it really means,” he said at an interaction ahead of Indian Air Force’s 82nd anniversary celebrations on Oct. 8.
However, making it clear that India was “not giving ground to anyone”, Raha blamed the frequent face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control on differences of perception between the two countries over the actual position.
“There are differences in perception as to where is the LAC… This is leading to face-offs. However, our security forces are following policies… We are not giving ground to anyone,” he said.
Meanwhile, referring to the measures being taken to build military infrastructure along the border with China, Raha said that a fighter aircraft base is coming up at Nyoma in Ladakh, but added that the project would take about five years to be completed.
Another base would come up in Kargil, he said, adding that the funds will be released soon for it. “These bases are strategically important for us and will improve our capabilities,” he said. Upgrade of six airfields in the northeast is also being carried out and the work will be completed by the end of 2015. That would allow air force to operate fixed wing aircraft from there for swifter force mobilisation, Raha said.

A roadside garden has shrunk the narrow Thayar Sahib Street further, say residents
One can understand the logic behind having a bit of greenery on an arterial road. But can one make sense of a garden on a narrow street with heavy vehicular traffic?
Residents of Thayar Sahib Street off Ellis Road have called into question the logic behind raising a roadside garden, approximately 50 metres long, next to the compound wall of the Government Muslim High School on Thayar Sahib Street.
“What purpose does this park serve? It is used as a grazing ground by cattle and a urinating point by pedestrians,” says Syed Asad, a long-time resident of the street.
Next to the garden is a huge dustbin where waste from various streets is dumped. The dustbin eats up road space. Further reducing the width of the roads are cars and lorries parked on the street.
Thayar Sahib Street, located off Ellis Road and G.P. Road, is used by motorists to get to Anna Salai from Triplicane. The presence of a hospital, a few clinics and a high school brings in many people and adds to the traffic chaos. Hardware shops and mechanic sheds are also among factors making the stretch busy.
“A pavement would have been helpful as many schoolchildren walk on this road,” says Asad, a freelance photographer.
Many residents are of the opinion that neighbourhoods such as Triplicane and Royapettah with narrow streets are not the place to have an elevated garden.
Residents have represented to various departments to clear the encroachments on the roads. They also want the stretch to be made an one-way.
“The roadside garden was built after we received complaints that people were littering the stretch outside the school and misusing it as a public toilet. The stretch is better now. With regard to encroachments, police should take action,” said a Corporation official of the Zone.

Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and  Ram Vilas Paswan demanded the resignation of chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, saying the tragedy happened because the administration had no system in place.
Describing the tragedy as "regrettable and shameful", Ravi Shankar Prasad said the state government miserably failed to learn from past incidents.

"There was a stampede during Chhath puja in 2012 and bomb explosions during Narendra Modi's rally in October last year. Still no proper arrangements were made," he said.
Prasad said the Centre would extend all help to the state government to deal with the situation. "I have already spoken to home minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Harsh Vardhan. A team of NDRF has already left for Patna to assist the state administration," he added.
Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, hitting out at the JD(U) government said: "There was no security, no lighting, one gate was open while more than five lakh people were present there and the police were there only to rain lathis on the hapless people."
"This is not the first time it has happened. The state government is insensitive and solely responsible for this.  It took hours for them to react. I will submit a report to Union home minister and the prime minister once I return," he said.

Even RJD leader Lalu Prasad who supports the Manjhi government said it was an "administrative lapse" and that there were no foolproof crowd control measures despite past incidents.
"The Gandhi Maidan stampede appears to be a matter of administrative lapse ( sic).  Stern action should be taken against officials found guilty. I am keeping a watch over the event," Prasad tweeted.
Prasad said the RJD had been demanding the boundary wall of the Gandhi Maidan should be lowered and that there should be more entry and exit points to the grounds.
The Bihar government  meanwhile constituted a two man committee consisting of  principal home secretary Amir Shubhani and additional director general, headquarters Gupteshwar Pandey to probe the reasons for the stampede.
The investigation report will be submitted to the government and the ministry of home affairs within 24 hours, officials said.

Patna MP Shatrughan Sinha criticised the district administration for improper preparations and demanded an impartial probe  to bring the guilty to book.
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Tariq Anwar too demanded strict action against the officials responsible for the stampede.
JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav assured strict action against those responsible. "The incident will be probed and those found guilty of laxity and carelessness will face strong action," he said.
Thirty three people were killed, all of them due to suffocation, and 29 others injured in the stampede that happened towards the end of the Dussehra day celebrations on Friday evening.
Of the dead, 21 were women, 10 were minors and two men, according to the list available at the Patna Medical College Hospital.

Hong Kong govt denies using triad gangs to break up protestsHK govt denies using triad gangs against protesters

Hong Kong's security chief furiously denied the government had used triad gangs against pro-democracy protesters on Saturday after accusations hired thugs had been brought in to stir up violent clashes. 
Two of the city's busiest shopping districts descended into chaos on Friday as groups targeted protesters who have brought parts of Hong Kong to a standstill for the past week.
The protesters are demanding the right to nominate who can run as their next leader in 2017 elections, while Beijing has said only candidates it has approved will be able to stand.
China has accused democracy campaigners of destabilising the city and on Saturday said they were "daydreaming" over the prospect of change.
"The actions taken by Hong Kong police to handle Occupy Central are an inescapable necessity to preserve the rule of law," an editorial in Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily said.
Out of 19 people arrested during Friday's clashes, police said eight were suspected triads and Amnesty International blasted officers who "stood by and did nothing" to protect protesters.
"I have noticed that people have said the government has turned a blind eye towards the triads or even was cooperating with triads," an angry Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok told reporters, raising his voice.
"These accusations are made up and are very excessive," he said.
But democrat lawmaker Albert Ho said the police "seemed to show a lot of indulgence to triad activities".
"I have every reason to believe that must be the only option left to those in power in Hong Kong to see that the protesters are cleared from the public area," he told AFP.
"The only way is to allow someone else to do it, short of doing it themselves," Ho said.
Fellow democrat James To also pointed the finger at the authorities.
"I cannot believe that the experienced Mong Kok police could not identify triad gangsters," he was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post.
"The government has used organised, orchestrated forces and even triad gangs in an attempt to disperse citizens."
Triad gangs have traditionally been involved in drug-running, prostitution and extortion but are increasingly involved in legitimate ventures such as property and the finance industry.
Some are believed to also have links with the political establishment and there have previously been allegations of triads sending paid thugs to stir up trouble during protests.
Assaults and intimidation
Fears of intimidation have replaced a previous sense of unity after Friday's ugly backlash, with reports of sexual assaults and attacks on journalists.
The violence prompted student protest leaders to scrap talks with the government, scuppering hopes of a resolution to the crisis.
Demonstrators compared the police "inaction" during the clashes to scenes last Sunday, when officers fired tear gas at peaceful crowds.
At a press briefing Saturday, police denied acting in concert with triads, adding that 12 people had been injured in the clashes, including six officers.
"Police in the small hours in different locations arrested 19 males," senior superintendent Patrick Kwok told media.
"Within the people who were arrested, eight were arrested for illegal assembly. We believe these have triad backgrounds," Kwok said.
There were widespread allegations of sexual assault in the packed crowds, with three girls seen being bundled into a police van in tears after apparently being assaulted at the Causeway Bay protest.
Journalists have also been targeted and the Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club voiced its concern Saturday over attacks on reporters.
"The Foreign Correspondents' Club... is deeply disturbed by these reports, especially those ascribed directly to police officers, or where police could have intervened but do not appear to have done so," it said in a statement.
But officials have blamed both sides for the escalation.
"I urgently want to express to all citizens, no matter what attitude you have towards Occupy (Central), you still have to remain calm, and not use violence or disrupt order under any situation," Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who is viewed by demonstrators as a Beijing stooge, said in a televised message.
Protest sites were tense with fears of further attacks by opposition groups.
Friday's clashes broke out as the city returned to work after a two-day public holiday with store owners and delivery drivers frustrated after a week of disruption to business.

Commercial bank credit growth remains weak at 9.7%Commercial bank credit growth remains sluggish at 9.7 per cent

Credit growth of commercial banks continued to remain weak with a growth of just 9.7 per cent at Rs 61,46,526 crore for the fortnight to September 19, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data.
Bank credit was Rs 56,02,021 crore in the corresponding period last year.
This was for the second consecutive fortnight that the credit growth came at sub-10 per cent.
Bankers have expressed concerns over sluggish credit demand and appear reluctant to cut lending rates.
Recently, HDFC Bank Managing Director and CEO Aditya Puri said both the lending and deposit rates are a function of credit demand and "currently it is not exceedingly healthy".
Deposits grew 13.33 per cent to Rs 81,06,633 crore in the fortnight to September 19 as compared with Rs 71,50,374 crore in the year-ago period.
Demand deposit expanded 12.40 per cent to Rs 7,36,751 crore as of September 19 from Rs 6,55,428 crore in the same period a year ago.
Time deposit rose 13.47 per cent to Rs 73,69,898 crore as against Rs 64,94,947 crore in the same period last year.

Poor-rich gap growing in India  Asia-Pacific: UN reportPoor-rich gap growing in India, Asia-Pacific: UN report
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 4, 2014  | 12:44 IST
The gap between the poor and the rich is growing in the Asia-Pacific region and there has been an increase in income inequality in many major economies including India, China and Indonesia, a United Nations - Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific report has said.
"Inequality is...key socio-economic challenge for the region. At the national level, there has been an increase in income inequality in many major economies in recent decades," the report by UN-ESCAP said.
"Widening income gaps across societies and within communities are the consequence of a series of factors."
The Gini coefficient - a measure of income inequality - between early 1990s and late 2000s increased from 30.8 to 33.9 in India; 32.4 to 42.1 in China and in Indonesia it increased from 29.2 to 38.1, the report said.
However, during the same period the coefficient decreased in countries such as Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand and Uzbekistan.
Weaker labour market institutions, inadequate social protection systems, poor-quality education, inadequate access to credit and land and excessive asset concentration are among the factors for widening income gaps, the report said.
"The gap between rich and poor is widespread in the region and continuing to grow in many countries...the poorest 20 per cent of the population accounts for less than 10 per cent of national income," it said.
UN-ESCAP conducted the study for about 40 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
The ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) in the regions shows that persons with a net worth of $30 million or more accounted for 30 per cent of the region's income in 2012-13, the report said.
"This shows that wealth concentration is a major characteristic of income inequality. The region had around 49,000 persons (0.001 per cent of Asia-Pacific population in 2013) classed as UHNWIs, with about $7.5 trillion of net wealth in 2012-13," it added.
The wide gap in national income held by the ultra-rich and the poor is striking, the report said.
"It has been observed that the wealth-income ratio is rising due to the growing share of capital in national income, which is further exacerbating the inequality gap between the top 1 per cent of the population and the poorest 20 per cent."
In addition to vertical inequality among individuals, there have also been widening horizontal disparities, especially between rural and urban areas, as well as between coastal regions and the interior.
"This is particularly worrying for large multiracial countries with significant regional variations, since it can trigger social and political instability," the report added.

Now  a platform to help people organise hackathonsNow, a platform to help people organise hackathons

Hyderabad, Oct. 4:  
With the number of app developers growing and more and more institutes organising hackathons, a group of like-minded techies have joined hands to start a hackathon platform that makes it easy for people to conduct hackathons. The platform will have an online presence at hyderabadhackers.in.
The number of hackathons has gone up significantly in the city. The success of August Fest, the maiden hackathon held at the national level, reflects the mood. The app developers, small and big, are taking up the challenges to build apps relevant for users of different mobile operating systems.
“The Metropolis is the latest example. We are organising two parallel hackathons – one with the help of the Telangana Government and the Hyderabad municipal authorities – to develop apps to improve quality of life in urban areas,” Hyderabad Software Exporters’ Association President Ramesh Loganathan told Business Line.
“Seeing interest in the app developers, the number of hackathons is growing up. But hosting a hackathon is not something very easy. The platform would save them from the hassle,” he said.
HYSEA, Startup Weekends, Angel Hack, Devthons, Uptech Idea Labs, Null Hyderabad, Hyderabad Entrepreneurship Society, Purple Talk and Telangana Academy of Skill and Knowledge (TASK) will jointly host the online platform.
The other hackathon is focussed on Internet of Things (IoT), where the organisers are providing with kits to developers to develop apps to build solutions for urban problems using sensors that are connected to the Internet. About 22 teams participated on Saturday for the Smart cities’ Devthon being held at the Engineering Staff College of India (ESCI).
“Besides offering the solutions, we would like to organise about 50 hacking and proto-typing events in the next 7-8 months,” Ramesh, who is also the Managing Director of Progress Software India, said.
Ramesh, who is actively associated with the start-up ecosystem in the city, has said that like-minded people have joined together to build the platform that makes it easy for people to organise hackathons. “The online platform will help the organisers send invites, fliers and alerts to the participants. It will also handhold them in various steps,” he said.

Timing of Chinese incursion with Xi visit a...Arup Raha
(The Chinese incursion into…)
NEW DELHI: The Chinese incursion into Ladakh and the way the episode had coincided with the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India was a "mystery", IAF chief Arup Raha said today even as he stressed that Indian forces were not yielding any ground at the border.
"It's been always a mystery the way incursions take place and the way they get timed with various visits... It's nothing new, it remains a mystery for all of us.
"You all know that in diplomacy a lot of signalling is done, especially so with our northern neighbour. It could be part of some signalling to my mind. But I am not going to guess what it really means," he told reporters at an interaction ahead of Indian Air Force's 82nd anniversary celebrations on Oct. 8.
However, making it clear that India was "not giving ground to anyone", Raha blamed the frequent face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control on differences of perception between the two countries over the actual position.
"There are differences in perception as to where is the LAC ... This is leading to face-offs. However, our security forces are following policies... We are not giving ground to anyone," he said.
Meanwhile, referring to the measures being taken to build military infrastructure along the border with China, Raha said that a fighter aircraft base is coming up at Nyoma in Ladakh, but added that the project would take about five years to be completed.
Another base would come up in Kargil, he said, adding that the funds will be released soon for it.
"These bases are strategically important for us and will improve our capabilities," he said.
Upgrade of six airfields in the northeast is also being carried out and the work will be completed by the end of 2015.
That would allow air force to operate fixed wing aircraft from there for swifter force mobilisation, Raha said.

BJP blames administrative lapses forstampedeThe arrangements for 'Ravana Vadh' ceremony at Gandhi Maidan were very slack in comparison to the huge crowd that attends it, said Yadav.
Press Trust of India | Patna | Posted: October 4, 2014 6:41 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 6:47 pm
BJP on Saturday blamed administrative “lapse” of the Bihar government for the stampede near the historic Gandhi Maidan here on Dusshera festival which claimed 33 lives and left 29 persons injured.
Blaming the administration for the incident, Leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly Nand Kishore Yadav said, “The loss of 33 lives is due to the failure of administration. The arrangements for ‘Ravana Vadh’ ceremony at Gandhi Maidan were very slack in comparison to the huge crowd that attends it.”
Yadav said the state government has ordered probe in the incident just to ‘save its face’ and should take action against all officials who were involved in making arrangements for the event.
“The way Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan showed their concern, was not seen in the state ministers. Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi took five hours to reach the hospital to see the injured.”
The state government, he said, did not learn any lesson from the 2012 stampede during Chhath festival when 21 persons were crushed to death.
Criticising the JD(U) government, Bihar BJP president Mangal Pandey said it seemed as if “a dead government was working in the state.”
“I attended the function and saw how poor the administrative arrangements were. A majority of the crowd attending the Ravana Vadh ceremony exits from the western gate of Gandhi Maidan. Had the police been present there in goodstrength, the tragedy could have been averted,” he added. BJP leaders held a candlelight meeting to pay homage to the deceased at Ram Gulam Chowk, the place where the incident occured.
A daylong dharna would be held by the party here on October 6 to highlight the lapses of the adminsitration and protest against the alleged poor arrangements in and around Gandhi Maidan during the ‘Ravan Vadh’ ceremony leading to the loss of lives, the party sources said.

Giving details, he said that last month when incessant rains across Valley had caused large scale flooding in parts of South Kashmir, three terrorists were eliminated by Army troops during an encounter at Hanjan Bala near Shopian on September 02. Within a week thereafter, while Srinagar was inundated under flood waters, four more terrorists were killed by Army troops at Laribal near Rajwar and Pharkian on September 09 and 10, he pointed out.
“While situation was stabilizing in Srinagar and other flood affected parts of Valley, two terrorists were eliminated at Macchal on September 17, quickly followed by the killing of four more terrorists at Tangdhar on September 19,” Colonel Goswami said.
With the elimination of one more at Lolab on September 30, the total number of terrorists killed during September rise to 14, he said, adding that these numbers were apart from half a dozen others apprehended by troops with the help of Special Operation Group (SOG) and State Police from different parts of the Valley during the month. The Army has appreciate both the SOG and state police for assisting them in elimination and apprehension of terrorists during last month, he added.

New intervention can decrease mean girl behavioursNew intervention can decrease ‘mean girl’ behaviours
PTI
Washington, Oct 2:  
Scientists have developed and tested an intervention which they claim can decrease ‘mean girl’ bullying among teens.
Relational aggression, or ‘mean girl’ bullying, is a nonphysical form of aggression generally used among adolescent girls which includes gossipping, rumour spreading, exclusion and rejection.
University of Missouri researchers have now developed and tested an intervention that effectively decreases relational aggression among teen girls.
“Good outcomes can happen when priorities are set by schools and families to prevent and eliminate relational aggression,” said co-author Connie Brooks, an assistant professor in the Department of Health Psychology in the School of Health Professions and in the Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders.
“This study was an attempt to address this social problem in a meaningful way by testing an intervention to reduce relational aggression among teen girls,” Brooks said.
The intervention, Growing Interpersonal Relationships through Learning and Systemic Supports (GIRLSS), developed by MU researchers, is a 10-week, group counselling, caregiver training and caregiver phone consultation intervention for relationally aggressive middle school girls and their families.
Students, ranging in age from 12 to 15, participated in one 70-minute session per week that included interactive discussions, media-based examples, role-playing, journaling and weekly goal setting.
At the end of the intervention, school counsellors and teachers reported a decrease in relationally aggressive behaviours among the girls.
Caregivers of students participated in separate workshops and biweekly phone consultations during which they learned new communication, monitoring and supervision strategies in addition to appropriate disciplinary responses.
According to Brooks, relational aggression is a complicated issue with many variables, including schools, families and individuals.
She said parents and teachers should be aware of relational aggression so they don’t unknowingly contribute to the negative behaviours.
The research was published in the Journal of Child and Family Studies.

What stopped stocks  freefall this weekStocks stabilize as five shock absorbers kick in

The stock market stabilizes. (Sal Ruibal, USA TODAY)
Just when it looked like the U.S. stock market was going to crack amid the pressure of a new array of risks, it found its footing and stabilized thanks to a handful of factors that acted like shock absorbers for the market.
Just three days ago, on the first day of October, a month that spooks investors because of stock market crashes in October 1929 and 1987, stocks were in free fall. Wall Street was buzzing about how far stocks could fall — and whether the benchmark S&P 500-stock index was finally on a collision course with its first 10% drop, or correction, since late 2011.
The world — and the stock market — appeared in chaos and disarray as a confluence of scary headlines rattled the nerves of even the most ardent Wall Street bulls, prompting a 238-point plunge Wednesday in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong seemed on the verge of spinning out of control. The U.S. announced its first-ever diagnosis of Ebola on home soil. The small-cap Russell 2000 stock index — a bull market leader the past five years — fell 10% below its early March all-time high and into official “correction” territory. And weak manufacturing readings in Germany and the rest of the eurozone sparked fears of a global growth slowdown.
Fast-forward to today and the stock market appears far more stable, with stocks turning sharply higher amid fresh signs that the U.S. labor market — and the broader economy — may be in solid shape after all.
In early trading Friday, the Dow was up more than 140 points to 16,941, after climbing as much as 150 points earlier in the session. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.9% to 1964 and the Nasdaq was up 1.2% to 4483.
What caused the tone of the market to flip from bearish to bullish virtually overnight? Here are five factors that have acted as shock absorbers for the fragile market at a pivotal time.
1. Blowout jobs report. Any concerns that the U.S. job-creation machine was stalling out went by the wayside Friday when the government released its September jobs report.
The U.S. economy created 248,000 jobs last month, topping forecasts of 215,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The unemployment rate declined to 5.9% — the lowest level since July 2008 — and better than the 6.1% forecast.
The government also revised up the weak August jobs report to 180,000 jobs from 142,000, and July job gains to 243,000 from 212,000. However, worker pay didn’t budge, as average hourly wage gains were unchanged. That signals that wage inflation remains tame, which is a bullish sign for stocks as it gives the Federal Reserve some ammunition to argue that speeding up the timetable for interest rate hikes might not be necessary, despite the strong reading on the labor market.
The upbeat jobs report also shows that the economy is not falling off a cliff and is still strong enough to support solid corporate earnings growth despite slowdowns in Europe and China.
“This morning there is a sigh of relief on both Wall Street and Main Street,” says Sung Won Sohn, a finance professor at California State University CI. “The jobs slowdown in August was an aberration and the economy is back on a healthier growth trajectory.”
2. Hong Kong protests don’t cause meltdown. The pro-democracy protests have not spiraled out of control, despite the ongoing standoff between the China-backed Hong Kong government and protesters. In fact, the size of the street protests appeared to be dwindling Friday after the Hong Kong government agreed to talks with the protesters. What’s more, the key Hang Seng stock index rose 0.6% to 23,064.56 Friday after steep selloffs earlier in the week and after markets were closed for two days for holidays tied to China’s independence 65 years ago.
Investors viewed both developments in Asia as a sign that the protests might not spiral out of control as feared and morph into an economic crisis.
3. Small-cap stocks rebound. Market pessimism peaked Wednesday when the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index closed down more than 10% from its March 4 record high of 1208.65, putting it into official correction territory. However, the small-cap index mounted a 1% rebound Thursday and is up another 1% today.
The rebound in what is considered a proxy for risk-taking on Wall Street suggests that the buy-the-dip mentality on Wall Street is not dead. It also downplayed fears that the small-cap selloff was going to drag down the broader market.
4. Ebola, a scare, but not a crisis. The first diagnosed case of the deadly Ebola virus in the U.S. has dragged down shares of airlines and other travel-related stocks, but Wall Street is still not treating the scare as a major economic crisis — at least not yet. Markets typically don’t sell off sharply unless there is a clear sign that a health-related epidemic has real, lasting negative economic impact.
5. Seasonally strong time of year. The stock market is heading into its strongest seasonal three-month and six-month periods of the year, so investors are giving the market the benefit of the doubt for now. The bulls on Wall Street still argue that the economy and labor market are strong, which should translate into solid performance for corporate profitability, a key underpinning of the stock market rally the past five years.

Modi govt has formed a base; growth may hit 7-8% next yr: SBIArundhati Bhattacharya
("India has been brought…)
In a chat with ET Now, Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairman, SBI, talks about their new initiative SBI InTouch and also shares her business and macroeconomic outlook. Excerpts:
ET Now: Tell us about SBI InTouch. What this new and swanky branch is all about and are you looking at opening more such branches? Will there be more tie-ups with various IT companies?
Arundhati Bhattacharya: We felt that it is necessary to create a sub-brand within SBI for the youth because we found that the youth perceive the State Bank of India to be very trustworthy, but it is perceived as your parent's banker, not really their banker.
With that in mind, we looked around to see what is it that the youth relate to and they relate very well to the digital experience. That being the case, we thought that we should go in for digital branches. The difference is these branches are located in malls, high street shopping areas, and sometimes in the SEZs where you have a large number of young customers. These branches do not have the standard chairs and tables, they do not have cash and basically, they give you what is called the immersive digital experience.
There are machines that will allow you to open your accounts. If you have an Aadhaar number and the scanning of your fingerprint, you will be able to get an account opened. You will be able to get a personalised debit card also from the card machine that is right next to the ATM kiosk. Other than that, there will be screens which will enable you to look for what you want. If you want a car loan, you can actually find out what are the models within the amount that you want. It will also give you the social networking feed which will tell you what people are saying about these models, what are the manufacturers claiming that these models are like. It will enable you at the same time to plan your loans.
If you give them the income criteria, they will tell you how much of loans are available. Similar to this, over a period of time, we will have the entire home loans being done out of this. Also things like vacation packages, education loans will all be covered here. We also have some little cubicles which we call remote pods. These will be available with remote experts and if you call them up, they will guide you and handhold you through any kind of loans you want to take.
ET Now: Having this virtual branch per se and also all the other automated transactions that the banks are now adopting, it will actually help you ease the pressure of manpower crunch that you will be facing because it says that in another four years, you could see nearly 40000 people retiring. So do you think that it will help bring down the cost as well as also help solve that particular problem to some extent?
Arundhati Bhattacharya: Definitely to some extent because while we have 40000 people retiring and we may take in 40000 also, but on the other side, you also have to understand that our demography is such that I will be getting many more customers. So it is not so much a question of people retiring, but it is also a question of our number of customers getting ramped up. This entire InTouch experience will shortly be also available on the mobile. So, people will be able to do everything that you are seeing over here in the comfort of their homes and if that is the case, obviously the requirements for people can come down.
  ET Now: Would you be interested in having a large telecommunication company being as a BC model for SBI? You have the customer base and definitely, it will make a good concept. Do you think that you will be interested in that?
Arundhati Bhattacharya: Definitely, we have to have some kinds of tie-ups. We are already doing a number of tie-ups for the BCs. For the corporate business correspondence, we have already tied up with a number of big corporates and, therefore, these mobile companies coming onboard are absolutely on the cards.
However, we still want to see the final guidelines regarding the payment banks. Over here, the regulator's requirement is that remittances and payments should become as simple as it can be made and the cash intensity has to come down. So everywhere, you need not have to take out cash in order to make small value payments. Now how do we get that right, how do we ensure that by the click of a button, you are able to send off money? It should be as simple as choosing your number from the contact list of your mobile.
When we are able to achieve that, there will be a proliferation of payments and for that we may not really need a payment bank. It may also be possible to do all of this without a payment banking structure merely by ensuring the link up of the mobile companies with the banks. So that is something that we are definitely looking at. We are trying to see how best this can be organised.
ET Now: There are reports that you are in talks with Airtel for BC model on payments bank. Are there some large telecom companies involved?

Man kills gay partner after latter attacks his mother for opposing their relationshipPress Trust of India | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 4, 2014 7:20 pm
An 18-year-old youth shot dead his homosexual partner here on Saturday after the latter attacked his mother for opposing their relationship, police said.
“The youth shot his homosexual partner killing him on the spot when he tried to kill the accused’s mother following an argument,” inspector P D Parmar said.
The incident took place at Chauhan’s house in Chunvalnagar slum in Bapu Nagar area.
According to police, the deceased went to Mehul’s house on Saturday and had an argument with his partner’s mother about why she objected to their same-sex relationship. During the argument he pulled out a country-made revolver and shot her.
“When the accused saw this, he snatched the revolver from his hand and fired three rounds at him, killing him on the spot,” the inspector said.
The duo had been in a relationship for a year.
The accused’s mother was injured seriously and was undergoing treatment at a government hospital, Parmar said adding, the youth has been arrested. Police is further investigating the issue.

Enthusiasm created by Swachh Bharat should be kept going: Narendra ModiPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 4, 2014 6:59 pm
Two days after launching the ‘Swachh Bharat’ campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the momentum of “enthusiasm” generated by the driveshould be kept going for the success of the mission.
He also expressed happiness over former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda joining the ambitious campaign. “I am very happy to see the enthusiasm for Swachh Bharat Mission. We must keep this momentum going for the success of the Mission,” Modi said a tweet.
“Am glad that former PM Shri HD Deve Gowda ji joined Swachh Bharat Mission. A very strong gesture,” he added in another tweet. Soon after Modi’s call for ‘Swachh Bharat’ campaign on Thursday, Deve Gowda took a broom and swept the Hassan railway station in in Karnataka.
Modi himself wielded the broom on October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, as he launched the ‘Clean India’ campaign, joined by chief ministers, lawmakers, prominent personalities from various fields along with lakhs of countrymen in a drive that is expected to cost nearly Rs 2 lakh crore.
Asserting that “Swachh Bharat” mission is “beyond politics” and inspired by “patriotism”, he had invoked Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of a “clean and developed” India as he formally kicked off the five-year-long campaign, which will cover 4,041 statutory towns, on the 145th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation.

Modi hits campaign trail in Maharashtra  Haryana; launches sharp attack on CongComments
Five months after a highly successful Lok Sabha election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is back to doing what he does best — working the crowds, wooing them with his one-liners and boundless energy. His request: absolute majority for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana.

Kicking off his campaign for the October 15 assembly polls on Saturday, Modi slipped easily into his role of champion vote-seeker at his first rally of the day — in the northern state’s Karnal district. Accusing the ruling Congress and opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) of neglecting farmers and promoting goondaism, he appealed to voters to give the BJP a chance.
Alleging irregularities in land allotment, he asked, “Who among the poor has got a plot? ...But where have thousands of acres of land disappeared, who has taken this? Does Haryana want to settle the account?”
In a veiled attack on the INLD, he asked the people if they would like to be governed from jail. INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, serving a jail sentence in a corruption case but currently out on bail, had said he’d take oath as CM from Tihar.

Promising development and jobs, he hinted that Karnal may be part of his 100 smart cities project. And carrying forward his Swachh Bharat mission, he said, “We may be living in the age of Hi-Fi and Wi-Fi but safai (cleanliness) is equally important.”
Ending the day in Mumbai, he told a crowd at the Mahalaxmi Race Course, “Mumbai and Maharashtra’s growth is important for the country’s growth. I can’t leave Mumbai helpless any longer. The city is the birthplace of the BJP, which has achieved so much in such a short time.”
Attacking the ruling Congress and its ally, the NCP, but choosing to ignore former ally Shiv Sena, Modi said, “Amitabh Bachchan hosts a TV show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, but these Congress and NCP leaders have been playing Kaun Banega Arabpati all these years. Did 15 years of Congress-NCP government do any good to you, to farmers, to the poor?”
Watch: Modi, sounds poll bugle, tells Haryana voters to oust Congress
“Believe me, I can change Mumbai and Maharashtra. This is the city where most terrorist attacks happened, where most communal riots happened. Who is responsible? Do you not want to get rid of this?”
Earlier, in Beed and Aurangabad in drought-affected central Maharashtra, he appealed to voters to work towards a majority government of the BJP.
At each of his rallies, the PM also made it a point to recall his American trip, telling people, “I think small, but I think of doing big things for small people. Did India’s name ever reverberate in the US before? It did this time, not because of Modi but because of its 125 crore people.”
The audience, hanging on to Modi’s every word, didn’t have time for other speakers. Karnal MP Ashwini Kumar Chopra Minna had to leave his address mid-way after being booed. “I know you all have come to listen to Modiji, I can talk to you some other day,” he said.
Empty vessels make the most noise: Sonia Gandhi
Barely two hours after his Karnal speech, Sonia hit out at Modi at a rally in Meham, saying “empty vessels make the most noise”.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence,” she said.
"Has inflation come down? Is the poor man getting food at cheaper rate? Have the unemployed got jobs?" she asked.
Over the next 10 days Modi will be on a campaign blitzkrieg in the two poll-bound states, with over 10 rallies in Haryana and more than 20 in Maharashtra.
With no local face in these two states, the BJP is banking heavily on him for campaigning, especially since the party split with its allies, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Haryana Janhit Congress in Haryana.

Patna stampede: Blame game begins  BJP wants CM Manjhi to quitThe Dussehra-day stampede which killed 33 people in Patna  has set off a blame game with opposition BJP and other party leaders holding the state government responsible.

Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and  Ram Vilas Paswan demanded the resignation of chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, saying the tragedy happened because the administration had no system in place.
Describing the tragedy as "regrettable and shameful", Ravi Shankar Prasad said the state government miserably failed to learn from past incidents.
Read: ‘Poor lighting led to the tragedy'
"There was a stampede during Chhath puja in 2012 and bomb explosions during Narendra Modi's rally in October last year. Still no proper arrangements were made," he said.
Prasad said the Centre would extend all help to the state government to deal with the situation. "I have already spoken to home minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Harsh Vardhan. A team of NDRF has already left for Patna to assist the state administration," he added.
Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, hitting out at the JD(U) government said: "There was no security, no lighting, one gate was open while more than five lakh people were present there and the police were there only to rain lathis on the hapless people."
"This is not the first time it has happened. The state government is insensitive and solely responsible for this.  It took hours for them to react. I will submit a report to Union home minister and the prime minister once I return," he said.
Watch: Patna stampede toll rises to 33, centre seeks report
Even RJD leader Lalu Prasad who supports the Manjhi government said it was an "administrative lapse" and that there were no foolproof crowd control measures despite past incidents.
"The Gandhi Maidan stampede appears to be a matter of administrative lapse ( sic).  Stern action should be taken against officials found guilty. I am keeping a watch over the event," Prasad tweeted.
Prasad said the RJD had been demanding the boundary wall of the Gandhi Maidan should be lowered and that there should be more entry and exit points to the grounds.
The Bihar government  meanwhile constituted a two man committee consisting of  principal home secretary Amir Shubhani and additional director general, headquarters Gupteshwar Pandey to probe the reasons for the stampede.
The investigation report will be submitted to the government and the ministry of home affairs within 24 hours, officials said.

Patna MP Shatrughan Sinha criticised the district administration for improper preparations and demanded an impartial probe  to bring the guilty to book.
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Tariq Anwar too demanded strict action against the officials responsible for the stampede.
JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav assured strict action against those responsible. "The incident will be probed and those found guilty of laxity and carelessness will face strong action," he said.
Thirty three people were killed, all of them due to suffocation, and 29 others injured in the stampede that happened towards the end of the Dussehra day celebrations on Friday evening.
Of the dead, 21 were women, 10 were minors and two men, according to the list available at the Patna Medical College Hospital.

Aurangabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the campaign for the assembly election from Beed district after paying homage to the late Rural Development Minister, Gopinath Munde and appealed to the voters to give a clear mandate the BJP for the sake of the development.
Modi tactically chose the hometown of Munde for the first ever election meeting to attract the backward classes who believed in his OBC leadership. The public meeting witnessed multitude of audience pouring in thousands to listen to the prime minister.
Addressing the crowd, Modi said "Munde was like my younger brother and had he been alive, there would not have been any need at all for me to undertake any public meeting in the state"
Modi tactically chose the hometown of Munde for the first election meeting to attract the backward classes.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #narendra modi #bjp #congress
In his first public rally, nowhere in his speech Modi mentioned the Shiv Sena or its 25 years old alliance with the BJP. With his silence towards the Shiv Sena, he made it clear that the BJP would like to ignore the Shiv Sena in this election. Moreover, Modi many a times appealed to the voters to give a clear majority to the BJP in Maharashtra. He said "I want to serve the state, but if you are going to close down the valve of the pipeline coming towards the state, I cannot help".
Accusing the Congress and NCP Government for the destruction of one generation in last the 15 years, Modi said that the Congress rule made mere changes in the chief ministership because the alliance parties were fighting for the cause of "Kaun Banega Arabopati", (competition to be multi-billionaire). Although, both parties are different their DNA is same in many aspects. He described the Rashtravadi Congress (NCP) as 'Bhrashtavadi' Congress. Modi alleged that the development of the state came to a standstill. The government could neither supply water nor uninterrupted electricity to the farmers, which resulted in creation of the 'Suicide State'.
Promising to take Maharashtra ahead of Gujarat, Modi said that the state is having rich tradition of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Hindavi Swarajya who fought against the empire with the help of handful of people. Modi said "I have no big vision, but I want to do big things for the common people and with that cause alone I was elected at the centre. I have received loud applaud in America not because of the personality of Modi but because I was the representative of 125 crores Indians who elected me with thumping majority".
Modi in his first public meeting remained very aggressive and even assertive in terms of snatching the power at the state on his own. It is also important that he has expressed full faith in Pankaja Munde-Palve and assured to give the railway services to those districts which has never seen a railway line. He has started his campaign from the most backward region instead of starting it from the state capital Mumbai. With his interactive style and scathing attacks on the Congress alliance government, it seems that Modi has taken the vow to change the scenario in favor of BJP.

Pension regulator forms 18-member advisory panel to help frame rulesPension regulator forms 18-member advisory panel to help frame rules
KR Srivats
R V Verma, Acting Chairman
Draft regulations in public domain for receiving stakeholder feedback
New Delhi, October 3:  
The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has set up an 18-member advisory committee to help frame regulations for developing a robust pensions system in the country.
The move comes eight months after the PFRDA law got notified on February 1 this year, giving the regulator the much-needed statutory backing.
The setting up of the advisory panel — Pension Advisory Committee (PAC) — is an important step and the final stage of structural arrangement for finalising the regulations for the pension sector, RV Verma, Acting Chairman of PFRDA, told BusinessLine here. With the setting up of the PAC, there will be a more focused and structured stakeholder consultation before regulations are finalised, he said.
As many as 12-13 draft regulations are currently under the process of receiving public feedback and these are then expected to go through the newly set up PAC before being taken up by the PFRDA Board for final approval, Verma said.
The draft regulations that had been already exposed to the public include pension funds management, points-of-presence regulations, aggregator regulations, customer grievance regulations and exit regulations.
“By end-November, we expect all the 12 regulations to be notified (after PFRDA Board approval),” Verma said. The newly set up PAC has drawn representatives from industry, Government departments, regulatory bodies, research outfits and also pension fund managers.
Some of the members of the PAC are Ajay Shah, Professor, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy; GN Bajpai, Chairman, National Pension Systems Trust; Ashu Suyash, Director, Association of Mutual Funds of India; Chandrajit Banerjee, Director-General of Confederation of Indian Industry; and PK Choudhury, Chairman and Group CEO, ICRA, a rating agency. Besides the 18 members, the PAC will have the PFRDA Chairman and PFRDA members as ex-officio chairperson and ex-officio members respectively. The banking sector is fully on board with representatives from the Reserve Bank of India (at the level of chief general manager) besides the Chief Executive of Indian Banks’ Association.
The panel also has representatives from the Clearing Corporation of India, National Stock Exchange, Labour Ministry, SBI Pension Funds, ICICI Prudential Pension Funds and NSDL e-governance Infrastructure.
Expanding market
Currently, PFRDA is not looking at bringing any structural change to the pension sector, but is clearly focused on the approach and philosophy of expanding the market.
“We are keen to expand the number of players in the pension space,” Verma said.

Bezos meets PM  wraps up India visitBezos meets PM, wraps up India visit
BS Reporter | New Delhi Oct 04, 2014 12:37 AM IST
Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of American e-commerce major Amazon, wrapped up his week-long India visit after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. That was Bezos' last stop in India, a market where the $75-billion company has aggressive expansion plans, before heading to the airport and flying to Seattle.
This was one of those rare occasions when the Amazon boss wore a dark suit and a tie, as he sat with Modi discussing the prospects of the e-commerce sector, the company's India plans and policy issues related to foreign investment and taxation, it is learnt. Amazon did not talk about what transpired in the meeting.
When Bezos was asked about his visit to India coinciding with Modi's trip to the US, the Amazon founder had said in an interview to Business Standard on Sunday, ''I know, we are keeping the world balanced.'' He did not tell he would meet Modi after the PM returned. Amazon did not reveal the meetings lined up with the government. ''I don't know yet, but I would always be happy to. We have a team that plans those things. '' Bezos had said he would ''always love to meet'' Modi.
He is very respected internationally and seen as a very practical and good leader, Bezos said.
Soon after the Bezos-Modi meeting early evening that lasted about half an hour, the Prime Minister's Office tweeted about it. Within minutes it was re-tweeted and commented on by hundreds of followers. One such follower said, ''Jeff to PM -- Sir I promise to keep wide range of Modi kurta on our home page with unbelievable discount !!!'' Another said, ''Narendra Modi and Jeff Bezoz pursued their goals without caring much for the chatter class. Respect to both''.
A source said that Bezos was accompanied by his top India team in his meeting with Modi. The PM, who has many times highlighted the growth prospects of Indian e-commerce for beating traditional trade, is learnt to have discussed foreign investment in this sector with Bezos. Currently, foreign investment is not permitted in Indian e-commerce, thereby forcing companies such as Amazon to operate the marketplace format in the country as against inventory-based model.
The foreign investment rules do not apply to the marketplace model because this is about offering a technology platform to retailers to sell their products, rather than storing, warehousing and selling itself in the inventory format. Tricky taxation rules also came up in the meeting with the PM as e-commerce companies including Amazon have faced the issue in the recent past, according to a source.   
Bezos has however said in his several interactions during the past week that though the common perception is that there are many obstacles in doing business in India, Amazon's experience has been different. But when asked whether doing business was easy in India, he said, ''doing business is not easy anywhere. Every country has its quirks, differences and uniqueness, and companies must work around them.
The picture of Bezos and Modi, posted by the PMO, shows the two laughing. Much has been talked about Bezos'explosive laugh, and it surely didn't escape Modi.

Two Critical Factors to Consider if You Want More Successreddit
You might think that I've completely lost it were I to start quoting to you from a Toltec shaman about financial and business success, but some truths about life and success are pretty constant.  In his book The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz MD tells us that:
"Action is about living fully.  Inaction is the way that we deny life. Inaction is sitting in front of the television every day for years because you are afraid to be alive and to take the risk of expressing what you are.....You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action.  Without action upon an idea, there will be no manifestation, no results and no reward."
Ruiz's book is subtitled A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom.  I think it's fair to say he intends to speak of personal freedom, but he has also, in his words, captured the primary requirement for obtaining personal financial freedom.  That is, taking action - getting started - actually doing something, anything, to move yourself towards a goal.  Or to coin a cliché, "Wishing won't make it so".
In observing our students for more than twenty years we have found that the willingness to take action is probably the single most important determinant of success.  It isn't money, smarts, good looks... just the willingness to take action.
Not every action we take will work.  Life isn't like that.  But if we can quickly identify and abandon mistakes, and move on, continuing to take action, the likelihood that we will be successful increases hugely.  Observing other people who are good at what we want to do, finding a knowledgeable mentor or obtaining a solid practical education will all help to avoid mistakes, but it is taking action that is always going to be at the core of success.
Another success factor of which we need to be constantly mindful, is the people with whom we surround ourselves.  In simple terms, we should associate with people who support us.  I know that some writers say that we should attempt to associate with folk who are already successful at what we are seeking to do.  While that is good advice, it's not always easy or practical.  We also have to be discerning enough to recognize good advice from bad.  What I mean in this context is focused on the word support.  This can be as simple as people who just aren't negative or discouraging about what we want to do or are doing.
I still remember when I quit smoking for the last time over 20 years ago how my friends who still smoked were dismissive of my endeavor.  It's a simple example, but I still consider that they were actually envious or confronted by the fact that I was attempting something that they wanted to do, but they were either too fearful of failure, or couldn't sum up the energy to do it themselves.  Other friends though, went out of their way to encourage me.  I don't remember anyone in my circle advising me how to quit, they just encouraged me, and it was a huge help.
So be very aware of what happens when you discuss your goals with those around you.  Good, cautious advice is always welcome from those who want us to succeed, but be very careful about spending too much time with those who mock or put down your efforts to improve your situation.  If you hear their negative comments too many times - words have power - you may begin to agree with them, which will be the death knell of your determination to succeed.  Choose to involve yourself instead, with those who encourage your efforts, even if they can't tell you what to do.  It will make a huge difference in the likelihood of you being mightily successful.

Harvard students receive racially charged death threat emails

New York: American law enforcement officials are investigating a "racially charged" death threat emailed to several hundred students of Harvard University that claimed an individual would come to the Ivy League institution and "shoot all of you" and "kill you individually".
Harvard University police are investigating the death threat and plan to increase its campus presence over the weekend.
The university's police has notified the FBI and local law enforcement agencies about the racially charged email, in which its author claimed that he or she would come to Harvard on Saturday at "11 clock" and "shoot all of you" and "kill you individually," according to a report in the Harvard Crimson.
Harvard University police are investigating the death threat and plan to increase its campus presence over the weekend.
Addressed to "All students at Harvard," the text of the emails included racist language and referred to their intended recipients as "slit-eyes."
Several of the emails' intended recipients appear to have Asian surnames.
The emails are alleged to have been sent by one Stephanie Nguyen, who claims to live in Boston.
The address from which the first email was received, however, identified the sender as Eduardo Nguyen. The email's time stamp indicates that it was sent at 4:44 pm Friday from a "hotmail.de" email address.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven Catalano said that while the university cannot verify whether the threat is real, the police plans to increase its campus presence on the weekend.
In a community advisory message, Catalano advised Harvard students to familiarize themselves with the US Department of Homeland Security's active shooter safety guidelines.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said it is supporting the Harvard police in its investigation.
"We are aware of the email and of the threats," Warnick said. "We are going to support HUPD as much as they need us. They'll obviously take the lead on this, but we are there to support."
The Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association and several other Asian cultural groups on campus had planned to co-host an event on the Asian American experience at Harvard on Saturday afternoon.

Grenade-like object on AI plane turns out to be plastic wrapperGrenade-like object on AI plane turns out to be plastic wrapper
PTI
PTI Air India officials also made it clear that the Boeing 747-40 was not the one which was kept on a stand-by for Prime Minister’s recent visit to the US.
New Delhi, Oct 4:  
A security drill today created a major scare and sent Air India and security officials into a tizzy after a grenade-like object was found on a Boeing 747 aircraft when it landed at Jeddah in the wee hours.
The object, earlier suspected to be a “defused grenade”, turned out to be only a “plastic wrapper”, an Air India official said, adding that the plane was checked by Jeddah airport security personnel and cleared for further operations.
The airline officials also made it clear that the Boeing 747-400, operating flight AI-965 on Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah route, was not the one which was kept on a stand-by for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the US.
The plane had been operating on the Delhi-Frankfurt route during this period, they said. The Prime Minister had undertaken a five-day visit to the US from September 25.
As soon as the jumbo jet landed at the Jeddah airport, the flight crew informed the local security agencies, who took over the aircraft and conducted a thorough check.
“After screening the aircraft and the object, which was found to be a plastic wrapper, the Jeddah airport security cleared the aircraft for further operations,” an Air India statement said. Earlier, sources had said the object was a defused grenade.
Official sources said this was part of a security drill carried out by the National Security Guards since the last week of September at select airports in the country to check the alertness of the crew and others concerned.
Air India has set up a committee under the chairmanship of its Joint Managing Director and Joint Commissioner of Security, Civil Aviation to further investigate the incident as also the alertness of the crew.
“Air India would like to clear that at no point of time was the safety of the passengers or the aircraft compromised,” the statement added.

(Yahoo recently acquired…)
By Michael J De La Merced and Mike Isaac
Yahoo, flush with cash from selling a portion of its stake in the Alibaba Group of China, appears ready to bet on what it believes will be the next big Internet phenomenon.
The company has held talks to invest in Snapchat, the extremely popular app that allows photos and messages to self-destruct, people briefed on the matter said Friday. The deal has not yet closed, some of these people added.
Should Yahoo make the investment, it will join a bevy of other prominent investors, including the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, that have valued the disappearing-photo service at about $10 billion.
While Yahoo is not expected to invest a huge amount of money in Snapchat, the investment could give it access to the messaging phenomenon and help Yahoo become more relevant to young consumer audiences once more. It would also give the company a more strategic stake in mobile technology, an area in which Yahoo has long been seen as a laggard compared with competitors like Facebook and Google.
Yahoo has been bolstered by a roughly $6 billion haul from selling a significant portion of its holdings in Alibaba, the fast-growing Chinese shopping behemoth that went public last month. At least half of the proceeds from the sale will go toward buying back stock, but some of the money could go toward strategic acquisitions and investments.
Talks between Yahoo and Snapchat gained steam late this summer, some of the people briefed on the matter said.
  In that vein, Yahoo recently acquired MessageMe, a small photo and text messaging startup in San Francisco, according to a person close to the company. It is yet another in a string of small mobile startup acquisitions for Yahoo, which began soon after Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, took the top position in 2012.
Yet that strategy could expose Yahoo to criticism from shareholders leery that the Alibaba windfall will lead to another spending spree. The activist hedge fund Starboard Value emerged as an investor in the company last week and pointedly demanded that Yahoo not pursue takeovers of debatable value like the $1.1 billion acquisition of the blogging site Tumblr.
Though Snapchat has garnered millions of regular users who send hundreds of millions of photos and videos every day, it has yet to generate any revenue.
The young company is celebrated in Silicon Valley circles, particularly for its popularity among the much-coveted millennial demographic. Snapchat, which is based in Venice, California, has raised upward of $160 million in venture capital; last fall, the company spurned a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook.
Snapchat has been experimenting with ways to distribute content on its popular network. It has worked with musicians, large brands and popular users on its network to figure out different ways to distribute "snaps" - the company's name for its disappearing messages - that will keep its member base coming back regularly.
This could be where the two companies see eye to eye. Mayer has repeatedly said that Yahoo is a "digital content company at its core" and has worked to bolster its content offerings. The company has commissioned two television-length comedy series that will air exclusively on Yahoo's mobile apps and website. Last fall, Mayer hired Katie Couric, the seasoned journalist who has been the anchor of news programs for NBC, CBS and ABC, to be Yahoo's global news anchor.
Couric recently attended a small private party thrown by Snapchat's founders during Advertising Week, an annual media industry event held in New York, according to a person familiar with the guest list.
Representatives for Yahoo and Snapchat declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on the fundraising talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

Maha polls: Modi attacks Cong  NCP over corruption | PM hits back at SoniaBJP
(As during his Lok Sabha poll…)
BEED(MAHARASHTRA): Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched an all out attack on the erstwhile ruling Congress-NCP combine in Maharashtra over corruption, accusing it of "destroying a whole generation" but refrained from criticising former ally Shiv Sena.
"It was a union where as the clock ticked, the hand polished off everything. Now nothing has been left. Every young person in Maharashtra is under a huge burden of debt because of corruption," he said, while referring to the election symbols of NCP and Congress which ended their 15-year-old alliance just before the elections .
"Nobody benefited from the Congress-NCP government. Farmers, dalits, youth, adivasis, women, villages, towns... none benefited.....a whole generation was destroyed," Modi said addressing his first election rally at Beed, the parliamentary constituency of former Union Minister Gopinath Munde, who died in a car crash earlier this year.
Describing Congress and NCP as two sides of the same coin, he said, "Amitabh hosts Kaun Banega Crorepati. The Maharashtra government used to play Kaun Banega Arabpati everyday" and urged people to vote for BJP to end corruption.
As during his Lok Sabha poll campaign, Modi once again drew comparison between Gujarat and Maharashtra over development.
"Maharashtra is like an elder brother. We (Gujarat and Maharashtra) were together once. You (the people) gave political stability to them (Congress-NCP) but they did not care and now Maharashtra is known for all the wrong reasons.
"I want to take Maharashtra ahead of Gujarat. I want it to be at the top of all states, but for that I need a government from which I can take work," Modi said.
Though he did not even once refer to Shiv Sena, whith which BJP parted ways over seat sharing, in his 25-minute speech, Modi invoked Maratha king Shivaji, the enduring icon of that party.
"This is the land of Chhatrapati Shivaji. His success lay in creating Hindavi Swaraj with the help of small people. People ask me what is my vision. I tell them I am a small man and think small things for small people. These small people have now given me the power to do big things for them while seated in Delhi," he said.
Hitting back at Congress president Sonia Gandhi , who attacked his government over inflation and price rise earlier in the day, Modi said, "Those who ruled for 60 years are demanding the account of what my government did in 60 days. Petrol and diesel prices are down. I promise you I will pull the country out of the current mess in 60 months."
"Has inflation come down? Is the poor man getting food at cheaper rate? Have the unemployed got jobs?" Sonia had said addressing an election rally in Haryana.
Targeting Congress which had described his US visit as 'over hyped and disappointing', Modi asked, "Was India's presence ever felt in the US like this?".
"It is not because of Modi but because of 1.25 crore countrymen. No country can afford to ignore a man behind whom 1.25 crore people stand. Today, the ruler and the society stand together," he said.
Referring to his Summit-level meetings with world leaders, he said both China and Japan would set up state-of-the-art industrial parks in states including Maharashtra. Japan, he said, will cooperate in construction of high-speed railway between Mumbai and Ahmedabad.
"All these will create large-scale employment," he said, adding the deal with China for solid waste management and waste water treatment will provide water for irrigation in villages of drought prone regions like Beed.
Without naming NCP chief Sharad Pawar , Modi said nothing was done to stop farmers suicide in Maharashtra when he was Union Agriculture Minister.
"Those who did farmers' politics in Delhi did not do anything to prevent the suicides. 3700 farmers kill themselves each year in the state. Will the farmers of Maharashtra be continued to be murdered like this?" he said.
"There is no difference between Congress and NCP, they belong to the same clan. They set separate shops for some reason but their character, ideology, habits and goals are one. They are not nationalists, they are 'bhrashtacharvadi' (corrupt)," he said.
Modi repeatedly invoked Munde, a prominent backward class leader of Maharashtra, whom he called his younger brother, to seek a majority for BJP and its four smaller allies during the Assembly poll.
Munde's elder daughter Pankaja is BJP candidate for Parli Assembly seat, while her younger sister Preetam is contesting by-poll for Beed Lok Sabha seat lying vacant following the death of their father.

NEW DELHI: Air India officials said an object discovered in an Air India's Boeing 747 aircraft in Jeddah was just a plastic cover of a stun grenade, but aviation minister Ashok Gajapati Raju Pusapati said the object was indeed a stun grenade. "A plastic cover of a stun grenade used by security during the anti-terror drills carried out in a plane. It is a completely harmless object," said a senior Air India official. As soon as the jumbo jet landed at the Jeddah airport, the flight crew informed the local security agencies, who took over the aircraft and conducted a thorough check. Following the incident, Air India has suspended the security managers of Mumbai and Hyderabad.

Travel industry body International Air Transport Association (IATA) Friday said India’s domestic market increased by 7.4 per cent in August over 2013.
“Results for the last two months have been solid, perhaps an early sign of improvement as a result of the new business-supportive government regime,” IATA said in a statement.
According to IATA, India’s domestic demand rose 4.5 per cent in the month under review compared to August 2013.
“August was a good month right across the industry. All regions reported an expansion in demand for air travel. We should, however, keep an eye on potential downside risks,” said Tony Tyler, director general and chief executive, IATA.
Data furnished by the civil aviation ministry, showed that domestic air passenger traffic increased by 8.31 per cent in August to 56.97 lakh passengers-up from 52.60 lakh ferried in the corresponding month last year.
On a month-on-month basis there was an increase of over five per cent in the passenger traffic.
“Passengers carried by domestic airlines during Jan-Aug 2014 were 433.25 lakh as against 411.40 lakh during the corresponding period of previous year, thereby registering a growth of 5.31 per cent,” the ministry had said in a statement.
The data showed that low-cost carrier IndiGo achieved the highest market share at 32.6 per cent followed by SpiceJet at 19.5 per cent, Air India at 16.2 per cent, Jet Airways at 16.1 per cent, Go Air at 10 per cent, and JetLite at 4 per cent.
Regional carriers AirAsia India reported a market share of 0.06 per cent and Air Costa at 1.1 per cent.

Hollywood pay: It s good to be Iron ManHollywood pay: It's good to be Iron Man
By Frank Pallotta   @frankpallotta October 3, 2014: 7:15 PM ET
 
Celebs can earn $1M a day for voice work
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
When it comes to Hollywood salaries, it's good to be Iron Man.
According to the Hollywood Reporter , Robert Downey Jr. pulled in $75 million last year thanks to his endorsements and a stake in "Iron Man 3."
As the face of the invincible Tony Stark, Downey has ensured that Marvel's highly lucrative "Iron Man" and "Avengers" series can't be made without him. It's also one the main reasons the actor had heated contract negotiations with Marvel last year.
Downey isn't the only action hero making a ton of money, however.
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson netted $52 million while "Taken" actor Liam Neeson took in $40 million.
Top stars like Leonardo DiCaprio make big bucks, even if they don't play action heroes.
DiCaprio made $25 million only for "The Wolf of Wall Street." But there is a bit of a drop off between A-list stars and mid-level actors.
For example:
Co-star Jonah Hill was paid only $60,000, while working on a minimum salary for the role.
Some female actors weren't that far behind.
Jennifer Lawrence made $35 million last year, thanks in most part to her role in the $1.5 billion "Hunger Games" series .
Katniss Everdeen didn't just help Lawrence's bank balance, but also that of Jon Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate, the film's distributor.
Feltheimer made $63.6 million, second only to CBS ( CBS ) CEO Les Moonves' $66.9 million. For Feltheimer it was a 504% jump in annual earnings.
One surprising takeaway from the report was the big money earned by actors for voice-over work in commercials.
Even though they make up just 20% of the voices in commercials, actors like Jon Hamm (whose voice stars in Mercedes commercials) can get upwards of $1 million an ad for just a day's work.
Halle Berry makes $150,000 an episode (or $3.3 million for a full season) for the TV show "Extant" on CBS.
But some other TV stars command much more dollars. Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, and Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting now make $1 million per episode after signing new three-year deals earlier this year for "The Big Bang Theory" also on CBS.

Stolen Harley returned after 42 yearsStolen Harley returned after 42 years

A stolen Harley-Davidson is returned after 42 years.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Edgar Howard Johnson, Jr. still remembers the time his father picked him up from school on a Harley-Davidson ( HOG ).
"When the kids asked me if I was going to ride on that, I told them I sure am," Johnson said this week after Customs and Border Protection agents returned the motorcycle, which was stolen 42 years ago.
The 1954 FL Harley-Davidson Hydra-Glide motorcycle was intercepted last month at the Los Angeles/Long Beach seaport, where it was about to be shipped to Australia.
Investigators with the California Highway Patrol discovered that the bike had been stolen from a police officer in North Carolina in 1972.
"My dad would be tickled to get it back if he was still alive," said Johnson, whose father passed away four years ago. "I miss my dad so much. This is like a piece of him is coming back home."

The Harley, worth an estimated $24,000, appeared to be in mint condition. It was green when stolen but was since painted bright yellow. It also has a "trumpet style horn" and a medallion on its front fender commemorating Harley-Davidson's 50th anniversary.
Finding and returning long stolen vehicles are starting to become du jour. Only recently, customs agents returned a 1967 convertible Jaguar XKE to its rightful owner 46 years after it had been stolen. The two-door convertible was discovered in a container that was going to the Netherlands.

The tragedy occurred when people were returning after watching the "Ravan Vadh" ceremony at the main Dussehra event at Gandhi Maidan.
A stampede at a Ram Leela ceremony in Patna on Friday has killed 32 people and injured over 15 others. The incident occurred as people were returning after the Ravan Vadh at the Gandhi Maidan here. The injured have been admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spoke to Chief Ministe Jitan Ram Manjhi about the incident, has announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the families of the dead.

The probe team has been asked to submit the report within 24 hours
Rumours sparked panic
The stampede at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan following the Ram Leela ceremony on Friday was apparently triggered by rumours that an electrical wire had snapped, leading to panic as the people were leaving the venue near the Maurya Lok Hotel.
Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manji was present at the Gandhi Maidan along with a large number of people who had gathered to see the Ravan vadh on the occasion of Vijaydashmi, the last day of Dussehra.

In Ferguson  the fervor of the street is moving to the ballot boxBut will they vote?((AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File))

Daniel A. Medina @dmedin11
October 4, 2014
As protesters took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri following the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, one of their central demands was more equal representation in local government. Though more than two-thirds of Ferguson’s residents are African-American, 94% of the city’s police force is white. Only one of its six city council members is African-American.
Civil rights leader Al Sharpton addressed the city government’s skewed racial makeup in a speech at Brown’s funeral, calling on  Ferguson residents to begin a movement that would “turn our chants into change, our demonstration into legislation.” That movement, he said, would begin at the ballot box.
Turns out, voter registration in Ferguson has jumped nearly 30%  since Aug. 9, the day Brown was killed. Rita Days, director of the St. Louis County Board of Elections, told Reuters that nearly 3,300 Ferguson residents—out of a population of 21,000—had registered to vote between Aug. 9 and Sept. 30. There are three city council seats in Ferguson up for election next April.
“I believe people had something akin to an epiphany after Michael Brown,” John Gaskin III, spokesperson for the St. Louis County chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), tells Quartz. “People opened their eyes to what was happening in their local governments and thought, ‘This is what happens when I don’t make my voice heard.’”
Brown says African-Americans and people of color, both in St. Louis and nationally, “cannot afford to sit at home on Election Day.”
The NAACP is a national non-partisan organization, though most of its members identify with the Democratic Party. A Democrat has held the office of the St. Louis County chief executive, the most powerful elected position in the county that includes Ferguson, for the past 25 years.
However, the new surge of voters in Ferguson will not all benefit the Democratic Party. On Thursday, over 30 local Democratic elected officials from across the county announced a coalition that endorsed the opposition Republican candidate , Rick Stream, in next month’s election for chief executive. The Fannie Lou Hamer Coalition of St. Louis County, named after the iconic Mississippi civil rights leader, said in a statement  that “after years and years of disrespect” by Democratic Party leaders, African American political leaders could no longer be “oblivious to the obvious.”
 “Ferguson was a turning point, a tragedy that brought about a civic revolution in the black community in this state…” 
The move was met with bewilderment by both state and national Democrats, said Terry Wilson, president of a school board district that borders Ferguson and a member of the Hamer coalition.
“Ferguson was a turning point, a tragedy that brought about a civic revolution in the black community in this state and our votes will no longer be taken for granted,” Wilson tells Quartz. “A lot of people are educating themselves on their rights and they intend to vote, some for the first time, on election day.”
For Wilson, the coalition should be a wake-up call to national Democrats in Washington. “If Democrats here or anywhere are not going to listen to us [black communities], we’re not going to vote for you.”

Man kills gay partner after latter attacks his mother for opposing theirrelationshipPress Trust of India | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 4, 2014 7:20 pm
An 18-year-old youth shot dead his homosexual partner here on Saturday after the latter attacked his mother for opposing their relationship, police said.
“The youth shot his homosexual partner killing him on the spot when he tried to kill the accused’s mother following an argument,” inspector P D Parmar said.
The incident took place at Chauhan’s house in Chunvalnagar slum in Bapu Nagar area.
According to police, the deceased went to Mehul’s house on Saturday and had an argument with his partner’s mother about why she objected to their same-sex relationship. During the argument he pulled out a country-made revolver and shot her.
“When the accused saw this, he snatched the revolver from his hand and fired three rounds at him, killing him on the spot,” the inspector said.
The duo had been in a relationship for a year.
The accused’s mother was injured seriously and was undergoing treatment at a government hospital, Parmar said adding, the youth has been arrested. Police is further investigating the issue.

British PM david Cameron says hostage killing unforgivableThe Prime Minister is meeting with officials from intelligence agencies, the military and the Foreign Office to discuss the killings. (Source: AP)
Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 4, 2014 7:17 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 7:25 pm
Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the brutal murder of another British hostage by Islamic State (IS) militants as “completely unforgivable” and vowed to bring his killers to justice.
He said the murder of taxi driver Alan Henning is “abhorrent and senseless” after a video purporting to show the 47-year-old father of two being beheaded by militants emerged last night.
The Salford taxi driver was delivering aid to Syria in December when he was kidnapped and then held hostage by IS.
Cameron described him as a “kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man”.
“The murder of Alan Henning is absolutely abhorrent, it is senseless, it is completely unforgivable. Anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is, and barbaric it is,” he said of IS.
The Prime Minister is meeting with officials from intelligence agencies, the military and the Foreign Office at his official country residence Chequers to discuss the killing, Downing Street said.
The footage shows Henning kneeling beside a knifeman dressed in black in a desert setting.
It is the second such murder of a UK hostage after fellow aid worker David Haines was killed last month.
Two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, were also beheaded by the terrorist organisation, which is also known as Isil.
Cameron, who last night arrived back in the UK after visiting British troops including those engaged in air strikes on IS in Iraq, said: “The brutal murder of Alan Henning by Isil shows just how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are.
“My thoughts and prayers (tonight) are with Alan’s wife Barbara, their children and all those who loved him.
“We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice.”
The gruesome video appears to show Henning, who is dressed in orange, say: “I am Alan Henning. Because of our Parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision.”
The killer, who speaks with a British accent and is believed to be the man responsible for the previous beheadings, then makes a direct statement to the British Prime Minister: “The blood of David Haines was on your hands, Cameron. Alan Henning will also be slaughtered, but his blood is on the hands of the British Parliament.”

Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah will celebrate Eid-ul Azha with simplicity keeping in mind the plight of people in flood-ravaged areas and has asked his supporters to help flood survivors on the holy occasion.
“Omar wishes that instead of visiting his residence on Eid for greeting him, people should remain associated with flood survivors providing them necessary succour on the holy occasion,” an official spokesman said.
“The chief minister will celebrate Eid with simplicity observing no gaiety and joy due to the plight of lakhs of people affected by the devastating flood in Jammu and Kashmir claiming precious human lives and inflicting losses to the economy,” the spokesman said.
The chief minister has appealed to his supporters and well wishers to remain in their areas and share Eid with flood sufferers by extending support of all kinds.
Eid will be celebrated in Kashmir on Monday, exactly a month after floods devastated many parts of the state including the summer capital Srinagar.

He was asked about 79-year-old Chautala, who is on bail on health grounds following his conviction last year in a teacher recruitment scandal, canvassing for his party candidates for the October 15 polls in Haryana.
The Delhi High Court had sought the response of CBI and Chautala by October 10 on a plea for directions to the politician to immediately surrender.
The plea contended that Chautala intends to "misuse the grace period of 17 days given to him to surrender" by planning to campaign during that period.
The CEC said, "Under the law a political party names its star campaigner and the commission takes note of it and we have been informed that he (Chautala) is his party's star campaigner.
"People should approach competent court for an appropriate action (against Chautala)," he said.
Former Haryana Chief Minister Chautala had on Friday campaigned for his party candidate from Uchana in Jind district of Haryana. He continued with the canvassing for the second consecutive day today.
INLD is fighting a do-or-die battle for the Assembly polls in alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) after being out of helm of affairs for a decade.

Aviation Minister contradicts Air India  says dummy stun-grenade on plane; probe on9
0
New Delhi: In an embarrassment for Air India, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Saturday disclosed that a dummy stun-grenade was found on board an Air India jumbo plane when it landed at Jeddah in the early hours.
The stun grenade, which had no explosive in it, was found on the upper deck business class of the Boeing 747-400, which was operating flight AI-965 on Mumbai-Hyderabad-Jeddah route, official sources said, adding that the aircraft was taken to a remote bay, checked by the local security personnel and later granted operational clearance.
"The grenade may have remained after the mock drill...It has BSF markings," Raju told reporters at Vizianagaram. The security drill was carried out by National Security Guards between September 24-27 at select airports and aircraft across the country to check the alertness of the crew and others concerned.

Terming the incident as "unacceptable", he said though there was no threat to passengers, "there is some failure and this lapse may not be condoned. Corrective measures have to be taken."
The minister's statement came hours after an Air India press release said "after screening the aircraft and the object which was found to be a plastic wrapper, the Jeddah airport security cleared the aircraft for further operations."
A joint team of Air India and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security was rushed to Mumbai in the morning which was investigating the incident and questioning those concerned in order to fix responsibility, the official sources said.
Just before landing in Jeddah, they said a box, wrapped in plastic, rolled out from beneath one of the business class seats. The cabin crew saw it and immediately informed the pilot who informed the Jeddah air traffic control.
On landing, the pilots were asked to take the plane to a remote bay where the security personnel took out the grenade and found it not having any explosive, the sources said.
The grenade carried markings like 'Anti-Riot Stun Grenade' and produced at BSF's Tekanpur-based Tear Smoke Unit, with officials suspecting that it could have been left behind after the security drill carried out last month.
As an aircraft passes through various checks and cleaning  prior to be airborne in which different sections of staff are involved, they are also responsible for seeing that such items are not there on board, the sources said.
They said the entire issue was being thoroughly probed and responsibilities would be fixed after the enquiry.
This plane was not the one was kept as a stand-by for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the US and it had been operating on the Delhi-Frankfurt route during this period, they said. The Prime Minister had undertaken a five-day visit to the US from September 25.

Modi kicks off BJP s election campaign  says Cong has ruined an entire generationComments
Five months after a highly successful Lok Sabha election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is back to doing what he does best — working the crowds, wooing them with his one-liners and boundless energy. His request: absolute majority for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana.

Kicking off his campaign for the October 15 assembly polls on Saturday, Modi slipped easily into his role of champion vote-seeker at his first rally of the day — in the northern state’s Karnal district. Accusing the ruling Congress and opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) of neglecting farmers and promoting goondaism, he appealed to voters to give the BJP a chance.
Alleging irregularities in land allotment, he asked, “Who among the poor has got a plot? ...But where have thousands of acres of land disappeared, who has taken this? Does Haryana want to settle the account?”
In a veiled attack on the INLD, he asked the people if they would like to be governed from jail. INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, serving a jail sentence in a corruption case but currently out on bail, had said he’d take oath as CM from Tihar.

Promising development and jobs, he hinted that Karnal may be part of his 100 smart cities project. And carrying forward his Swachh Bharat mission, he said, “We may be living in the age of Hi-Fi and Wi-Fi but safai (cleanliness) is equally important.”
Ending the day in Mumbai, he told a crowd at the Mahalaxmi Race Course, “Mumbai and Maharashtra’s growth is important for the country’s growth. I can’t leave Mumbai helpless any longer. The city is the birthplace of the BJP, which has achieved so much in such a short time.”
Attacking the ruling Congress and its ally, the NCP, but choosing to ignore former ally Shiv Sena, Modi said, “Amitabh Bachchan hosts a TV show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, but these Congress and NCP leaders have been playing Kaun Banega Arabpati all these years. Did 15 years of Congress-NCP government do any good to you, to farmers, to the poor?”
Watch: Modi, sounds poll bugle, tells Haryana voters to oust Congress
“Believe me, I can change Mumbai and Maharashtra. This is the city where most terrorist attacks happened, where most communal riots happened. Who is responsible? Do you not want to get rid of this?”
Earlier, in Beed and Aurangabad in drought-affected central Maharashtra, he appealed to voters to work towards a majority government of the BJP.
At each of his rallies, the PM also made it a point to recall his American trip, telling people, “I think small, but I think of doing big things for small people. Did India’s name ever reverberate in the US before? It did this time, not because of Modi but because of its 125 crore people.”
The audience, hanging on to Modi’s every word, didn’t have time for other speakers. Karnal MP Ashwini Kumar Chopra Minna had to leave his address mid-way after being booed. “I know you all have come to listen to Modiji, I can talk to you some other day,” he said.
Empty vessels make the most noise: Sonia Gandhi
Barely two hours after his Karnal speech, Sonia hit out at Modi at a rally in Meham, saying “empty vessels make the most noise”.
“They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence,” she said.
"Has inflation come down? Is the poor man getting food at cheaper rate? Have the unemployed got jobs?" she asked.
Over the next 10 days Modi will be on a campaign blitzkrieg in the two poll-bound states, with over 10 rallies in Haryana and more than 20 in Maharashtra.
With no local face in these two states, the BJP is banking heavily on him for campaigning, especially since the party split with its allies, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Haryana Janhit Congress in Haryana.

CBI moves Delhi HC seeking cancellation of former Haryana CM Chautala bailOct 04, 2014 at 08:14pm IST
CBI moves Delhi HC seeking cancellation of former Haryana CM Chautala bail

New Delhi: CBI on Saturday moved Delhi High Court seeking immediate cancellation of the bail to former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala over his alleged violation of the conditions set for the same.
Sources in CBI said the agency had approached high court as Chautala, who was granted bail on medical grounds, has allegedly violated its terms by participating in election rallies.
The 79-year-old Indian National Lok Dal chief, who has been convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail in a teachers' recruitment scam case, was granted bail in May this year on medical grounds.
Chautala has been convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail in a teachers' recruitment scam case.

Following repeated violations of bail conditions, which were brought to the notice of court by CBI, Chautala had volunteered on Sept. 26 that he would surrender after which he was directed to surrender on Oct. 17.
Four-time Haryana chief minister Chautala volunteered to surrender as the court was about to order the constitution of a medical board of AIIMS doctors to consider the necessity of keeping Chautala hospitalised.
CBI has informed court that Chautala addressed a rally at Jind in Haryana on Sept. 25, the sources said. Haryana goes to polls on Oct. 15.
In its petition, CBI has prayed for immediate cancellation of bail of Chautala and sought his return to jail.
Delhi High Court had yesterday issued a notice to CBI on a petition seeking immediate cancellation of Chautala's bail on the grounds that he would "misuse the grace period of 17 days given to him to surrender" by taking part in campaigning.
A special CBI court on Jan. 22, 2013, had convicted and sentenced Chautala, his son Ajay and eight others to 10 years in jail for their role in the illegal recruitment of 3,206 junior teachers in 2000.
Among the others convicted in the case, 44 were sentenced to four years in jail while one was handed a five-year prison term. All of them were found guilty of cheating, forgery, using fake documents and conspiracy under IPC and of abusing their official position under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Chautala was chief minister for six months between 1980 and 1990, five days in July 1990 and for 14 days in 1991. Finally, he had a complete five year tenure starting in 1999.

Premium segment pushes cycle salesPremium segment pushes cycle sales
Mayank Mishra | New Delhi Oct 04, 2014 09:39 PM IST
Ghaziabad businessman Gurvinder Singh's recent acquisitions include two bicycles, one for his wife and another for his son. He did not mind paying Rs 12,000 for a cycle he bought for his wife eight months ago as he thinks "regular cycling enhances fitness". "We have maids at home to take care of the household work. My wife has a car to herself, which means she hardly gets to walk. Going to a gym was an option. But we decided to go in for a cycle to ensure that she stays fit," says Gurvinder, sitting at a badminton court waiting for his turn to play.
Gurvinder is one of several thousand urban Indians who are increasingly turning towards the cycle to improve their fitness. Although a nascent trend, cycle manufacturers have already reshuffled their product portfolio to cash in on this. "On day one of our journey, we started with production of 100 cycles a day. 70 of those were, what we call, black cycles and another 30 fancy cycles. Today after 12 years, we produce 3,000 cycles a day and 70 per cent of them are fancy (premium) cycles," says Sachin Lakra, executive director of SK Bikes.
Last year, SK Bikes opened seven exclusive cycle showrooms in places like Ludhiana, Bhatinda, Patan, Rohtak and Bhubaneshwar. Eight more showrooms are planned this year. His fancy cycle range starts from Rs 3,000 and goes up to Rs 8,000. The company is set to launch a premium range starting at Rs 10,000 next month and Lakra expects to sell 15,000-20,000 cycles a month.
Bicycle manufacturers are estimated to sell nearly 15 million cycles every year, 60 per cent of them standard cycles. This segment has seen a fall of three to five per cent in recent years. Manufacturers say that but for bulk orders from the state governments of Bihar and Tamil Nadu, this segment is clearly on the decline. And companies work on wafer-thin margins to sell standard cycles. The major players include Hero Cycles, Avon, TI, Cross, Firefox and SK Bikes. Hero Cycles is the market leader by far.
"While the overall market is not growing, customers are shifting to the so-called fancy bikes. Use, too, is changing. Earlier, the bulk of standard cycles was for bread earners," says S K Rai of Hero Cycles. Now, the demand comes from school children and for leisure, he adds.
The premium segment, therefore, has caught the fancy of manufacturers. It caters to two social groups: children and fitness conscious urban Indians. "The premium range of bicycles has come to be associated with fitness and recreation. There are cycle clubs in cities raising awareness about the eco-friendly nature of cycles. Then the concept of home gyms too has picked up in recent years," observes Gaurav Munjal, managing director of Heroeco. His company sells its premium range under the brand name of Cross. Cross cycles have shown a healthy growth in excess of 25 per cent in recent years, he adds.
Some citizens' initiatives too have helped cycle manufacturers. Raahgiri Day, observed in Gurgaon every Sunday starting November 2013, encourages people to cycle, walk or use public transport. It is now observed at Delhi's Connaught Place too. Cycle manufacturers also say that initiatives like the one taken by Infosys, asking its employees only to use bicycles inside its campus, have helped them in their quest to reach out to affluent urban consumers.
"The real challenge for all the companies now is to capture a bigger share in the premium segment. The volume still comes from the standard segment. But the premium segment is where the margin is," says Sameer Mehta, general manager (sales and marketing), Heroeco.
Premium cycles have aluminium bodies and come with multi-speed gears. They are designed differently too. Most companies rely on importing critical components from China and assembling them here. "We have an in-house group of professional cyclists. We rely on their inputs to change specifications," says Gaurav Munjal.
For bicycles made for children, companies are also relying on increasing sales of accessories to push up profitability. "I purchased a cycle for my son for Rs 8,000. One day he told me to get it fitted with gears as he saw them in his friends' cycles. That cost me an additional Rs 2,000. Then I purchased a helmet, which cost me Rs 1,800. I ended up paying almost half of what I paid to buy the cycle in buying accessories," says Amit Parashar who works for a multinational company in Noida.

Mysore celebrates Dasara without its MaharajaOct 04, 2014 at 10:39am IST

Mysore: City of palaces Mysore is celebrating its famous 10-day Dasara festival in the absence of scion Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, who passed away last December in Bangalore.
For the first time in many years, the royal family was forced to place the royal sword on the golden throne on which the scion used to sit and conduct the festival rituals in the Amba Vilas Palace durbar since he succeeded his father and last Mysore Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar in 1974.
As the royal family is yet to appoint a successor to the scion, his nephew Chaduranga Kantharaj Urs performed the day-long rituals, including Ayudha puja (worshipping of weapons) on Friday, ahead of Vijayadashmi (victory day) Saturday.
For the first time in many years, the royal family was forced to place the royal sword on the golden throne on which the scion used to sit .
#mysore dasara #mysore #dussehra #karnataka
Urs is son of Gayatri Devi, elder sister of the scion and eldest daughter of Jayachamarajendra.
"Scion's absence has robbed the Dasara fete of its grandeur, as the royal family members, especially his widow Pramoda Devi is yet to recover from his grievous loss. As it is a solemn occasion, the festival is being celebrated privately for continuity," a palace official in-charge of the fest told IANS here.
Unlike in the previous years, the private jamboo savari (elephant procession) was held on Friday within the precincts of the royal palace and ahead of the official victory procession across the city Saturday.
As part of the rituals, the royal sword was placed in a silver palanquin on a caparisoned jumbo that went around the sprawling palace along with 11 other elephants, passing by the aBanni' tree at the Bhuvaneshwari temple near the Jayamarthanada gate.
"The private jamboo savari was held a day in advance of the aNada Habba' (state-government's sponsored fest) on the advice of the palace priests at the auspicious time (5:30pm) decided according to the constellation of stars," the official said.
Meanwhile, hectic preparations are underway for the Saturday's grand finale of the Dasara fest, which includes the avictory' procession of caparisoned elephants, camels and horses from the palace to the Bannimantap ground, 5km away across the city.
As head of the state government, chief minister Siddaramaiah will flag off the procession by offering flowers to the idol of goddess Chamundeshwari in the 750kg golden howdah (throne) mounted on elephant Arjuna at the main palace gate.The procession will be followed by 45 tableaux, cultural troupes, NCC cadets, personnel of KSRP, railway police, and home guards amid tight security.
The grand finale will culminate with a torchlight parade at the Bannimantap ground Saturday evening in the presence of state governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala and other dignitaries.
Thousands of people, including tourists from across the country and abroad have descended on the cultural capital of the state to witness the event, marking the triumph of good over evil on the 10th day of Dasara fest.

Patna: Locals blame police as 33 killed in Dussehra stampede  high level probe ordered4
0
Patna: At least 33 people have been killed and several injured in a stampede that took place during Dusshera celebrations on Friday night. Soon after the incident, the locals blamed the district police for keeping the exits shut after the celebrations which led to the stampede.
The half-km stretch of the road from Gandhi Maidan to Exhibition Road and about same distance upto Kargil Chowk was littered with shoes, slippers and other objects abandoned by the fleeing crowd panicked by the rumours of a live overhead electricity wire falling on them.
Eyewitnesses claim that they saw people desperately jostling with each other to exit. "Only two out of the 11 gates at the sprawling maidan were kept open for the exit," an onlooker said.
#patna #patna stampede #narendra modi #jitan ram manjhi
"Panic gripped the people after some youths shouted 'bhago bhago' triggering stampede as scores of helpless women and children fell down and got trampled under the feet of crowd running for their lives. I could not rescue them, could have been women of my family and my sons/daughters," he said.
Locals also slammed the police for making inadequate security arrangements for the people, particularly for their exit saying that no cops were present on the southern side of the Gandhi Maidan to regulate traffic and movement of people. "But for inept policing, loss of large number of lives could have been prevented," he said and hinted that the toll must be much higher than being accounted by the administration.
Witnesses also say that there was little space for the people on the road as vehicles of district police and VIPs were parked on the road on South-East corner of Gandhi maidan. While scores of people ran for their life from an exit gate on way to Kargil Chowk, a large crowd tried to make way to the Exhibition road where many people, including women and children, met their tragic end.
The narrowness of space on Exhibition road due to construction of a flyover was a major reason for high number of causalities, those present testified. There was inadequate street light on South-East side of Gandhi Maidan as people ran for life and in the process fell on each other in the darkness, the eyewitnesses said.
"There was a rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over in the frenzy," Patna District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma said.
Even the situation at the Maidan later on was not found to be any better as there was total darkness in the premise after the stampede with the state government and district administration shifting their focus on the PMCH where the injured revellers have been taken for treatment and on the streets for security reasons.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday spoke to Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi to review the situation of the stampede. Singh has sought a report from the state government on the incident. A high level probe has been ordered into the incident.
The tragedy struck at around 7 PM at the South East corner of the ground near the Exhibition road when people were returning after watching the "Ravana Vadh" (killing of demon king) event and jostled with each other to move ahead, eyewitnesses and officials said.

Ask Matt: Can I profit from hackersGetty
Q: Can I profit from hackers?
A: Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important as big companies see their systems get breached. Investors are looking for ways to profit from this emerging trend.
Shares of companies involved in high-end cybersecurity jumped Friday following the report of a July breach of JP Morgan Chase’s systems. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) jumped $6.52, or 6.6% to $104.70 and Vasco Data Security (VDSI) added $1.46, or 7.8%, to $20.21.
Cybersecurity is definately a nascent area. The biggest player in the industry is Symantec (SYMC) , which commands a $16 billion market value. Wall Street analysts aren’t as bullish on that stock though, seeing smaller players as bigger sources of growth. FireEye (FEYE) continues to be one of the Wall Street analysts’ favorite plays in the security industry. Analysts see the stock going to $44 over the next 18 months, which would be more an a 50% increase from Friday’s closing price of $28.19. But cybersecurity is a fast-moving industry that’s best suited for speculators and traders. Even the pros can’t decide on which stocks are the best values. A more prudent approach for those that want to buy into security might be a basket of stocks, such as Motiv Investing’s Cyber Security portfolio. The portfolio owns 15 cyber security stocks, spreading your money around.

Who is Prof. Thomas Kailath 10 things you must knowWho is Prof. Thomas Kailath? 10 things you must know
BS Web Team | Mumbai Oct 04, 2014 04:35 PM IST
Professor Thomas Kailath was on Friday awarded US National Medal of Science, widely considered the pinnacle of scientific achievement in that country, with past winners including Steve Jobs and Dave Packard, among others. The awards are announced by the incumbent President, in this case Barack Obama, who said in statement that "These scholars and innovators have expanded our understanding of the world, made invaluable contributions to their fields, and helped improve countless lives.”
 
Here are 10 things you must know about the 79-year-old Prof. Kailath: 
 
Professor Thomas Kailath received his Bachelor of Engineering (Telecom) at the College of Engineering in Poona (now Pune) in 1956, and moved to the US the next year after being accepted at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA, for a Master’s, and then doctorate, degree. 
He becomes only the sixth person of Indian origin to receive the award. Others who have got it before him are New York University’s Srinivasa S.R. Varadhan (Probability Theory), Purdue University’s Rakesh Agrawal (Energy Innovations), and North Carolina State Univeristy’s B. Jayant Baliga (Energy Innovations), Calyampudi R. Rao (Mathematical and Computer Sciences), and Arun Netravali (Technology).
He became a naturalised citizen of the US in 1976; along the way, he married Sarah Kailath (nee) Jacob in 1962, with whom he had three children – Ann, Paul and Priya. In 1992, he established the Sarah Kailath Chair in India Studies at the University of Berkeley, California. Sarah passed away in 2008 after an extended battle with cancer. 
He joined Stanford University in California as an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering in 1963 and made full Professor in1968. In 1988, he became the first holder of the Hitachi America Professorship, a position he held through June 2001. A month later, he was recalled to the position in an Emeritus position that he continues to enjoy. 
Prof. Kailath’s research and teaching at Stanford have ranged over several fields of engineering and mathematics, with a different focus roughly every decade: information theory, communications, linear systems, estimation and control, signal processing, semiconductor manufacturing, probability and statistics, and matrix and operator theory. 
While he has mentored an outstanding array of over a hundred doctoral and postdoctoral scholars, one the most famous of them, also of Indian origin, is Professor Arogyaswami Paulraj, widely considered the father of WIMAX and the pioneer who made high-speed wireless such as 4G possible. 
In fact, Paulraj credits Kailath’s lectures as a visiting speaker at the Indian Institute of Technology as the inspiration for doing a PhD. It was Kailath was eventually instrumental in bringing Paulraj – then with the Indian Navy – to Stanford University where he became his thesis supervisor. 
In 1992, Kailath and Paulraj together applied for a US patent titled ‘Distributed Transmit – Directional Receive DTDR’ which was granted in 1994, according to India Abroad newspaper. The patent was the building block for increasing bandwidth in wireless systems using multiple antennae for input as well as output. 
Prof. Kailath’s joint efforts with his students have yielded more than 300 journal papers, several of which have received outstanding paper prizes; they have also led to a dozen patents and to several books and monographs, including the major textbooks Linear Systems (1980) and Linear Estimation (2000).
Kailath is also a member of the highly-respected National Academy of Engineering as well as the National Academy of Sciences, both of which are key advisory bodies to the US government.

5 reasons McDonald's is falling apart

Check out Ronald McDonald's new threads!

Another month, another wave of customer defections at your local Mickey D's. McDonald's ( MCD )  posted another disappointing showing in terms of store-level sales for the month of August. U.S. comparable sales slipped 2.8% for the month, falling by an even harder 3.7% worldwide. McDonald's stock hit a new 52-week low on the news.
These are lean times for the world's largest burger flipper, especially closer to home, where comps have fallen in 9 of the past 10 months. Let's explore some of the reasons for the rut that the fast food giant finds itself in at the moment.
1. Quality is a problem
McDonald's has been trying to upgrade the quality of its food, realizing that fast casual chains that offer higher-end fare with the convenience of quick-service restaurants are growing at its expense. Unfortunately, its reputation for having crummy food even within its own category isn't going away.
A Consumer Reports survey of more than 32,000 fast food fans ranked McDonald's dead last among 21 leading burger chains based on taste. When's the last time an entrenched consumer brand dramatically reshaped consumer perception of the quality of its grub? It won't be easy for McDonald's.
2. The growing menu is causing delays and prep mistakes
McDonald's is no longer just about burgers and fries, but giving customers more choices also has its drawbacks. McDonald's hosted a webcast with its franchisees last year, alerting them on growing number of customer complaints about employee unfriendliness.
What's making customers so unhappy? Industry trade mag QSR puts out its Drive-Thru Performance Study every year, tracking transaction speeds. Last year, it found that the average McDonald's customer's wait increased to more than three minutes after placing an order to receive it. That's worse than the industry average, and a personal worst for McDonald's.
Connect the dots, and it's easy to see why the more complicated menu at McDonald's is doing more harm than good.
3. The world is no longer its oyster
It's been a rough go for McDonald's domestically, but it was holding up relatively better overseas until this summer. August has offered a double whammy of international setbacks as a supplier scare has decimated its traffic in China, while Russian regulators shut down several locations on food safety concerns that may ore may not have had political motivations.
In short, the same world that was once there for the taking is starting to turn on McDonald's.
4. McDonald's is being cast as "the bad guy"
It's been a year since the Service Employees International Union launched the Fight for 15 protests, trying to get fast food chains to boost their minimum wage to $15. As the country's largest burger chain, McDonald's has become the poster child for the campaign.
The end result is that a lot of people think it's not just the food that's cheap at McDonald's. It's not entirely fair. As big as McDonald's itself may be, 80% of the restaurants are owned by independent franchisees working on leaner markups. However, those siding with the union's push to roughly double wages at McDonald's may be avoiding the chain on principle, even as most of its burger peers are holding up better in terms of comps.
5. Going back to basics may not be on the table
A common argument is that McDonald's just needs to return to its simple roots and the Dollar Menu emphasis that served it so well in its heyday. The problem is that it isn't likely to work. If McDonald's scrapped the fancy coffee drinks, premium chicken sandwiches, and gourmet burgers off of its menu, do you really think sales would increase? Outside of a likely improvement in speed of service, it would lose more customers than it would gain by going back to basics.
Yes, a place like Five Guys can thrive without adding shakes, desserts, or fancy sandwiches. The challenge is being able to retain popularity once you start to scale back an expanded menu. This is where McDonald's finds itself today, seemingly in a winless situation.

Microsoft demands $6.9 million unpaid interest from SamsungMicrosoft demands $6.9 million unpaid interest from Samsung

San Franscisco, Oct 3:  
Microsoft Corp is demanding $6.9 million interest from Samsung Electronics in a dispute over smartphone patent royalties, according to a lawsuit unsealed by a New York federal court on Friday.
Microsoft is asking the court to rule that it did not breach a business collaboration agreement with Samsung, and that Samsung must pay interest on more than $1 billion in royalty payments which it delayed in protest at Microsoft's planned purchase of rival Nokia's handset business.
A redacted version of the lawsuit was filed by Microsoft in August.
Samsung made royalty payments on time to Microsoft during the first fiscal year after they signed their 2011 agreement, the lawsuit said.
However, after Microsoft announced the Nokia deal in September 2013, Samsung initially refused to make another payment, arguing that the Nokia deal breached its licensing agreement with Microsoft. It eventually paid late without adding interest, according to the lawsuit.
Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Microsoft has successfully argued that Google Inc's Android mobile system uses some of its technology, and as a result most hardware makers, including Samsung, have agreed to pay patent royalties on Android handsets.
Motorola is one of the main holdouts, and that company has been in litigation against Microsoft since 2010.
The lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York is Microsoft Corp vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 14-6039.

Kassig family pleads for release of Islamic State hostageBy Adam Goldman October 4 Follow @adamgoldmanwp

The parents of an American aid worker taken hostage by the Islamic State released a video Saturday pleading with their son’s captors to show mercy and free the young man.
Peter Kassig’s family said he was in the region doing humanitarian work when he disappeared a year ago near the city of Raqqa in eastern Syria.
“We implore those who are holding you to show mercy and use their power to let you go,” Kassig’s mother, Paula said, while holding a picture of their 26-year-old son.
The Islamic State revealed publicly for the first time in a separate video Friday that it was holding Kassig, a former U.S. Army Ranger who served in Iraq in 2007. In the same video, a militant dubbed “Jihadi John,” beheaded an British hostage named Alan Henning , a taxi driver from Manchester. He then threatened to kill Kassig, a Muslim convert, because of U.S. bombing of Islamic State targets in Syria.

Henning was the fourth western hostage the Islamic State has executed in a series of gruesome videos. In three earlier ones, the same militant decapitated American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley as well as British humanitarian aid worker David Haines. The group is holding at least three other westerners, including British journalist John Cantlie and two women, one of whom is an American.
Kassig’s family said the United States’ decision to attack the Islamic State is beyond their control and more violence was a not a solution.
“We asked our government to change its actions, but like our son, we have no more control over the U.S. government than you have over the break of dawn,” Ed Kassig said. “We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go.”
Kassig is a native of Indiana who founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a non-governmental organization to provide aid to Syrians fleeing the civil war in their country.
Beginning in 2012, Kassig delivered food and medical supplies and provided care to civilian casualties inside Syria, the family said.

Karachi: Pakistan's former president and military ruler General (retired) Pervez Musharraf has sought to blame India for ceasefire violations along Line of Control, saying it should stop testing the "patience and resolve" of Pakistani Army.
Musharraf, who is facing a treason case in the Supreme Court, said, "Regular ceasefire violations on the LoC by the Indians is not good for the region and deplorable."
"I think India should stop testing the patience and resolve of the Pakistani Army," he said on Express News.

Relations between the two countries have been tense in recent times due to repeated ceasefire violations along the LoC for which both governments blame each other.
According to India's Border guarding force BSF, firing by Pakistani troops along International Border (IB) in the past two months was possibly the "heaviest" since the 1971 war.
On the anti-government protests led by opposition leader Imran Khan and firebrand cleric Tahirul Qadri, Musharraf said, "The present governance, political and elections system in Pakistan have become redundant."
"I think it is now clear that all political parties have to sit together so that a consensus national government can be formed and fresh elections be held," Musharraf, who heads All Pakistan Muslim League party said.
The former military ruler said "changes are now a foregone conclusion" in Pakistan and the political and electoral system had to be changed for the better future of the country.

SC order to derail Vedanta s plans to raise power capacitySC order to derail Vedanta's plans to raise power capacity
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 04, 2014 10:45 PM IST
Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta group’s plans to become a formidable player in the power sector will suffer a major setback due to unavailability of coal after the Supreme Court judgement recently.
The Supreme Court had cancelled coal blocks allocated to two group companies — Balco and Sterlite Energy — which will impact profitability of the companies.
The group operates power plants in Korba, Chhattisgarh, and Jharsuguda, Odisha. Balco’s 1,200-Mw power plant in Korba has been dormant due to lack of approvals. Now with its coal mine gone, the power project will keep bleeding money, said analysts.

Balco’s 1,200-Mw power plant in Korba has been dormant due to lack of approvals
At Jharsuguda, Sesa Sterlite has two power plants — a 2,400-Mw power plant with independent power producer status and a 1,200-Mw captive power plant to feed the nearby aluminium smelter of 0.5 million tonnes per annum (mpta).
All these power plants were set up with hopes domestic coal can be used. But a shortage of the commodity forced the company to import from as far as South Africa. At Jharsuguda, Vedanta also faces transmission constraints, which have led to lower plant load factor, or output, and electricity shortage. Transmission is expected to improve in the second half of this year as capacities get commissioned, the company Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese had said soon after its June quarter results.
Group insiders said the company will bid for coal blocks after the government comes out with new norms. Till then, it will use coal pooled from domestic and foreign sources to keep the cost of power down.
The company uses its captive unit to run its aluminum plants in Odisha and Chhattisgarh while the power generated at the independent plant is supplied to Odisha and other states.
Vedanta had wanted to become one of the biggest power producers in India. Agarwal had said in an interview the group will bid for power projects to become one of the biggest power producers in the country. But now he is facing a resource problem: His Odisha alumina refinery is also working at low capacity due to lack of local bauxite.
Agarwal had also announced in Bhubaneswar on September 22 that his Lanjigarh alumina refinery would raise production capacity from one million tonne per annum to two million tonnes within a year and gradually ramp it up to six million tonnes. Agarwal had invested Rs 10,000 crore in the Lanjigarh project. Besides, Vedanta has a 1.25-million-tonne smelter with SEZ (special economic zone) status, which is lying idle for the last three years pending resolution of certain issues with the state government over sourcing of power to run the unit.

The (R)evolution of "What and Why" Into "Who"reddit
"The world has entered an era of the most profound and challenging change in human history."                                               - Steven Covey
The ushering in of a new era always requires a redefinition of who we are, where we are, and where we need to be. The evolution from "what" to "why" to "who" represents just such a challenge and is present in everything from the Millennial movement, to customer-based content, to "selfie" inspired social media. To grasp "who's" value let's trace some history.
Four Eras of Evolution
As we transitioned from the Agrarian Era to the Industrial Revolution we focused on the mass production of products, the widgets or "what's by when's." Our competitive strategies were based on streamlining productivity, boosting output and reducing time to market.
As the Industrial Revolution gave way to the Information Era, the "why's and how's" took center stage. The "how's" were about strategic planning, competitive positioning and "working smarter not harder." The "why's" were focused on the values of "work life balance," "customer experience" and even "stewardship."
As the Information Era evolved into the Transformation Era, the importance of "why" and its message of deeper value was artfully leveraged into people development. ("Finding your Why" continues to be a popular and powerful leadership inquiry hosted by experts such as a colleague, Ridgley Goldsborough .) But as we move into the heart of transformation, there is another shift ahead which I call the "(R)evolution of Who." To understand this new-comer let's explore its three evolutions and revolutions:
The (R)evolution of Who Trio
"What's" are the contents of what we have, (our possessions, assets and belongings.)
"Why's" are the values behind what we do, (making a difference, contributing, giving.)
"Who" is our generative state of being, (the inner wellspring from which all our values arise.)
The transformation of self arising within this trio is cumulative not exclusive. In other words, Who we are is the "first cause" or interconnected source point of the three. (This is because we create out of Who we are, not out of Why we are, or What we are.) From first cause, our Why resolves into value, thus providing us meaning, direction and purpose. Finally, our What's crystallize into tangible steps and results.  To bring this (R)evolution of Who to life, allow me to recount a "summit inspired" experience for you.
To The Summit of Our Greatness
. . . At twelve thousand feet our team had just traversed a huge fissure in the ice. Climbing to the center of the open slope above it all seemed well until the crampon on my left boot popped loose. I grabbed for my ice axe to brake, but I landed hard and it bounced from my hands. Terror raged through my body as I careened out of control!
Suddenly I smashed into something hard. Blinded by snow I lay helpless. Then it hit me; my fellow climbers just saved my life by forming a human net, catching me just a few meters before falling to my death.
"We've got ya! We're not gonna let you fall!"
"Thanks everybody, I can take it from here."
"Lay still Val Jon, you're pushing us back into the crevasse!"
"No, really, I'm okay now. I'll be fine now."
"Stop wiggling around or you're going to kill us all!"
That got in. I finally let go and as they helped me to my feet, I realized my "What" of rugged independence made it nearly impossible for people to support me. Tears filled my eyes as I recounted my past. I would always say, "No problem, I can do it myself." I didn't want to burden anyone or put them out. Looking into these climber's faces I saw images of family members, friends and past relationships I had alienated with my closed attitude.
In that moment I became aware of my "Why." The value of opening to others was so much greater than the What called "I can do it myself."  As I embraced my Why, for the first time in my life I realized that accepting help was not an act of weakness, it was an act of humility.
Where I accessed my Who however was at the summit.  Atop all great mountains is a register book and as I flipped through Shasta's I came upon a passage written years before my climb. I'll never forget it:
Father, I dedicate this climb to you. I am standing at the top of Mount Shasta today because of the love and support you gave me as I was growing up. It was your commitment to me that gave me the strength to do this climb. And although you lost your legs in the Korean War and have never been able to stand beside me, Dad, I want you to know that today I stand on the top of this mountain for both of us. I love you with all my heart, your son John.
Peering out over the curve of the Earth the power of this young man's Who evoked my own Who. It arose within me like a summit through the clouds of mediocrity.
I vowed from that moment on that I would remain true to Who I am, fully embrace my Why's and commit to only those What's that support living true to my greater self and assist others with the same.
If my story touched who You are, then the (R)evolution of Who is alive and well. Together let's embrace Who we are fully, infuse it into our Why's and make it real in our What's.
If not us . . . then Who?

Playing catch up with FB  Yahoo may invest i...Playing catch up with Facebook and Google, Yahoo may invest in Snapchat

(Yahoo recently acquired…)
By Michael J De La Merced and Mike Isaac
Yahoo, flush with cash from selling a portion of its stake in the Alibaba Group of China, appears ready to bet on what it believes will be the next big Internet phenomenon.
The company has held talks to invest in Snapchat, the extremely popular app that allows photos and messages to self-destruct, people briefed on the matter said Friday. The deal has not yet closed, some of these people added.
Should Yahoo make the investment, it will join a bevy of other prominent investors, including the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, that have valued the disappearing-photo service at about $10 billion.
While Yahoo is not expected to invest a huge amount of money in Snapchat, the investment could give it access to the messaging phenomenon and help Yahoo become more relevant to young consumer audiences once more. It would also give the company a more strategic stake in mobile technology, an area in which Yahoo has long been seen as a laggard compared with competitors like Facebook and Google.
Yahoo has been bolstered by a roughly $6 billion haul from selling a significant portion of its holdings in Alibaba, the fast-growing Chinese shopping behemoth that went public last month. At least half of the proceeds from the sale will go toward buying back stock, but some of the money could go toward strategic acquisitions and investments.
Talks between Yahoo and Snapchat gained steam late this summer, some of the people briefed on the matter said.
  In that vein, Yahoo recently acquired MessageMe, a small photo and text messaging startup in San Francisco, according to a person close to the company. It is yet another in a string of small mobile startup acquisitions for Yahoo, which began soon after Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, took the top position in 2012.
Yet that strategy could expose Yahoo to criticism from shareholders leery that the Alibaba windfall will lead to another spending spree. The activist hedge fund Starboard Value emerged as an investor in the company last week and pointedly demanded that Yahoo not pursue takeovers of debatable value like the $1.1 billion acquisition of the blogging site Tumblr.
Though Snapchat has garnered millions of regular users who send hundreds of millions of photos and videos every day, it has yet to generate any revenue.
The young company is celebrated in Silicon Valley circles, particularly for its popularity among the much-coveted millennial demographic. Snapchat, which is based in Venice, California, has raised upward of $160 million in venture capital; last fall, the company spurned a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook.
Snapchat has been experimenting with ways to distribute content on its popular network. It has worked with musicians, large brands and popular users on its network to figure out different ways to distribute "snaps" - the company's name for its disappearing messages - that will keep its member base coming back regularly.
This could be where the two companies see eye to eye. Mayer has repeatedly said that Yahoo is a "digital content company at its core" and has worked to bolster its content offerings. The company has commissioned two television-length comedy series that will air exclusively on Yahoo's mobile apps and website. Last fall, Mayer hired Katie Couric, the seasoned journalist who has been the anchor of news programs for NBC, CBS and ABC, to be Yahoo's global news anchor.
Couric recently attended a small private party thrown by Snapchat's founders during Advertising Week, an annual media industry event held in New York, according to a person familiar with the guest list.
Representatives for Yahoo and Snapchat declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on the fundraising talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

What Texas can learn from Nigeria when it comes to containing EbolaBy Elahe Izadi October 4 Follow @ElaheIzadi

While devastating reports continue to stream out of West Africa, where the deadly virus has overwhelmed already weak public health systems and left thousands of people dead , and anxiety grips the United States over the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the country, one nation serves as an example of hope: Nigeria, which appears to have successfully contained Ebola .
As concerns spread over U.S. hospital readiness , there are some lessons to be learned from Nigeria, where officials managed to get ahead of the fast-moving virus after it was brought into Africa's most populous country by an Ebola-infected man who'd flown into Lagos. This week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the outbreak could be coming to an end in Nigeria, with no new Ebola cases since Aug. 31.
As in the U.S. case, Ebola arrived in Nigeria by passenger plane. But unlike Thomas Eric Duncan — who arrived in Dallas before he became symptomatic and was therefore not contagious during his flights from Liberia to Texas through Brussels and Dulles International Airport — Patrick Sawyer was already symptomatic when he landed in Lagos on July 20 . At that point, Sawyer, Nigeria's Patient Zero, was contagious and dying.
It was a nightmare scenario with the potential to spiral out of control, given the bustling city of Lagos, Africa's largest, is a major transportation hub. As Sawyer was placed in isolation, public health officials had to track down every single person who'd come into contact with him, from the flights he'd boarded to the Lagos airport and the private hospital where he went after landing. And they had to do so quickly, making the process known as contact tracing a priority.
"In the whole system approach in beating the war on Ebola, contact tracing is the key public health activity that needs to be done," said Gavin MacGregor-Skinner, who helped with the Ebola response in Nigeria with the  Elizabeth R. Griffin Research Foundation . "The key is to find all the people that patient had direct close contact with."
From that single patient came a list of 281 people, MacGregor-Skinner said. Every one of those individuals had to provide health authorities twice-a-day updates about their well-being, often through methods like text-messaging. Anyone who didn't feel well or failed to respond was checked on, either through a neighborhood network or health workers.
Nigeria took a "whole community approach," with everyone from military officials to church elders in the same room, discussing how to handle the response to the virus, MacGregor-Skinner said.
Such an approach, and contact tracing in general, requires people be open and forthright about their movements and their health, he said. Stigmatization of patients, their families and contacts could only discourage that, so Nigerian officials sent a message to "really make them look like heroes," MacGregor-Skinner said.
"This is the best thing people can do for Nigeria: They are going to protect and save Nigeria by being honest, by doing what they need to do, by reporting to the health commission," he said. This made people feel like they were a part of something extremely important, he said, and also took into account real community needs. "You got real engagement and compliance from the contacts. They're not running and hiding."
Sawyer had come into contact with someone who ended up in Port Harcourt. That person, a regional official, went to a doctor who ended up dying from Ebola in August. Within a week, 70 people were being monitored. It ballooned to an additional 400 people in that one city.
Success stories of people coming through strict Ebola surveillance alive and healthy helped encourage more people to come forward , as they recognized that ending up in a contact tracer's sights didn't mean a death sentence.
In the end, contact tracers — trained professionals and volunteers — conducted 18,500 face-to-face visits to assess potential symptoms, according to the CDC, and the list of contacts throughout the country grew to 894. Two months later, Nigeria ended up with a total of 20 confirmed or probable cases and eight deaths.
The CDC also pointed to the robust public health response by Nigerian officials, who have had experience with massive public health crises in the past — namely polio in 2012 and large-scale lead poisoning in 2010.
When someone is on a contact list, that doesn't mean that person has to stay at home for the entire incubation period of 21 days from the last contact with someone who had Ebola. People on contact lists are not under quarantine or in isolation. They can still go to work and go on with their their lives. But they should take their temperature twice a day for 21 days and check in with health workers.
Officials in Texas began with a list of about 100 names ; they have whittled the list down to 50 people who had some contact with Duncan. Of those, 10 are considered high-risk .
The CDC recommends that people without symptoms but who have had direct contact with the bodily fluids of a person sick with Ebola be put under either conditional release, meaning that they self-monitor their health and temperature and check in daily, or controlled movement. People under controlled movement have to notify officials about any intended travel and shouldn't use commercial planes or trains. Local public transportation use is approved on a case-by-case basis.
When symptoms do develop, that's when the response kicks into high gear. People with Ebola are contagious only once they begin exhibiting symptoms, which include fever, severe headaches and vomiting.
While four people in Dallas are under government-ordered quarantine, that is not the norm. Those individuals "were non-compliant with the request to stay home. I don’t want to go too far beyond that," Dallas County Judge Clay Lewis Jenkins  said Thursday .
On Friday, the four people were moved to a private residence from the apartment where Duncan had been staying when he became symptomatic.
A law enforcement officer will remain with them to enforce the order, and none of the people are allowed to leave until Oct. 19.
Duncan is the only person with an Ebola diagnosis in Dallas, and no one else is showing symptoms at the moment. But, as Nigeria knows, the work in Dallas has just begun .

Japanese zoo gives up attempt to mate hyena  couple  after realising both are maleJapanese zoo gives up attempt to mate hyena 'couple' after realising both are male

File photo of a hyena (AFP Photo)
Zookeepers in Japan have abandoned an attempt to have two spotted hyenas mate and reproduce as both turned out to be male.
The Maruyama Zoo in Sapporo, northern Japan, said in a statement this week that it was gifted the animals as a "male and female couple" in October 2010 from a zoo in the South Korean twin city of Daejon.
"We have attempted to house them together for breeding many times but they often fought against each other and never engaged themselves in breeding behaviour," the statement said.
Kami, the supposedly female hyena now five years old, has shown no estrus symptoms after reaching sexual maturity, prompting the zoo to put it and its six-year-old partner Kamutori to sex tests.
"We have determined that the two animals are both male after conducting ultrasound imaging and hormone tests on them under anaesthesia," the statement said.
The zoo explained that it is "extremely difficult" to determine the sex of a spotted hyena from the appearance of its external genitalia.
"We still plan to obtain a female spotted hyena for breeding with either Kami or Kamutori," the statement said.

Siemens may close energy plants amid low mar...Siemens may close some energy plants amid low margins
By Reuters | 4 Oct, 2014, 06.38PM IST
Siemens expects low profit margins at its energy division in the next couple of years and could close some factories as a result.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
FRANKFURT: German industrial conglomerate Siemens expects low profit margins at its energy division in the next couple of years and could close some factories as a result, the head of the division told the Boersen-Zeitung newspaper.
Lisa Davis said the company was reviewing individual sites and it was unclear whether some would be closed or whether they would be used for different products.
"We will see low margins (in the Power and Gas unit) in the next two to three years," she was quoted as saying.
The newly-created Siemens Power and Gas division makes products ranging from gas turbines and compressors to oilfield equipment. Siemens strengthened it this year with the acquisitions of US-based Dresser Rand as well as Rolls Royce's power unit.
The takeovers will help Siemens adjust to a change in energy markets, where small, decentralised units are on the rise to the detriment of large power plants, Davis told the paper.
"By 2030 about a third of our electricity will come from local systems," she was quoted as saying.
When announcing the Dresser Rand deal last month, Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said he expected demand for products such as gas turbines to rebound from 2016, adding the synergies from the deal justified the purchase price.
Siemens expects more than 150 million euros in annual synergies by 2019 from the Dresser Rand transaction, which complements its business in turbo compressors, downstream and industrial applications as well as larger steam turbines.
Davis indicated the group may not have to wait that long.
"We have calculated the synergies rather conservatively. It is well possible that we will see positive surprises," she told the paper.

Modi: not just Hi-Fi and Wi-Fi but also safaiModi: not just Hi-Fi and Wi-Fi but also safai
BS Reporter | New Delhi Oct 04, 2014 10:35 PM IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched his campaign for the upcoming Assembly elections. He exhorted voters in Haryana and Maharashtra to kick out governments run by land grabbers. He charged the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) government in Maharashtra of having cleaned out the state treasury and accused the Haryana government of being ‘anti-farmer’ and which protected goons.
In both Haryana and Maharashtra, Modi took forward his ‘Swachh Bharat’ or ‘Clean India’ campaign. He said the time has come to remove not just political dirt but keep our surroundings clean. “People say it is the era of
Hi-Fi (technology) and Wi-Fi (connectivity) but I say safai (cleanliness) is also important,” said Modi, asking all those who had attended the rally not to leave behind any plastic bottles or wastes.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is going alone in Haryana. Its ally Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress parted ways with the BJP in early September. In Maharashtra, the BJP and Shiv Sena ended their 25-year alliance. The BJP is contesting 256 of the state’s 288 seats, having left the rest for its smaller allies. Both states will witness a four-cornered fight. Haryana and Maharashtra will go to polls on October 15.
Modi didn’t attack erstwhile or potential allies in these states directly. “Would you rather go to Chandigarh to find a solution to your problem or the Tihar jail (in Delhi),” Modi said in Karnal. Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) chief Om Prakash Chautala is currently out on bail on health grounds in a corruption case, but has said he would take oath of CM from the Tihar jail. The BJP, in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, had prominently raised the issue of alleged illegal land deals that the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government in Haryana facilitated for Robert Vadra.
Modi said the Hooda government was the “enemy of villages”. In his public rallies, Hooda has claimed that Haryana tops in the per capita income in India.
In Maharashtra, Modi accused the NCP-Congress combine of having presided over the state’s industrial decline. He claimed Maharashtra was 12th in its literacy rate in India, sixth in its efforts to reduce unemployment and 15th in its development rate. The PM stressed how Gujarat was always Maharashtra’s younger sibling; having been carved out of that state but has done economically much better in recent years.
In Karnal, Modi said he wanted to see Haryana where he learnt his political ropes to prosper. “The truth is that the Congress government has imposed four per cent tax on mandis (wholesale markets), with the result that Basmati from Haryana has become non-competitive,” he said.
In Beed, which is also going to witness a Lok Sabha byelection because of Gopinath Munde’s death, Modi said Shivaji didn’t have big generals but emboldened his people to achieve greater deeds. “People ask me about my big vision. But I am a common man, who thinks for the welfare of the common people,” Modi said.
The PM spoke about the need to stop farmer suicides in Maharashtra, the potential of Aurangabad as a tourism destination and his resolve to end corruption. He also talked about decline in diesel and petrol prices and highlighted the fact that 50 million people have opened bank accounts and deposited Rs 3,000 crore through Jan Dhan Yojana.
“Did India’s name resound in the US as it did this time? Why did it happen,” Modi asked the crowd in Beed and Aurangabad.  “It wasn’t Modi’s magic or charisma. It was because of the 125 crore people of India who have stood behind me and given a government of full majority,” Modi said.
Meanwhile. Congress President Sonia Gandhi at her rally in Meham in Haryana said the PM was trying to “show off”. Gandhi said: “They are creating such an atmosphere as if nothing has happened in the country since Independence and they will change everyone's fortunes overnight. Has any step been taken to fulfil promises made during the Lok Sabha elections? Has inflation come down? Is the poor man getting food at a cheaper rate? Have the unemployed got jobs? What happened to their promise of getting back the black money from abroad within 100 days of coming to power? Have any steps been taken in this regard? Absolutely not,” she said. The Congress president said empty vessels make the most noise.

Durga Puja festival comes to an end in West Bengal

Kolkata: Bengal's four-day-long extravaganza, the Durga Puja festival, came to an end on Saturday with immersion of the idols of Goddess Durga and her progeny as people celebrated Vijaya Dasami.
The immersion of idols in the city at the ghats of the Hooghly was made amidst tight security, police said.
The immersion marks the symbolic return of the Goddess and her children to Mount Kailash, the heavenly abode of her husband Lord Shiva, after her annual sojourn on earth.
The immersion of idols in the city at the ghats of the Hooghly was made amidst tight security, police said.
"Around 1700 to 1800 idols will be immersed today. The immersion is overseen by speed boats, watch towers and police personnel in strength," police said.
Besides the community pujas, many household pujas were also scheduled for immersion today.
However, there would be no immersion tomorrow because of Bakri-Id and it would resume after 8 PM on October 6, police said.
"According to a government notification there will be no immersion on Sunday because of Bakri-Id. It will resume at 8pm on Monday (October 6) which is the last date for immersion," they said.
Several big budget puja committees have decided to keep their idols for a day to give puja enthusiasts a last chance to have a look at the gorgeous pandals and extravagant lighting.
In districts towns and in the city, thousands of people bade a tearful farewell to the Goddess. Young revellers, middle-aged puja committee members and women in finery danced down the streets escorting the idols to the immersion ghats as drums rolled and bagpipes played full throttle, police said.
Bystanders lined the streets of the metropolis along the procession routes cheering the processionists who chanted "Durga Maiki Jai".
Before the immersion ceremony, married women in white and red-bordered saris engaged in 'sindoor khela' (smearing of vermillion on each other's forehead). Men and children exchanged greetings and the state fondly bid adieu to the Goddess imploring with her to visist again next year --
"Aschche Bochhor Abar Esho, Ma."

Parents of former Army Ranger plead Islamic State to free their hostageBy Adam Goldman October 4 Follow @adamgoldmanwp

The parents of an American aid worker taken hostage by the Islamic State released a video Saturday pleading with their son’s captors to show mercy and free the young man.
Peter Kassig’s family said he was in the region doing humanitarian work when he disappeared a year ago near the city of Raqqa in eastern Syria.
“We implore those who are holding you to show mercy and use their power to let you go,” Kassig’s mother, Paula said, while holding a picture of their 26-year-old son.
The Islamic State revealed publicly for the first time in a separate video Friday that it was holding Kassig, a former U.S. Army Ranger who served in Iraq in 2007. In the same video, a militant dubbed “Jihadi John,” beheaded an British hostage named Alan Henning , a taxi driver from Manchester. He then threatened to kill Kassig, a Muslim convert, because of U.S. bombing of Islamic State targets in Syria.

Henning was the fourth western hostage the Islamic State has executed in a series of gruesome videos. In three earlier ones, the same militant decapitated American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley as well as British humanitarian aid worker David Haines. The group is holding at least three other westerners, including British journalist John Cantlie and two women, one of whom is an American.
Kassig’s family said the United States’ decision to attack the Islamic State is beyond their control and more violence was a not a solution.
“We asked our government to change its actions, but like our son, we have no more control over the U.S. government than you have over the break of dawn,” Ed Kassig said. “We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go.”
Kassig is a native of Indiana who founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a non-governmental organization to provide aid to Syrians fleeing the civil war in their country.
Beginning in 2012, Kassig delivered food and medical supplies and provided care to civilian casualties inside Syria, the family said.
