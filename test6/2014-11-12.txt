Unit owner is liable for water damage to his unit0
Q. I sit on a town house community association board. I am aware that for condominium associations, unit owners are entitled to attend board meetings but do not have the right to speak during the board meeting. Does the same rule apply for community associations?
A. Pursuant to Section 1-40 of the Common Interest Community Association Act (CICAA), owners in a community association are also entitled to attend the open portion of board meetings to observe the meeting but may not disrupt or speak while the board is conducting business.
However, unlike the requirements in the Condominium Act, Section 1-40 of CICAA requires that community association boards reserve a portion of the board meeting for comments by owners. The duration of the owner comment session, and when it occurs during the board meeting, is within the sole discretion of the board.
Q. Lenders for condominium unit purchasers commonly ask the association to provide them the percentage of the units that are owner/rental occupied. Should the answer to that question be based on the addition of all the rented units' percentage in the common elements or the number of units leased divided by the total number of units?
A. Lender questionnaires for contract purchasers of condominium units request the percentage of unit owner/rental occupancy as a part of the lender's risk assessment for the loan. The proper method to calculate such percentage for that purpose is to divide the number of leased units by the total number of units.

New IT Jobs Set to Fall by 50% in Four Years: CrisilGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New hirings in the IT sector are likely to drop by 50 per cent over the next four years, according to a report by Crisil. The prediction is extremely negative for lakhs of engineering students across the country as the IT sector has traditionally been the biggest employer in the private sector.
(Also read: Why 2014 could be another bad year for IT graduates )
More than 7 lakh engineering students graduate every year. In fiscal 2013-14, Crisil estimates IT hiring at 1.05 lakh and says the number could come down to a mere 55,000 by 2017-18. The IT sector currently employs 31 lakh people or 24 per cent of total private sector jobs in the organised sector. The sharp slowdown will therefore impact the overall hiring sentiment in the economy.
IT jobs growth is slowing down because margins in the $118 billion outsourcing industry are under pressure. Frontline IT companies such as TCS, Infosys and Wipro earn nearly three fourth revenues from North America and Europe, where growth is still anemic. As a result, clients are asking companies to cut costs. (Read: What Infosys Results Signal for IT Graduates, Campus Hiring )
Since employee salaries account for the biggest cost component for IT companies, domestic outsourcers are reducing bench strength, improving employee utilisation rates and reducing other operational costs, Crisil says. In 2013-14, employee cost accounted for over 60 per cent of total cost of IT companies.
"Companies will run very tight ships because of which incremental employment will be curbed," Crisil says.
The report says Indian companies are increasingly looking to maintain a leaner bench by adopting just-in-time hiring to improve utilisation rates. The current utilisation (or productivity) rate stands at 80 per cent and Crisil expects it to go up by 500 basis points in the medium term. A 100-basis-point improvement in utilisation impacts the employee growth by 105 basis points, the report says.
Companies are gradually migrating towards fixed price contracts, which eliminate the need for maintaining a large workforce for billing purposes. Such contracts weigh on hiring as revenue per employee goes up, Crisil notes.
Finally, Indian companies are planning strategies to move further up the value chain towards services such as consulting and software products, Crisil says. These services are currently dominated by global majors (such as Accenture, IBM), who have higher revenue per employee despite comparable employee bases.

The only 5 things you should have in your walletHere Are The Only Things You Should Have In Your Wallet
By Sarah Schmalbruch | Business Insider –  Thu 23 Oct, 2014 7:34 PM IST
Flickr / Leeber Time to do some work on your wallet.
Your wallet should be an organizational tool, not a catch-all. 
If yours is bulging with month-old receipts, random gift cards, and every single credit card you own , it may be time for a little process of elimination.
Recently, the Today Show aired a segment  that focused on the items you should carry in your wallet as part of their Take Charge Of Your Life series.
Here's what they designated necessary to keep close, plus a few extra items you might want to have on hand.
1. The main forms of ID you use
The Today Show says your driver's license or photo ID should always have a place in your wallet in case of an emergency or any situation where someone needs to verify your identity.
It's a good idea to carry your health insurance card as well, for doctors' appointments or in case of an emergency.
Keep your social security card at home or in a safe deposit box at a bank — there's a greater chance of someone stealing it if you carry it on you.
2. Debit, credit, and loyalty cards
There's no need for more than one debit card in your wallet, explains the Today Show, and you should try to limit yourself to two credit cards in case your wallet is lost or stolen . Identifying the one or two credit cards that give you the most rewards will encourage you to use those more often, benefitting you in the long term.
Retail credit cards, however, are better off left at home unless you're planning on hitting that store specifically, since they have a higher interest rate than most other credit cards.
If there's a store loyalty card (not a credit card) you use frequently — like one from your grocery store — you might want to carry that, too. If not, most stores will allow you to give your phone number instead.
>
Sarah Schmalbruch / Business Insider Take a look at the perfectly streamlined wallet, numbered according to category. 3. Some cash
The Today Show also says that it's always a good idea to have a little cash in your wallet, for a tip , for an emergency, or for the odd cash-only purchase. If you're ever caught in a cash-only situation without any cash, you might end up paying $2.50 or $3.00 to use an out of network ATM .
4. Your work ID 
If you use an ID or a badge to get into the building where you work, it makes sense to keep that in your wallet, since you use it regularly.
5. A transportation card
Anyone who has ever missed the subway fishing around for their MetroCard or CharlieCard might want to move it from the bottom of their purse or briefcase to their wallet. If you take public transportation to and from work, you'll want to have your card handy. 

Moody s expects robust growth in India over the next 2 yearsMoody's expects robust growth in India over the next 2 years
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 11, 2014 08:24 IST
Global GDP growth is unlikely to rebound significantly in the next two years, as a gradual slowdown in the Chinese economy and structural impediments to growth in the euro area, Brazil and South Africa continue to weigh on economic activity, says Moody's Investors Service.
 
 
Global GDP growth is unlikely to rebound significantly in the next two years, as a gradual slowdown in the Chinese economy and structural impediments to growth in the euro area, Brazil and South Africa continue to weigh on economic activity, says Moody's Investors Service in its quarterly Global Macro Outlook report. For the G20 economies as a whole, the rating agency expects GDP growth of around 3% in 2015 and 2016, after 2.8% in 2014.
"Most factors that have weighed on global GDP growth in 2014 will remain in place in the next two years, including the gradual slowdown in China," says Marie Diron, a Moody's Senior Vice President and author of the report. The latter has led to a very sharp deceleration in its imports and has dampened export growth globally. "Moreover, structural deficiencies in some countries and regions - including the euro area, Brazil and South Africa - are also preventing a significant rebound in growth," continues Ms Diron.
These domestic factors are impinging on economic activity to a greater extent than previously envisaged and have driven a downward revision in Moody's 2015 forecasts for many countries and regions, including the euro area, Japan and Brazil. In contrast, Moody's expects sustained robust growth in the US, UK and India over the next two years.
Moody's does not expect any significant rebound in European economic growth in the near term as the recent weakness in economic data highlights deep-seated issues. The rating agency now forecasts European GDP to rise by less than 1% and by 1.3% in 2015 and 2016 respectively, after 0.7% in 2014. By 2019, Moody's expects the euro area economy to be 17% or EUR1.7 trillion smaller than it would have been had pre-crisis growth trends been maintained.
Generally, slow progress on economic reforms, continuing high levels of corporate debt relative to GDP in certain countries such as France and Spain and uncertainty about geopolitical developments in Ukraine and growth prospects in China will continue to weigh on fixed asset investment in the euro area.
In this environment, corporates will also postpone recruitment plans and/or continue to make redundancies. In the near term, Moody's expects further increases in unemployment in weaker euro area countries, which will dampen consumer spending and prolong the very low growth environment. In turn, muted demand from these two major markets will have a negative impact on exports and thereby investment in Germany, despite low levels of corporate debt, high profits and record-low unemployment in the country. Weak demand from the rest of the euro area will also dampen economic recovery in the other peripheral countries, where GDP growth has, thus far, been mainly export driven.
Moody's forecasts no rebound in growth in Russia in 2015. Instead, the rating agency expects it will record a shallow recession, followed by economic stagnation in 2016. The conflict and associated sanctions have exacerbated a downward trend in GDP growth, the result of years of under-investment in non-energy sectors and diminishing efficiency and increasing costs of oil and gas extraction.
In contrast, Moody's forecasts UK GDP growth of around 2.5% in 2015 and 2016, with a number of factors sustaining growth at robust rates. Non-residential investment has increased sharply in the year to Q3 2014, and will continue to be supported by high cash balances which are being put to use as business sentiment about the economic outlook remains positive. In addition, the economic outlook will be consistent with ongoing falls in unemployment even if a return to productivity growth more in line with historical averages will slow employment growth.

Reliance s Entry in Telecom: Top telcos  credit profiles intact  says FitchReliance's Entry in Telecom: Top telcos' credit profiles intact, says Fitch
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 11, 2014 09:40 IST
The outlook for profitable private telcos could turn negative should price-based competition return in the voice segment, which would narrow profitability.
 
 
The credit profiles of the top four Indian telcos - Bharti Airtel Limited (Bharti; BBB-/Stable), Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications - will remain intact in 2015 thanks to a gradual rise in voice tariffs and improving regulatory environment that stem from industry consolidation, Fitch Ratings says in a new special report.
The likely entry of new telco Reliance Jio, which is part of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL; BBB-/Stable) in 1H15 will intensify competition in the data segment, and may cause data tariffs to decline by at least 20%. Jio will focus largely on data and may have a limited impact on the incumbents' core voice business, given a weak "voice-over-LTE" technology ecosystem and lack of affordable 4G-compatible handsets in India. We do not foresee a re-run of the tariff wars of 2009-2013, which led to a severe decline in industry tariffs.
The outlook for nationally owned telcos and weaker unprofitable telcos is negative due to their unviable business models, high cost structure, weak spectrum assets and large capex requirements. Weaker, unprofitable operators will seek mergers amid EBITDA losses, lack of 3G/4G spectrum assets, and likely relaxation of M&A restrictions. Six operators are likely to emerge from the industry shake-out, as 10 12 operators are unsustainable. Fitch expects the top four telcos to increase their revenue market share to around 83% (2014: 79%) of the USD30bn industry.
Industry revenue will grow by at a mid-single-digit rate in 2015, driven by data services. The top four telcos' 2015 average operating EBITDA margin will be mostly unchanged at 32%-33% (2014: 32%) as a decline in data tariffs will offset a gradual rise in voice tariffs. The top four telcos will generate a minimal free cash flow (FCF) margin due to higher capex and flat EBITDA; the 2015 industry capex/revenue ratio could rise as fast-growing data traffic requires supporting investment.
Fitch expects Bharti's 2015 funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted net leverage to improve to 2.2x-2.3x (FY14: 2.5x, excluding unpaid spectrum costs), thanks to an equity issue of USD350m by its tower subsidiary Bharti Infratel and its ability to generate USD600m-700m in annual FCF. Leverage could also improve due to Bharti's plan to monetise its African towers during 2015-2016, which could help raise around USD2bn. Bharti's operating EBITDAR margin will remain stable at around 32%-33% (2014: 32%) as the Indian competitive landscape continues to improve and Bharti gains market share in its African operations.
The outlook for profitable private telcos could turn negative should price-based competition return in the voice segment, which would narrow profitability. The sector outlook could turn negative if the Indian government auctions a smaller-than-expected quantity of telecom spectrum in 2015, which could lead to aggressive bidding by incumbents whose licences expire during 2015-2016.

RBI issues revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCsRBI issues Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 11, 2014 08:20 IST
Explaining the rationale behind the revised framework, the Reserve Bank stated, "a lighter regulatory framework has been placed on NBFCs other than for those with large asset sizes and deposit accepting.
 
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today issued the revised Regulatory Framework for Non-banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), with a view to streamlining the regulations for the sector. It also revoked, with immediate effect, its temporary suspension on issuance of Certificate of Registration (CoR) to companies proposing to conduct business of non-banking financial institution (NBFI). (The Reserve Bank had temporarily suspended issuance of Certificate of Registration on April 1, 2014 pending revision in the framework for NBFCs.)
Explaining the rationale behind the revised framework, the Reserve Bank stated, "a lighter regulatory framework has been placed on NBFCs other than for those with large asset sizes and deposit accepting. For NBFCs with large asset sizes, and for all deposit accepting NBFCs, regulations have been harmonised across NBFCs, and to some extent, with banks. The intent is to create a level playing field that does not unduly favour or disfavour any institution." It further stated that in limited areas where harmonisation has resulted in strengthening the regulations, generally adequate time has been given to manage the transition. The regulator will then focus on the most important and systemic risks.

Swanky IGI T3 fails security testSafety scare for Delhi Airport
Mail Today –  Tue 11 Nov, 2014
Print
NEW DELHI: Tall claims about state-of-the-art security apparatus at the Indira Gandhi International Airport appear to have fallen flat as an audit by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has found that one of the busiest airports in Asia has as many as 300 chinks in its security that could make it vulnerable to terrorist attacks.
“These grey areas are now becoming hotspots for illegal activities as thieves, human traffickers and officials involved in illegal activities are committing crimes there. Areas like customs, immigration, check-in, security check areas and boarding areas are among the grey spots that have no CCTV coverage,” a senior official of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security told Mail Today.
The security audit of Terminal 3 (T3), touted as a “hyper sensitive” airport, has nailed more grey areas, including more than 12 poorly-lit spots where CCTV cameras cannot capture images of any suspicious movement or activity.
Experts have contended that these lapses make the airport as insecure as a common market. According to the experts, the dozen dark spots are like open invitations for intruders.
The issue of poorly-lit areas is not new and has been raised in the past by the CISF.
The report also pointed out that the poor performance of T3’s sole anti-intruder device is a major security threat.
Threats
“During technical audit, which is also a part of security audit, it was noticed that the antiintruder device is not working properly. The CISF raised a strong objection on this issue,” an official told Mail Today on condition of anonymity.
This year alone, some nine intrusions have been detected by authorities. The anti-intruder device or perimeter intrusion detection system (PIDS) has even become a major reason for a tussle between the CISF, the main agency for guarding the airport, and DIAL, the operator of the airport.
The report also expressed concern at the deployment of private security guard at vital points.
“The multi-level car parking and cargo terminal are areas which are handled by private security personnel. Apart from the security audit, the issue was discussed in a recent meeting and it was suggested that these areas should be handed to CISF personnel as they are trained to deal with terrorist activities,” a CISF official said.
The report stressed the need to deploy additional CISF personnel but no action has been taken so far, a senior airport official said.
Even after several written communications, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has been sitting on the report, officials claimed.
When the Intelligence Bureau recently issued a general alert about terror attacks at several airports, including the one in Delhi, the spy agency expressed concern over these grey areas.
Recently, a Punjab-based traveller coming from Dubai lost his valuable items at T3. He immediately informed CISF officials about the theft and when officials check the CCTV footage, they found that the spot where he was mugged was a grey area with no CCTV coverage.
Another concern Later, he filed a complaint with Delhi Police and a case was registered.
Similarly, during an investigation of human trafficking, the Delhi Police asked airport officials to hand over CCTV footage.
But it was found that the spot where immigration officials were allegedly facilitating the traffickers was out of CCTV reach, a Delhi Police official said.
Another major concern is the baggage handling area, officials said.
This is one of the most crime-prone areas and 90 per cent of thefts reported at IGI airport have occurred in this area.

Ebay India Chief Meets Commerce Minister
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 11, 2014 22:55 (IST)
New Delhi: Ebay India managing director Latif Nathani met Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday to discuss the prospects of the $3 billion burgeoning e-commerce industry in the country.
Mr Nathani said eBay has 50,000 sellers on its platform, of which, 15,000 sell across the globe.
"That is a huge opportunity with the government charter of 'Make in India' because these 15,000 sellers are mostly artisans, craftsman and they are exporting India's products and India's culture abroad," he told reporters after the meeting.
"This is closely aligned with the government's plan of 'Make in India' and I think the Minister was very receptive to what we are doing and appreciative of that," he added.
It was an "introductory, courtesy meeting" with the minister, Mr Nathani said, adding that Ebay has been in India for nine years.
"We are the largest market place in India, so wanted to talk with her about our history in India and about prospects of e-commerce," he said.
Asked whether the issue of allowing FDI in online retail came up for discussion, he replied in the negative.
"We do not talk about that because eBay doesn't get affected with the FDI policy," he said.
Besides the growing base of sellers, the global marketplace major is also betting big on mobile technology to propel its growth in the country.
"We are looking at significant expansion. We are very bullish on mobile commerce. For example, we have come out with new products on mobile web and mobile app. Mobile is a big area for us," he said.
A report by consulting firm Technopak estimates the $2.3 billion e-tailing market to reach $32 billion by 2020, driven by increasing internet penetration. Other reports peg the current market to be closer to $3 billion.
The Indian e-commerce sector has been growing at a very fast pace with players like Snapdeal and Flipkart raising well over $4 billion from a range of investors including angel and private equity firms.
Ebay itself is an investor in Snapdeal. The homegrown firm also follows the marketplace model and claims to have 50,000-plus merchants onboard.

Sensex up 87 points in early tradeSensex jumps 99 points to 28,009 on sustained capital inflows
Our Bureau/Agencies

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by nearly 99 points at 28,008.90 on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors despite weak global cues.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty ended higher by 20.65 points at 8,383.30.
Among BSE sectoral indices, auto and banking indices were the star-performers and were up 1.18 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.37 per cent, followed by metal 0.9 per cent, PSU 0.57 per cent and capital goods 0.53 per cent.
Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and ITC were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel, NTPC and L&T.
The benchmark BSE Sensex surged 203.97 points or 0.73 per cent to trade at a new record-high of 28,114.03 in the morning session, breaking its previous peak of 28,027.96 reached on November 10.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade and hit a new life-time high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-share NSE index crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points or 0.53 per cent to trade at a life-time high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said that the domestic sentiment remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed the trading sentiment, they added.
A report by Equentis Capital said: "We expect markets likely to remain positive. Stay cautious and book profits on higher levels. The government will unveil IIP data for September 2014 and annual rate of inflation based on the combined consumer price indices (CPI) for urban and rural India for October 2014 on 12 November 2014. Inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for October 2014 will be released on 14 November 2014. Slower inflation could support regulators (RBI) to increase liquidity in the market in short-term and positive action by the regulators will be good for interest sensitive sectors/stocks."
European stocks
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS , Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Asian shares
Asian stocks extended their gains for the fourth day as Japanese shares climbed after the yen depreciated to a seven-year low amid speculation the nation will delay raising its sales tax again.
Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Nikkei 225 rose 73 points or 0.43 per cent at 17,197 and Hang Seng jumped 184.08 points or 0.77 per cent at 23,992.36.

Car sales to grow sub-5 % this fiscal: SIAMThe Hindu While car sales had grown in the May-August period this year after a slump of two years, sales declined by 1.03 per cent in September. Photo: K.K.Mustafah

“Festival season has been subdued as compared to last year.”
Domestic car sales declined for the second consecutive month in October, falling 2.55 per cent as buying remained subdued during the festival season, which usually accounts for 30 per cent of annual sales for automobile firms.
2.55 % drop in October
Car sales were 1.59 lakh units last month against 1.63 lakh units in October, 2013, according to the data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
“Festival season has been subdued as compared to last year. The sentiment has become positive, but unless we have some real economic growth kicking in, we may not see automobile sales going up,” SIAM Deputy Director-General told reporters here.
There might be some revival in sales early next year. However, the passenger vehicle segment and passenger cars sales were expected to grow at sub-5 per cent this fiscal, he added.
In August, SIAM had forecast a growth of 5-10 per cent in passenger vehicles and cars for the current financial year.
While car sales had grown in the May-August period this year after a slump of two years, sales declined by 1.03 per cent in September.
Total two-wheeler sales too declined by 3.61 per cent to 14.62 lakh units, mainly due to fall in motorcycle sales. Motorcycle sales declined by 8.73 per cent to 10.09 lakh units last month from 11.06 lakh units a year earlier.
“Motorcycle sales will remain subdued till the end of the year. It follows a pattern. Last year, sales were up in October but fell in November, and this year sales were up last month and fell in October,” Mr. Sen said.
According to SIAM, total scooter sales stood at 3.84 lakh units in October, up 10.89 per cent.
Sales of commercial vehicles dropped by 2.97 per cent to 59,165 units in October. “CV sales have picked up as fleet owners have started getting ready as the sector has started to witness some activity,” Mr. Sen said.
With activities taking place again in sectors such as mining and infrastructure, the segment was witnessing some much needed growth, he added. Total sales of vehicles across categories registered 3.84 per cent decline of 3.84 per cent to 17.87 lakh units during the month under review from 18.59 lakh units in October 2013, SIAM said.

Paddy prices plummet as Iran goes slow onimportsGold futures price falls on global cues
Despondency is writ large on Kuldeep Singh’s face as the boli (auction) for the paddy that was unloaded from his tractor trolley at an open platform in Khanna’s grain mandi is concluded.
This five-acre farmer from Behlolpur, a village in Sirhind tehsil of Punjab’s Fatehpur Sahib district, has managed to realise R3,200 per quintal for his Pusa-1121 basmati crop, as against R4,100 last year. “The artiyas (commission agents) and even other farmers tell me I am lucky. The price I have received is the highest for this season,” he notes sarcastically.
Kuldeep’s information isn’t wrong. “Till a few weeks ago, Pusa-1121 was selling at R2,400-2,500 per quintal. It has since recovered to R3,100, but we are still way below last year when prices started at R3,000-3,100 around October 10 and reached R4,400-4,500 by the month-end,” says Pritam Singh, who farms 107 acres, including 77 acres taken on lease, at Urlana Khurd in Madlauda tehsil of Panipat, Haryana.
“Prices this time have generally ranged between R2,400 and R3,200 per quintal,” confirms Kuljinder Singh Sidhu, secretary of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee at Rajpura, Punjab’s biggest mandi after Khanna.
According to Wazir Singh Kohar, a 60-acre farmer from Theri village in Fatehabad district of Haryana, traders were blaming the price crash on low export demand: “Jo bhi ho, thaggi ho rahi hai (whatever be the reason, this is open loot)”.
For many farmers, compounding the disappointment is the fact that last year’s record prices had led them to significantly expand basmati acrea-ge, including by leasing in land.
Pargat Singh owns four acres at Kaddon village in Ludhiana’s Doraha tehsil. This year, he rented two acres at R15,000 per acre to plant more area under Pusa-1121. But returns on the investment have not matched his expectations.
These stories basically capture a remarkable phenomenon — of a crop where farmers rode on a wave of high export-driven prices and simultaneously benefited from new varietal technology.
Pusa-1121, an improved high-yielding basmati developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), was released for commercial cultivation in 2003 kharif season.
Between 2003-04 and 2013-14, India’s basmati rice exports zoomed from 7.71 lakh tonne (lt) to 37.54 lt. The increase was even more in value terms, from $433.73 million (R1,993.05 crore) to $ 4.86 billion (R29,291.82 crore). Pusa-1121’s share in total shipments last year was reckoned at over 70%.
This year, the situation is somewhat different though.
To start with, export prices have dropped. Parboiled Pusa-1121 rice is said to be fetching about $1,100 per tonne (landed cost, West Asia), compared to $1,400-plus at this time last year and $1,700 levels in March.
The main reason for this is Iran, which bought 14.41 lt or over 38% of India’s basmati shipments in 2013-14. “This year, their own Domsiah crop (a long-grain aromatic rice similar to basmati) is very good. Also, they have huge stocks from last year’s basmati purchases, prompting the government there to clamp 40% duty on imports. Lower demand from Iran, plus our farmers growing more basmati this time, is what is depressing prices,” Anil Kumar Mittal, chairman of KRBL, India’s largest rice miller and exporter, said.
India’s basmati paddy output this year is seen at 12 million tonne (mt), up from 8.5-9 mt of 2013-14. The 12 mt include 5 mt of Pusa-1121 and 2.5 mt of Pusa-1509, a newly-bred IARI variety. “12 mt paddy works out to 8 mt of rice. “If you take 4 mt exports and another 1.8-2 mt domestic consumption, there will still be a surplus of 2 mt left,” observes a trade source.
Ashok Gulati, former chairman, Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, points out: “The bull run in basmati is clearly over. The price correction that is happening now is only a reflection of that.”
RS Seshadri, general secretary of All India Rice Exporters’ Association, believes farmers in Punjab and Haryana will continue to plant basmati even next year. “With Pusa-1121, a farmer can harvest 18-20 quintal paddy per acre, which goes up to 23-24 quintals for Pusa-1509. On the other hand, yields in non-basmati parmal varieties, which are procured for the public distribution system and attract a minimum support price of R1,400 per quintal, are only 30 quintals. Even if basmati rates drop to R2,000/quintal, farm economics will still favour it over parmal paddy,” he adds.
The shift to basmati is perceptible from paddy acreage data. Basmati varieties are estimated to have accounted for 8.2 lakh hectares or 72% of Haryana’s total paddy area this year. The corresponding coverage was 8.66 lakh hectares or 31% for Punjab. “No farmer here grows parmal. The only paddy that comes to our mandi is basmati, especially Pusa-1121 and now increasingly Pusa-1509”, informs Vijay Arora, a leading artiya at Madlauda’s new grain market.
Seshadri projects basmati’s share even in Punjab to cross 50% in 3-4 years: “It is a good thing, as basmati needs less water and the government should focus on rice procurement more from Chhattisgarh and eastern India.”

NASA signs 60-year lease with GoogleNASA signs 60-year lease with Google to manage Moffett Federal Airfield
IANS     Washington   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 13:07 IST

In a bid to reduce costs and shed surplus property, the US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has signed a 60-year lease with Planetary Ventures LLC - a shell organisation operated by Google for real estate deals - to manage Moffett Federal Airfield (MFA) in California and restore its historic Hangar One.
Google will initially invest more than $200 million into the site, NASA said in a statement.
It is estimated that the lease will save the US space agency approximately $6.3 million annually in maintenance and operation costs and provide $1.16 billion in rent.
MFA, currently maintained by NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, includes approximately 1,000 acres of land located on South San Francisco Bay.
The land includes Hangars One, Two and Three, an airfield flight operations building, two runways and a private golf course.
"As NASA expands its presence in space, we are making strides to reduce our footprint here on Earth," said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.
"We want to invest taxpayer resources in scientific discovery, technology development and space exploration - not in maintaining infrastructure we no longer need. Moffett Field plays an important role in the Bay Area and is poised to continue to do so through this lease arrangement," Bolden continued.
After a fair and open competition, the US General Services Administration (GSA) and NASA selected Planetary Ventures, LLC as the preferred lessee in February 2014 and began lease negotiations.
"Hangar One is an important landmark in Silicon Valley . GSA was proud to support NASA in delivering the best value to taxpayers while restoring this historic facility and enhancing the surrounding community," added GSA administrator Dan Tangherlini.
"We look forward to rolling up our sleeves to restore the remarkable landmark Hangar One, which for years has been considered one of the most endangered historic sites in the United States," noted David Radcliffe, vice president of real estate and workplace services at Google.
The negotiated lease will put Hangar One to new use and eliminate NASA's management costs of the airfield, with the federal government retaining title to the property, the statement added.

Lufthansa to start Airbus A380 flights to Mumbai from 2015Editorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
German airline Lufthansa has announced it will start operating the world’s largest commercial aircraft the Airbus A380 to Mumbai starting next summer.
Wolfgang Will, Director South Asia, said the airline plans to start flying between Mumbai and Frankfurt with the A380 from July-August 2015. This is despite the Mumbai airport, unlike the one in Delhi, having just one position/slot to land the A380.
The airline had earlier this week launched the A380 flights between Frankfurt and Delhi. The launch of the A380 flight to Delhi will see the airline offering 140 more seats a day from what was offered earlier. Similarly, the launch of the A380 to Mumbai will see the airline offering 170 more seats a day.
Will also announced that Lufthansa will offer ‘premium/economy’ seating to passengers flying between Bangalore and Frankfurt from November 22 this year. Lufthansa had launched the ‘premium/economy’ class (in between economy and business) globally this year.

Data tariffs may fall 20 pct with Reliance Jio Infocomm s entry  but no tariff war expected: FitchThe entry of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm in the telecom space will intensify competition and may bring data tariffs down by at least 20 per cent, Fitch Ratings said today.
It, however, said no tariff wars are expected as witnessed during the 2009-2013 period.
“The likely entry of new telco Reliance Jio, which is a part of Reliance Industries Ltd in 1H15 will intensify competition in the data segment, and may cause data tariffs to decline by at least 20 per cent,” Fitch said in its 2015 outlook for Indian telecommunications services.
Reliance Industries had announced that it would launch commercial 4G telecom service of Reliance Jio in 2015 entailing investment of Rs 70,000 crore.
Fitch said Jio will focus largely on data and may have a limited impact on the incumbents’ core voice business, given a weak “voice-over-LTE” technology ecosystem and lack of affordable 4G-compatible handsets in India.
“We do not foresee a re-run of the tariff wars of 2009-2013, which led to a severe decline in industry tariffs,” Fitch said.
Fitch expects the top four Indian telcos – Bharti Airtel Limited (Bharti; BBB-/Stable), Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications – to increase their revenue market share to around 83 per cent by 2015 from the current 79 per cent in the USD-30 billion industry.
“Industry revenue will grow by at a mid-single-digit rate in 2015, driven by data services. The top four telcos’ 2015 average operating EBITDA margin will be mostly unchanged at 32-33 per cent (2014: 32 per cent) as a decline in data tariffs will offset a gradual rise in voice tariffs,” it said.
Fitch said the top four telcos will generate a minimal free cash flow (FCF) margin due to higher capex and flat EBITDA; the 2015 industry capex/revenue ratio could rise as fast-growing data traffic requires supporting investment.

Investment climate not right: Japanese MinisterJapan
Fund flow will depend on economic reforms, says Yasutoshi Nishimura
Striking a note of caution about India’s “environment for investment,” a Minister in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s office said the government must roll out economic reforms, build up infrastructure and cut red tape if the $35 billion promised during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Japan were to be actualised. “So long as there is a step-by-step forward movement, I think the expectations can be reached,” said State Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura in an exclusive interview to The Hindu.
“Japanese companies will move forward with investment, but only if there is a visibility with regard to these reforms.”
He clarified that the $35 billion or 3.5 trillion yen committed was a combination of government outlay for Indian transport infrastructure and the projected expectation from private companies. Much of the public investment will be in the $100 billion Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, metro transport, and bullet train technology.
Speaking at the India Global Forum organised by IISS and ORF, Mr. Nishimura had also hit out at the lack of infrastructure, including transport and power, saying Maruti Suzuki’s Indian plants had to depend on private generators.
“Despite the quite large investment to date, infrastructure development is not catching up with rapid economic growth. This is a major bottleneck for growth,” he added.
Government’s initiatives forward-looking: Nishimura
At the India Global Forum on Sunday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had conceded that building investor confidence was the government’s big worry, saying, “One of the principal challenges is to restore confidence in the Indian economy, to expand economic activity and increase the growth rate.”
Japan was the first country to commit major investment to Mr. Modi’s economic outreach, but is by no means the biggest investor in India. According to industry reports, India accounts only for 1.2% of Japan’s FDI, as opposed to 8.8% for China. Also, India-Japan trade accounts for just 2% of India’s total trade and 1% of Japan’s.
Conceding that the government’s initiatives including the setting up of a special “Japan-plus” desk at the Commerce Ministry’s Department of Investment Promotion were “forward-looking,” Mr. Nishimura told The Hindu, “We very clearly see the government’s desire for promoting and encouraging investment. In fact many companies are thinking once again of investing in India. What they have been asking for is an improvement in administrative procedures in India.”

Amtek Auto stock rises over 17% on loan from KKRAmtek Auto stock rises over 17% on loan from KKR
BT Online Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 17:33 IST
Amtek Auto stock shot up by over 17 per cent on Tuesday as its unit Amtek Global Technologies secured a long-term loan of 235 million euro (over Rs 1,800 crore) from global investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
The Amtek Auto scrip zoomed 17.12 per cent to settle at Rs 192.25 on the BSE. During the day, it had rallied 19.28 per cent to Rs 195.80.
On the NSE, the stock closed the day at Rs 192, up 17.14 per cent from the previous close.
The company's market capitalisation rose by Rs 619.61 crore to Rs 4,235.61 crore.
In terms of volume, 13.09 lakh shares of the company changed hands at the BSE, while more than 75 lakh shares were traded at the NSE during the day.
As part of the definitive agreement inked between the two firms, KKR will provide AGT 235 million euro of long-term, flexible financing to replace its existing bridge loan and consolidate all of the company's existing debt.
"This facility will also act as a catalyst to help integrate Amtek Auto's existing international operations under the Singapore headquartered AGT," the companies had said in a joint statement on Monday.
The Amtek Group, which has annual turnover of over $2.7 billion and manages 65 world-class facilities, produces components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and two- and three-wheelers.

India gets minister for yoga and traditional medicineNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
India has set up a ministry to promote alternative therapies such as yoga and traditional ayurveda medicine, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarks on a mission to raise awareness and the appeal of home-grown health treatments.
Modi has repeatedly called for greater use of India’s health remedies and exercises, part of a push to promote traditional learning. During his first address at the United Nations in September, he encouraged more people to take up yoga and called for an International Yoga Day.
“This is our system and it has not received enough prominence. We will take it to the masses,” said Shripad Naik, who took charge of the ministry on Tuesday.
The formation of the ministry comes days after the government unveiled plans to set up a regulator for traditional drugs. India wants to expand its presence in the estimated $100 billion global market for alternative medicine.
Ayurvedic and other types of traditional medicine, called unani and siddha, are popular in smaller towns, and yoga has a huge following across India and in the West. Homeopathy also finds wide acceptance in India.
Use of traditional medicines is also promoted by country’s most popular yoga guru, Swami Ramdev. He sells ayurvedic medicines and holds yoga camps attended by thousands in India and abroad.
But critics often question the effectiveness of traditional remedies over modern medicine. Modi said on Sunday ayurveda and mainstream drugs were not mutually exclusive.
“There is a need for larger awareness in ayurveda. It can’t be limited to a doctor only. Our ancestors made good health a part of life,” he said.
The success of the new ministry would depend on additional budgetary allocation, a government official told Reuters. The government allocated 10.69 billion rupees ($174 million) to develop and promote traditional health systems in the 2014-15 financial year.
“We have not got the attention … We are looking for a steep rise in our funding for next year,” said the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Modi wants cabinet colleagues to allocate work to juniorsPrint

By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 7:03 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 7:07 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who expanded his Council of Ministers earlier this week, wants his Cabinet colleagues to distribute work to their juniors.
The strength of the NDA government, which was 45, has now gone up to 66 after the Prime Minister expanded his Council of Ministers and reshuffled portfolios on Sunday.
Of this, 27 including the Prime Minister are of Cabinet rank, 13 Ministers of State with independent charge and 26 Ministers of State.
Chaudhary Birender Singh, who took over as the Minister for Rural Development, Drinking Water and Sanitation and Panchayti Raj, today said he would implement Modi’s directive in a proper way and allocate powers vested in him to his junior ministers.
“I and my three colleagues will sit together every Wednesday and discuss issues related to the ministries. I will ensure that ministers of state in my ministries enjoy the same power as those vested in me,” Singh told reporters here.
Singh has three juniors in the Ministry.
While Sudarshan Bhagat is the Minister of State for Rural Development, Nihal Chand is the Minister of State for Panchayati Raj and Ram Kripal Yadav is the Minister of State for Drinking Water and Sanitation.
“We will see that our Ministers of State are equally empowered,” Chaudhary said.
Several Ministers of State in the erstwhile UPA had complained to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about hesitance of cabinet ministers to allocate work to their juniors.
As Modi’s Council of Ministers got ready to be sworn in on May 26, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor had sought to put cold water on the enthusiasm of a host of to-be Ministers of State, saying “being MoS is like standing in a cemetery”.
“Advice to some being sworn in today: Being MoS is like standing in a cemetery — there’s a lot of people under you but no one is listening!” Tharoor had said in a tweet.
Tharoor was the Minister of State for HRD in the Manmohan Singh Ministry.

Aadhaar card may be must for passport issuanceEYE BROWSE
Govt keen to make Aadhaar card must for passport issuance
The move could spark off a debate since the Supreme Court has ruled that Aadhaar cannot be mandatory for government subsidies and social schemes.
By Abhishek Bhalla | Mail Today –  Tue 11 Nov, 2014

NEW DELHI: The Centre wants to make the Aadhaar card mandatory for acquiring a passport and the ministry of external affairs (MEA) is working closely with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to implement the measure at the earliest.
“In the new process, the applicant, if not in possession of an Aadhaar card, has to produce the Aadhaar enrolment number,” said a note prepared by the MEA that was sent to the law ministry, home ministry and the Intelligence Bureau, which was part of deliberations on the subject.
The MEA wants to put this in place by the end of the month.
The move could spark off a debate since the Supreme Court has ruled that Aadhaar, one of the flagship schemes of the previous UPA government, cannot be mandatory for government subsidies and social schemes. “This is the reason the law ministry has been roped in and the subject will be discussed with all stakeholders,” said a government official.
The MEA’s proposal is part of a plan for simplifying police verification required before a passport can be issued. A number of complaints are being received regularly regarding issues related to police verification and consequent delay in issuing passports.
Checking the criminal antecedents of applicants is a longdrawn process that too leads to delays. This has prompted the central government to put in place a new mechanism.
The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) is setting up a system for verifying criminal antecedents of applicants.
“The NCRB has confirmed that they will be able to set up the validation mechanism within two months.
Once this is established, the criminal antecedents of the applicants will be validated on the NCRB database before passport issuance,” the MEA’s note said.
The MEA is of the view that when an applicant already has an Aadhaar card or has applied for it, the identity is established to a major extent but this needs to be confirmed by UIDAI. The UIDAI has issued nearly 70 crore Aadhaar cards, according to the latest data, and the NDA government recently gave fresh impetus to the scheme by linking it to several programmes such as MGNREGA, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna , pensions and even attendance systems in government offices. Aadhaar has covered 90 per cent of the population in nine states, including Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh.
After the NDA government came to power, there was speculation that the Aadhaar card project started by the UPA would take a backseat but that did not happen as the new dispensation gave it a push. The budget presented by the NDA government indicated that it intends to continue Aadhaar enrolments because a sum of Rs 2,039 crore was provided for the project.

Bangalore college girl lodges rape complaint against army man fatherPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:40 am
A 19-year-old girl from Uttar Pradesh pursuing a commerce degree in Bengaluru has accused her father, a hawaldar in the Indian Army, of allegedly sexually abusing over the past five years. The complaint comes close on the heels of the havaldar filing a kidnap complaint against the girl’s boyfriend with whom she had eloped a month ago.
The Vidyaranyapura police in North Bangalore who registered a case on the basis of the complaint of the 19-year-old said that the girl had been reported missing a month ago after she ran away with a distant relative Amith Kumar Singh who was staying at their home. The girl’s father an army havaldar had attempted to crack down on his daughter’s relationship with Singh and had sent the youth back to UP last month.
However, his daughter also allegedly eloped with Singh resulting in the havaldar filing a police complaint of kidnap against Singh at the Vidyaranyapuram police station.
The girl recently returned home and told the police that she was not kidnapped and that she went with Singh of her own volition. She also provided proof that she was not a minor. The police had closed the kidnap case based on the statement of the girl. Police said the girl approached them again last week to file a complaint against her father. She has alleged in the complaint that she has been sexually abused by her father.
The police have taken up a case of rape based on the complaint lodged by the victim and further investigations are on to find out whether the allegations are true or false.
The Vidyaranyapura police said they had written a requisition letter to the Indian Army seeking permission to question the havaldar. “We are waiting for a reply from the Indian Army to interrogate and arrest the accused person,” an investigating officer said.

Sebi Issues Discussion Paper to Make  Non-Event  Reporting MandatoryGold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said it is revamping the listing agreement in general and Clause 36 in particular to make it mandatory for corporates to disclose "non-events" for the benefit of investors.
"To build trust, we are reviewing Clause 36 of the listing agreement under which corporates have to disclose non-events. We found that disclosures are just fill in the blanks now. We have issued a discussion paper on Clause 36 so that investors get meaningful information," Sebi Whole-Time Member Prashant Saran said at a conference here.
Corporates would be required to disclose non-events such as loss of market share or technology obsolescence on a periodic basis (annually to start with) to shareholders through an exchange filing, Mr Saran said.
"Investors have lost trust in the last decade and right now the imperative is to build trust and we have to build it assiduously."
"We have been reviewing Clause 36 of the listing agreement (for timeliness and adequacy) and have suggested that corporates disclose all material events in a manner such that investors will get a meaningful understanding," Mr Saran said.
Outlining the future of corporate disclosures, he said companies would have to incorporate such information in the annual information memorandum and periodically update the prospectus filed by them at the time of IPOs.
This would provide secondary market investors with updated and vital information besides enabling companies to file for future capital raising in the form of rights or follow-on public offerings, he said.
Sebi issued the discussion paper on August 19, 2014, and it is expected to be taken up during the next board meeting of the regulator scheduled for November 19.
Clause 36 requires a listed entity to disclose details of all events, which will have a bearing on its performance/operations, as well as price sensitive information to stock exchanges immediately.
This usually consists of information on events like labour strikes, lock-outs, closure on account of power cuts among others.

Top badminton player suspended over doping violationPrint
REUTERS - Malaysia's world number one Lee Chong Wei has been provisionally suspended for an "apparent" anti-doping violation, the Badminton World Federation (BWF) said on Tuesday.
"The world-governing body has imposed this suspension due to an Adverse Analytical Finding of a sample taken at the BWF World Championships in August," the BWF said in a statement.
"The BWF has referred the matter to the BWF Doping Hearing Panel and, in due course, the Chair of the Panel will set the time, date and location of a hearing.
"The Panel will determine whether or not the athlete has committed an anti-doping regulation violation," it added.
On Saturday, the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) confirmed that one of their players had tested positive for the banned anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone but withheld the individual's identity pending an appeal.
The 32-year-old Lee, however, posted messages on his official Twitter and Facebook accounts thanking fans for their support and denying using drugs to gain an advantage.
"I just want to thank every one of you who had faith in me through this difficult times. There are so many unanswered questions and I hope to clear my name soon," he wrote.
"I never cheated nor will I ever rely on banned substances."
Should Lee fail with his appeal, the Malaysian faces a two-year ban and will be stripped of the silver medal he won at the world championships in Copenhagen in August, the location of his positive test.
He would also be likely to lose the two bronze medals he won at the Asian Games in September in the individual and team events.

Inflation Seen Cooling Further in October, May Not Budge RBI
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 12:58 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Bangalore: Indian inflation is expected to slow to a record-low in October, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, a Reuters poll showed, probably intensifying calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India.
The survey of 27 economists and analysts predicted consumer price inflation (CPI), scheduled for release on Wednesday, cooled to an annual 5.80 per cent in October.
If the forecast is met, it will be even lower than September's 6.46 per cent and the slowest pace of price rises since retail inflation numbers were first published in January 2012.
It would also make the RBI's inflation targets - 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent a year later - appear more attainable.
Wholesale price inflation is forecast to ease to a near five-year low of 2.20 per cent in October from September's 2.38 per cent, the Reuters poll showed. This data will be released on Friday.
The recent slowdown in inflation has largely been due to falls in local food prices, which account for 50 per cent of the CPI basket, and Capital Economics' India economist Shilan Shah said it could still go lower.
"Over the coming months, we suspect that both measures of inflation will remain subdued by past standards," Shah said.
The poll also predicted industrial production to have increased a meager 0.6 per cent in September, albeit better than August's 0.4 per cent.
A poor factory output number on Wednesday will imply Asia's third-largest economy may struggle to maintain a recent pickup in growth.
"Monetary loosening could come onto the agenda sooner than most seem to expect," Shah said.
He said the RBI could cut its benchmark repo rate by 100 basis points to 7.00 per cent over the next 12 to 18 months.
However, some say the RBI may not want to release the monetary policy brakes in a hurry.
"These releases will point to slowing industrial activity alongside slippery inflation - a combination that will add to the growing chorus for rate cuts in December," said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS.
"But the RBI is unlikely to oblige."
It will wait for more clarity on inflation and rates could stay unchanged until March, after the government releases its budget, Rao added.
A Reuters poll last month showed economists expect the RBI to keep its key repo rate steady at 8.0 per cent well into next year, as it remains wary of a sudden surge in inflation due to a spike in food and oil prices.

CAG finds schools in Gujarat functioning under trees & temporary sheltersPrint
Written by Avinash Nair | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:39 pm
The Gujarat-model of education seems has been criticised by none other than the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), after the country’s top audit watch dog found glaring lacunae in the way elementary schools were being run in the state. CAG found schools in Gujarat functioning under trees and temporary shelters.
CAG found that even after four years from the date of enactment of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 or the RTE Act, many of the schools in Gujarat had not been provided with buildings, adequate teachers and basic amenities like drinking water. These facilities were to be provided to all schools by August 2012, observed CAG in a report on Local Bodies that was tabled in the Gujarat legislative Assembly on Tuesday.
In Gujarat there are 31,545 elementary school managed by Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) as on March 31, 2013. These consisted of 10,188 primary schools with stand I-V and 21,357 upper primary schools with standard I-VIII.
CAG checked 10 districts that had 14,797 elementary schools between 2008-13 and found that 48 schools did not have their own buildings and 56 schools were in dilapidated condition, in need of repairs. That’s not all. 14 more schools did not have their own buildings.
During the field visits undertaken in Junagadh district, the auditor found a primary school in Dodhi Nes (shown in records as functioning in its own school building) to be operating from a temporary shelter. Another school in Hadala Nes in the same district to be functioning under a tree. CAG has printed the pictures of both these schools in the report which stated that the RTE Act necessitates schools to have an all-weather building.
The RTE Act also provides that a school should have at least one class-room for every teacher with the provision that there would be at least two class rooms in primary schools and three class rooms in Upper Primary Schools. “Audit observed that though sufficient funds were available, due to lack of planning 10 percent (or 3146 schools) of the 31,545 elementary schools were functioning without adequate class-rooms (July 2013),” the report stated. The percentage of inadequacy of class-rooms in Gujarat ranged from one percent (Surat district) to as high as 53 percent in Jamnagar district.
Out of the 300 schools visited by CAG, the pupil-class room ratio (PCRR) in 38 schools was above the norm of 40:1 provided under the RTE Act. An eye-brow raising PCRR of 108:1 was observed in Shamalpur primary school in Bhiloda taluka of Sabarkantha district. “The strength of these classes were more than that envisaged under RTE Act, which adversely affected the quality of education,” CAG observed.
CAG also noticed that safe and adequate drinking water facility was not ensured for students in 175 (58 percent) of the 300 schools visited. Moreover, 82 percent of these schools did not have disabled friendly toilets, while in nine percent of them there were no separate toilets for girls and boys, an issues that have been raised a countless times continued…

NBFCs May Take 0.40% Hit in Profits Post-New Norms: AnalystsGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
Mumbai: The new framework for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to bring down their profitability by around 40 basis points, or 0.40 per cent, over the next four years, analysts said on Tuesday.
To better address the risks in the business, enhance regulatory coverage, standardise regulations and improve governance standards, the RBI on Monday revised the guidelines for NBFCs, which are to be implemented over the next three financial years.
(Read: Reserve Bank Tightens Rules for NBFCs )
Among other things, the RBI tightened the NPA recognition and provisioning norms for NBFCs to bring them on a par with those applicable for commercial banks.
"The revised regulation will slice around 40 basis points off NBFCs' profitability gradually over the next four years till March 2018," Crisil said in a report.
The rating agency said the decline in profit will be on account of higher provisioning with the stricter recognition norms for non-performing assets (NPAs) made more stringent to 90+ days past due (dpd) from 180+ earlier.
Another rating outfit Icra said the changes are likely to lead to a rise in the reported gross NPA percentage from 4.5 as of June 2014 to 6-8 per cent once they are fully enforced, thereby increasing incremental credit provisioning.
Over the medium term, delinquencies could settle at a lower level as NBFCs realign their monitoring and recovery systems to the 90-day format and as the operating environment improves, alleviating the pressure on the credit profiles of borrowers, Icra said.
Crisil, however, said the three-year transition period will allow NBFCs to cushion impact on their financial profiles.
Icra said the returns on assets of NBFCs as a whole could also drop by 20 bps, which would translate into a 1.1-1.3 per cent dip in returns on equity.
The new guidelines raised the minimum Tier I capital requirements for these financial entities from the current 7.5 to 8.5 per cent by March 2016 and 10 per cent by March 2017.
Most NBFCs maintain a favourable capital structure, and this would enable them to meet the enhanced capital requirements.
"In our estimates, only two or three NBFCs would need to be mobilise additional capital (of around Rs 500 crore or 8-10 per cent of their net worth) to maintain a 2 per cent buffer over the revised Tier I capital requirements," Icra said.

DGFT asked to come up with uniform norms for easing gold salesDGFT asked to come up with uniform norms for easing gold sales

Small firms complain that selective easing of import ban is hurting them
New Delhi, November 11:  
In an effort to ensure small jewellers and traders are not marginalised, the Government is working on a set of “common principles” for banks, public sector agencies and large private traders on gold sales.
The Department of Revenue has instructed the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to look into the matter and come up with a workable solution.
This follows a Delhi High Court direction to the Centre asking it to resolve the problem of availability of gold to small players, highlighted in a writ petition filed by the Delhi Bullion and Jewellers Welfare Association (DBJWA). “The selling norms of all entities are different. Banks have a policy of favouring old and preferred customers. Some PSUs such as MMTC do it on a ‘first-come, first-served’ basis, while some such as PEC conduct auctions. The private sector functions on its own. We are trying to lay down some common principles, if not enforceable guidelines, for all,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine.
UPA decision
The DBJWA had contested a decision of the former UPA Government taken in May, just days before demitting office, to ease gold import rules for star trading houses and premium trading houses. The association claims that large trading houses will now end up controlling the domestic gold market, leaving small players out in the cold.
“Because of the Government’s orders, bullion import went into limited hands,” said Vimal Goel, President of DBJWA. The association now wants the decision to be reserved so that small traders and jewellers also have access to enough gold.
Last year, restrictions were imposed on import of gold by the Government to bridge the widening current account deficit. Gold imports reduced considerably following the restrictions, but have shot up again after the erstwhile UPA Government removed restrictions on large traders.
“While the issue of easing import norms for large traders will be examined by the RBI and the Finance Ministry, what the DGFT has been asked to do is to see that small traders and jewellers also have access to gold available within the system,” the official said.
The DGFT is holding meetings with all the stakeholders to narrow down on what the common guidelines could be, and it is turning out to be a difficult task.
“Our job is to brainstorm. The mandate given by the High Court is to resolve the issue, and our consultations are on. We have to see if something workable comes out,” the official added.

IFC Sells Rupee Bonds, Raises Rs 1,000 Crore for Axis Bank
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 11, 2014 23:42 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Mumbai: The World Bank Group's development finance body, IFC, on Tuesday raised Rs 1,000 crore through a 10-year bond, which will be invested in private sector lender Axis Bank's forthcoming infra bond issue.
Christened as 'Masala Bonds', the latest issuance is a part of the corporation's $2-billion offshore rupee bond programme and will be the first such offering to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Washington-based developmental body said in a statement issued here.
Proceeds from the latest issue will support a forthcoming infrastructure bond issuance by Axis Bank, the statement said.
It can be noted that Axis Bank, the country's third largest private sector lender, is targeting to raise up to Rs 6,000 crore by March through the long-term infra bond instrument issued by the Reserve Bank (RBI) in July.
"The IFC Masala Bonds set a triple-A benchmark for offshore rupee issuances and pave the way for more foreign investment to help meet the country's private sector development needs," said Tarun Bajaj, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
Among all the rupee-denominated issues by IFC until now, the latest offering has the longest maturity at 10 years, keeping in mind the needs of the longer gestation infrastructure projects, it said, adding that the others have been in the 3, 5 and 7-year buckets.
"This bond issue demonstrates the powerful role that capital markets can play in linking international savings to infrastructure investment. The strong demand from investors signals continued momentum for the Indian economy," IFC chief executive Jin-Yong Cai said.
The yield for the bonds has been set at 6.3 per cent, it said, adding that J P Morgan was the sole arranger for the issuance.
The rupee-denominated bonds help deepen the process of internationalisation of the rupee and involve raising money in an international currency, which is brought onshore and converted into rupee in the domestic spot market.
Repayment will be as per the existing exchange rate of the rupee against the international currency.

10 Things I Wish I Knew at Age 22 About WorkI've spent a decade running circles in the rat race going from one company to the next. Only recently have I finally set myself free from my work cage and started working on things that I truly care about.
And it feels great.
Don't get me wrong. I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to work over the course of my 10-year corporate career in reputable companies, including Alibaba, Cisco, Box, and SanDisk. From these experiences, I've come away with 10 lessons about work and the corporate world that I wish I could have known when I had graduated college at age 22.
I share this list with you so that you hopefully can learn from my experiences. Ultimately, it's my hope that you are able to do the work that you were created to do, no matter what stage of life you are in.
1. The worst investment you can make in life is trading hours for dollars.
Time is the most valuable currency in life. Once you start falling into the trap of trading in your most valuable time of each day to a job that doesn't provide meaning for you, you give up a small piece of yourself each day that you continue in this vicious cycle. Trading your hours purely for a paycheck and the promise of deferred dreams -- vacations, house, savings, retirement, etc. -- is the worst investment you can make in the most productive time of your life.
2. Job security is a fallacy, at any position.
Getting a good job at a stable company doesn't guarantee anything. New hires are called "headcount" for a reason. People can be fired as easily as they are hired. I've seen it at every level of the company, even at the biggest of companies. Not even the CEO or the VPs are immune to being cut. On the contrary, the higher up on the ladder you are, the more scrutinized your position becomes.
3. Your work will be your life.
What you do from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. is your life. Most corporate environments in America are so pressure packed that clocking in only eight hours a day is looked down upon. Coming in early and leaving late is viewed as the norm. Emails on weeknights and prepping for the week with emails on Sunday nights doesn't leave any room for headspace to do the other things in your life like taking care of your family, cooking, exercising, reading, etc.
4. You are the company you keep.
You spend more time with your co-workers than you do with any other people in your life. And unfortunately, a lot of the time spent in the corporate world is consumed by making efforts to fit-in. You're judged on what you wear to work, how you interact with others, what results you're bringing to the team, and how "dedicated" you are. And because you need to pretend to fit-in, if your co-workers--especially those higher up on the ladder than you--have a different value system or lifestyle than you, eventually you'll be forced to make hard decisions about what's really right and wrong. Choose your company wisely.
5. Your boss is the most important relationship you'll have at work. Make sure it's a good one.
It's been proven in studies that the single most important factor in job satisfaction is a healthy relationship with one's boss. I've experienced both ends of the spectrum and can affirm that your relationship with your boss will make or break your success at work. When your boss believes in you, trusts you, and gives you the autonomy and flexibility to make your contributions, you'll flourish and be handsomely rewarded in your work. On the opposite end of the spectrum, when your boss is insecure, power hungry, or just has a bad attitude, you'll never enjoy the success you've dreamed about because your boss will suffocate any chance for that to happen.
6. Trust your gut -- about the work, the opportunity, your boss, and your colleagues.
The job interview is a two-way street -- you're there to interview the people you'll be working with, just as much as they're there to interview you for the position. Every time I've veered from following my gut and have become blinded by the promise of stock options or a promotion, I've made bad decisions. Hindsight is 20/20 and like anything in life, you need to trust your gut and follow the hunger that truly motivates you every day.
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma -- which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."
~Steve Jobs
7. Start by asking yourself, Why?
More specifically, ask yourself, Why do I want to work here? Why do I want to do this? If the first things that pop in your head are money, stock options, and career advancement, then stop to think again. Really think long and hard about your Why. Is it happiness, mastery, autonomy, independence, and/or creative freedom that you're after? Is it optimal work-life balance? Is it an opportunity to challenge yourself to grow and make the change you want to see in the world? If not, then perhaps the position that you're looking at isn't for you. If you go after a position that only offers you external satisfaction (money, status, etc.), then chances are you're not going to be content in that position once you actually get all the external things you were chasing after.
8. Quality of life is more important than the quantity in life.
60-80 hour workweeks, 4-6 hours of sleep each day. This is the sad reality of a lot of people in the corporate world. When you overwork yourself, everything else suffers. Your health declines, your quality of sleep gets worse, your stress level increases, and your relationships suffer. If you're a workaholic and earning loads of money, in the end, is the sacrifice really worth it? You get flashier cars, bigger houses, vacation homes, fancy watches, and expensive meals. But do you actually get to enjoy any of it without your health, energy, time, and relationships intact? Quality trumps quantity. Aim for quality.
9. You'll make money doing things that you are passionate about, even if it's not obvious at first.
The people who are truly successful at what they do are the people who love what they do. And when I say love, they absolutely, unequivocally love what they do. I once heard a famous venture capitalist answer the question of how he makes his investments. He said that he invests in people who have a fire in their belly that drives them to make their ideas a reality. The great writers, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, and entrepreneurs throughout history were truly great -- and monetarily rewarded -- because they had a deep, undeniable passion for their craft.
10. Own your story.
We all have a story to tell with our lives. Your story is unique to who you are and the experiences in your life. Don't ever let anyone try to write your story for you. Own your story, live it, breathe it, and write it every day of your life. Steven Pressfield said it best in The War of Art -- "Creative work is...a gift to the world and every being in it. Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got."

End to Bali impasse in sight at G-20Narendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Following recent engagements at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) headquarters in Geneva with prominent members of the world body, including the US, India on Tuesday indicated that a solution is in sight to end the impasse on the implementation of the Bali package to liberalise global trade. India’s demand for a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding on food security had led to the WTO missing a deadline on the trade facilitation agreement — a key element of the package.
“Those who said the lights at the WTO will be flipped off are wrong. Lights are on and it will continue to stay on,” an official in the know of the recent developments said.
“India is hopeful that things will be sorted out soon. The country is hopeful that WTO membership will respect India’s position and will accept the solution which is under discussion,” the official said, hinting that this week’s G-20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, is expected to witness some positive announcements in this regard.
Commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said on Sunday that the US and the European Union now are better appreciating India’s stance on food security as well as the importance of a course correction to reach a solution soon.
“I expect that there will be a greater engagement and some solution will come out of it which will calm down everyone questioning whether or not the Bali agreement will be recognised or whether it will all come down,” she said, days ahead of the G-20 summit — where leaders of the world’s 20 major economies will, among other things, discuss ways to restore confidence in the multilateral trading system and the WTO.
India was not trying to undermine the trade facilitation agreement (TFA), the minister said, and termed the WTO’s Bali package (on public stockholding for food security in developing countries, trade facilitation and a package for least developed countries) imperfect.
“Government’s sovereign duty to protect its poor farmers is seen (by the developed world) as trade distorting. If the course correction has to happen, it has to happen now and that is what we (India) are demanding. We may not be waiting till 2017 to get what is due and what is not trade distorting,” she said, adding that India is committed to WTO as it believes in multilateralism as opposed to regionalism.
The Prime Minister’s Office had recently held a meeting with the commerce ministry on the WTO negotiations in the wake of the readiness shown by the US to discuss India’s concerns on food security. Although India is unlikely to retract from its tough stance on the issue, sources said, it is evaluating a proposal for “a perpetual peace clause” till a “permanent solution” is found on the issue.
A peace clause like this would ensure that developing countries like are not taken to world body’s dispute settlement panel even if their domestic support to farmers crosses the limits prescribed.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Barack Obama and WTO director-general Roberto Azevedo are among the leaders slated to attend the G20 summit.
The Bali package had an interim ‘peace clause’ preventing WTO members from taking any developing country to the dispute settlement panel for violating the norms that the ‘trade distorting’ (agricultural) domestic support should not be over 10% of the total production. The package also said members should work on a permanent solution to reach agreement by December 2017.
India has since said it is not opposed to the TFA, but added that while members engaged seriously and with commitment on TFA to quickly resolve issues, the same enthusiasm and urgency was not shown on the issue of food security. The EU had earlier said a confirmation of the open-ended nature of the interim solution can most probably be achieved. Once the Bali package is amended to include such a perpetual peace clause, India will not then come in the way of signing the TFA, the sources said.
Bris-bane or boon?
The US and the EU now are better appreciating India’s stance on food security as well as the importance of a course correction to reach a solution soon
India had termed the Bali package (on public stockholding for food security in developing countries, TFA and a package for least developed countries) imperfect
India’s demand for a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding on food security had led to the WTO missing a deadline on the trade facilitation agreement — a key element of the package

Russia to build more nuclear reactors inIranRussia signed a contract Tuesday to build two more nuclear reactors in Iran to be possibly followed by another six.
By: Associated Press | Moscow | Posted: November 12, 2014 6:18 am
Russia signed a contract Tuesday to build two more nuclear reactors in Iran to be possibly followed by another six, a move intended to cement closer ties between the two nations.
The deal comes less than two weeks ahead of the November 24 deadline for Tehran to sign an agreement on its nuclear program with six world powers. Tuesday’s contract has no immediate relation to the talks that involve Russia and the United States, but it reflects Moscow’s intention to deepen its cooperation with Tehran ahead of possible softening of Western sanctions against Iran.
Nuclear officials from the two countries signed a contract Tuesday for building two reactors at Iran’s first Russia-built nuclear plant in Bushehr.
Sergei Kiriyenko, the head of Russia’s Rosatom state corporation, and Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi also signed a protocol envisaging possible construction of two more reactors in Bushehr and another four in an undetermined location.
“It’s a turning point in the development of relations between our countries,” Salehi said after the signing, according to Russian news reports.
Rosatom said in a statement that the construction of the new reactors will be monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. As in the case of Bushehr’s first reactor that became operational in 2013, Russia will supply uranium fuel and then take it back for reprocessing – a provision intended to prevent a possibility of Iran using the spent fuel to build atomic weapons.
A potential agreement between Iran and the six powers would ease Western sanctions against Iran’s economy if Tehran agrees to limit its uranium enrichment to a level that would make it unable to build nuclear weapons. Iran has dismissed Western suspicions that it was working covertly to develop nuclear weapons, insisted that its nuclear activities are aimed at peaceful energy demands and medical needs.

West confronts Putin at Asia-Pacific summit over Ukraine crisis andMH17Putin had a close-up brush with Western anger over the Ukraine crisis and the downing of Flight MH17.
By: Agence-France Presse | Beijing | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:44 am
Russian President Vladimir Putin had a close-up brush with Western anger over the Ukraine crisis and the downing of Flight MH17, as the White House warned that his sanctions-hit government was staring at “isolation”.
Putin held separate bilateral meetings in Beijing with US President Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott — after the latter had used colourful sporting terminology to demand a face-to-face encounter with the Russian strongman.
But the Kremlin said that on the fate of the Malaysia Airlines plane at least, which the West says was downed by a Russian missile supplied to pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine, Putin was not standing in the way of a full and transparent accounting.
The White House said Obama and Putin had met three times today on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Chinese capital, which was taking place ahead of a G20 summit to be hosted by Abbott in Australia this weekend.
“Their conversations covered Iran, Syria, and Ukraine,” National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan told reporters in Beijing.
Both Russia and the United States are involved in the P5+1 talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, but on Syria Moscow is a key ally of Bashar al-Assad’s government and has supported him throughout the uprising that began in March 2011.
The biggest current differences between the US and Russia, though, are over Ukraine.
In mid-October, Putin accused Obama of having a hostile attitude towards Russia, while Obama decried “Russian aggression in Europe” in a recent speech to the United Nations General Assembly.
Earlier today US deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters in Beijing: “We continue to be deeply troubled by Russian activities. If they continue… it’s a recipe for isolation.”
Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union’s last leader, reportedly warned at the weekend that the world was on the “brink of a new Cold War” at an event to mark 25 years since the Berlin Wall’s fall.
Heading into today’s meetings, Abbott had pledged to “shirtfront” Putin over the fate of Flight MH17, which came down in July with the loss of 298 lives, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.
“Shirtfront” is an Australian Rules Football term in which a player violently charges an opponent.
“The leaders have robustly spoken out in favour of speeding up the investigation of the reasons for the tragedy,” the Kremlin said after Putin and Abbott met today at the APEC summit.

MSCI shifting most of its operations to India

(Of 3,100 employees in 26…)
MUMBAI: MSCI, which runs market indices that global investors follow closely, is gradually shifting most of its operations to India. Having started with a small back office in Mumbai a decade ago, it recently bought about 1.2 lakh square feet of office space in a suburb of India's commercial hub.
Of 3,100 employees in 26 countries, a little over 700 are now located in MSCI's Mumbai office, which serves markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
"Currently, our office in Mumbai is the largest MSCI office worldwide, bigger than the corporate office. We now have every single function -- finance, sales, research, analytics, data management, technology and human recourses - present here," said Baer Pettit, managing director, MSCI, who was in the city to mark the company's 10 years in the country. The space acquired in Goregoan will accommodate around 1,100 people.
"If you look at the opportunities available in India and, on the margin front, if you look around the world, India will be the greatest destination compared to others," Pettit said. "In the year to date, our Indian business has grown fastest among 26 countries in which we are present.
About 43% of the India-focused global ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are benchmarked against MSCI indices."
MSCI is a provider of investment decision support tools to more than 6,000 clients worldwide, ranging from large pension plans to boutique hedge funds.
The perception that investing in emerging markets can carry a high degree of environmental, social, governance (ESG) and political risk has changed dramatically in the past few years because of the availability of much larger, liquid emerging market products, according to Pettit.
"Investors are looking at total global equity products rather than dividing (them) into emerging and developed market products," he said. "Investment in emerging markets is now more structural and permanent in nature rather than something that comes and goes." Pettit said India could benefit the most from emerging market allocations as the global perception on the country has changed with the announcement of various reforms by the Narendra Modi government. The reforms include diesel price deregulation, labour rule relaxations and others with more measures set to follow.
MSCI India has risen 22% so far this year against the 1% rise in the MSCI Emerging Market Index. The Sensex has risen 32% so far in 2014. The MSCI India index is tracked overseas with several passive funds allocating sums in line with the weight accorded to them in their portfolios. These funds buy or sell the stocks if the index weights are changed.
Pettit said ETFs are not as popular in India as they are overseas because individual investors are active in stock picking as they think they can beat the market. "We would love to see ETF market develop here," he said.

TCS sees surge in revenue from Tata Group cosTCS sees jump in revenue from Tata Group, close to its $1 billion target

(“They are getting more…)
MUMBAI: Tata Consultancy Services, the information technology unit of the Tata Group, is more than a quarter of the way to its goal of garnering $1 billion (more than Rs 6,150 crore) in revenue from the group's companies, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Cyrus Mistry, the group's chairman, had asked heads of Tata companies to begin shifting work to TCS two years ago. TCS used to receive about $100 million a year from Tata Group companies, less than a tenth of what the group companies are estimated to spend on information technology. But that has begun to change.
"They are getting more business from the group companies. I would say, that they would be close to $350 million a year from the group companies," an executive with a group company, who declined to be named, told ET. TCS said it doesn't provide client specific information. The company posted revenue of $13.4 billion in fiscal 2014.
TCS has also been winning back deals it had lost to global players such as International Business Machines. In 2012, the company won a $385 million deal from Tata Motors-owned British auto maker Jaguar Land Rover . It was the IT backbone for the Tata Group's joint venture with Starbucks and with Tata International's venture with fashion manufacturer Wolverine WorldWide. Revenue from these two deals could not be ascertained. TCS also counts Tata Teleservices , Tata Sky , Tata Capital and Infiniti Retail, that runs the group's electronics chain Croma, as clients, its annual report showed. In fact, Tata Sky, Tata Capital and Infiniti Retail increased their spending with the company in fiscal 2014.
"There is no doubt that they are getting more aggressive with the Tata Group companies. I would say about 25-30% of the IT work has moved or is in the process of moving to them," a source with knowledge of the group's IT spending said. While IT arms of large conglomerates could feel like the work is theirs for the taking, TCS still maintains that it has a long way to go to winning all of the Tata Group's IT expenditure.
"I think we have a small presence in the group; it's still small, even if that is the number ($350 million)," TCS chief executive N Chandrasekaran said in a recent interview. "The potential of the group is very high. We can still work with many group companies. The group can be a productive customer, but we have to work and compete like anybody else."
Experts who track IT spending in India say there is no issue with the Tata Group asking its group companies to use its IT arm. "TCS is one of the best IT companies in the world and they are doing well on their own as well. They win contracts competing against the best companies as it is," said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. "I don't see that there is anything wrong with the Tata Group wanting to move work to them. It makes sense."

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by nearly 99 points at 28,008.90 on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors despite weak global cues.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty ended higher by 20.65 points at 8,383.30.
Among BSE sectoral indices, auto and banking indices were the star-performers and were up 1.18 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.37 per cent, followed by metal 0.9 per cent, PSU 0.57 per cent and capital goods 0.53 per cent.
Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and ITC were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel, NTPC and L&T.
The benchmark BSE Sensex surged 203.97 points or 0.73 per cent to trade at a new record-high of 28,114.03 in the morning session, breaking its previous peak of 28,027.96 reached on November 10.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade and hit a new life-time high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-share NSE index crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points or 0.53 per cent to trade at a life-time high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said that the domestic sentiment remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed the trading sentiment, they added.
A report by Equentis Capital said: "We expect markets likely to remain positive. Stay cautious and book profits on higher levels. The government will unveil IIP data for September 2014 and annual rate of inflation based on the combined consumer price indices (CPI) for urban and rural India for October 2014 on 12 November 2014. Inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for October 2014 will be released on 14 November 2014. Slower inflation could support regulators (RBI) to increase liquidity in the market in short-term and positive action by the regulators will be good for interest sensitive sectors/stocks."
European stocks
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS , Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Asian shares
Asian stocks extended their gains for the fourth day as Japanese shares climbed after the yen depreciated to a seven-year low amid speculation the nation will delay raising its sales tax again.
Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Nikkei 225 rose 73 points or 0.43 per cent at 17,197 and Hang Seng jumped 184.08 points or 0.77 per cent at 23,992.36.

Internet helps citizens make smart choices: EricssonEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
In a report released today, Ericcson says Internet helps citizens to make smart and more informed choices.
The study, ‘Smart Citizens: How the internet facilitates smart choices in city life’, covers 9 cities worldwide — Beijing, Delhi, London, New York, Paris, Rome, Sao Paulo, Stockholm and Tokyo — and explores how as citizens become smarter, so do the cities they inhabit.
The report explores different concepts that will enable people to take a more proactive and participatory role in city life, from digital health monitoring to interactive road navigation and social bike and car sharing.
Michael Björn, Head of Research at Ericsson ConsumerLab, said “Citizens want current players to internet-enable their services. This means for example that city authorities are expected to provide ICT services related to traffic, public services and water quality.”
“Interestingly, for all the concepts tested, citizens who live in the central parts of cities are more interested in the concepts than those who live in suburbs. Also, the young and full time workers are those with the overall highest predicted daily use of the concepts, and the ones who will most actively push cities to grow smarter,” he added.
Looking at the city-specific findings, he says: “Delhi, Beijing and Sao Paulo score very high on usefulness ratings for all concepts we tested, whereas Paris, London and Stockholm score significantly lower. For example, only 41 percent in Stockholm, a city known for its great drinking water quality, find the water quality checker concept to be of use, compared to 92 percent for Delhi.”
This study was conducted online in September 2014 with 9,030 iPhone and Android smartphone users aged between 15 and 69. Respondents were from Beijing, Delhi, London, New York, Paris, Rome, Sao Paulo, Stockholm and Tokyo, representing 61 million citizens.

market and exchange
The rupee weakened by 10 paise to 61.60 against the dollar in early trade on Tuesday at the Interbank Foreign Exchange due to increased demand for the US currency from importers. Forex dealers attributed the rupee’s weakness to increased demand for the US currency from importers and its strength against some other currencies overseas but a higher opening in the domestic equity market limited the fall.
The rupee had gained 12 paise to close at 61.50 against the dollar in Monday’s trade on fresh selling of the US currency by banks and exporters on the back of strong capital inflows.

Maintain buy on BEL after strong margins & executionFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
We maintain ‘buy’ rating on Bharat Electronics (BEL) with a target price of R2,354 per share. The stock is trading at 15.6x FY16e earnings. We believe the opportunity for BEL is large given the increased focus of the new government on modernisation of current fleet and procurement of new capital equipments. We continue to believe BEL offers good investment opportunities to the investors who want to invest in the Indian defence sector with a long-term view.
BEL reported sales of R1,290 crore, up 24% y-o-y. Pick-up in supply to major projects like Akash Missile System, Passive Night Vision Devices ,Electronic Support Measure System, Low Level Light Weight Radar, Tactical Control Radar, Stabilised Optronic Pedestal, L-band Radar, Missile Warning System etc helped support healthy sales growth. The company reported ebitda of R110 crore. Gross margins improved by 230 bps to 43.1%, while other expenses were down 5% y-o-y to R140 crore. Other income was up only 1% y-o-y to R110 crore. Adjusted PAT was up 147% y-o-y to R140 crore. Major planned projects for execution in FY15 are Akash Missile, Low level light weight radar, 3D- Tactical control radar, Passive night vision devices, Missile warning systems, upgradation of Schika.
Order book at the end of Q2FY15 stood at R22,800 crore, down 8% y-o-y. The order inflow for the quarter stood at R820 crore down 19% y-o-y.

Rising Dollar Threatens Rupee  Will Test Rajan s Firepower: ReportRupee Ends Higher at 61.88 After RBI Policy Review
Raghuram Rajan has much to show for his year-long stint as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. The rupee is the best performing emerging market currency this year and his crusade against inflation is coming to fruition rather sooner-than-expected.
But Dr Rajan is likely to face his biggest test as Governor if the dollar continues to rise against a basket of currencies.
The dollar has gained over 7 per cent over the last four months, but the rupee has held on to the 58-62/dollar range because of the over 30 per cent fall (since late June) in crude prices and continued restrictions on gold imports. These two factors have led to a substantial drop in India's import bill and have supported the rupee.
Further strength in the dollar will make the rupee vulnerable because the Indian currency is more sensitive to a rising dollar than falling oil prices, say Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Indranil Sen Gupta and Abhishek Gupta.
"The INR has typically been unable to withstand this cross-currency pressure despite a favorable movement in Brent," the analysts said.
These economists say there is a "rising possibility" of a temporary breach of 62/dollar, but they expect the RBI to mount a "token defense" to support the rupee at this level because India's import cover has remained low at around 8 months.
They also say that, "Governor Rajan will not want to take chances with INR expectations beyond Rs65/dollar." The investment bank expects the RBI to sell up to $20 billion (Rs 1.20 lakh crore) to defend a breach of 65/dollar, if that happens.
That's because the rupee has tended to fall below the previous low in each successive rounds of volatility. It dropped to 53/dollar during the end-2011 European crisis, extended its fall to 57/dollar during the 2012 Greek crisis and collapsed to 68/dollar during the taper tantrum of 2013.
A Reuters poll predicts the rupee at 61.70 per dollar in six months and 62.36 per dollar in a year, but these predictions are more bearish than forecasts in the October survey and come despite the stock market rallying 32 per cent since the start of this year on robust capital inflows.

Venus Remedies Gets Nod to Market Generic Antibiotic in Switzerland
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 11, 2014 22:57 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Drug firm Venus Remedies has received approval from the Swiss drug authority - Swissmedic - to market in the country its generic injectable antibiotic meropenem used for treating infections.
Venus Remedies in a statement said it has received marketing authorisation from the drug authority through its German arm Venus Pharma GmbH for meropenem 500 mg and 1 g injections.
"With plans to launch this product early next year through our partner Swiss Pharma GmbH Zurich, we will be able to capture 10 per cent share in the meropenem market of Switzerland," Venus Remedies chairman and managing director Pawan Chaudhary said.
Being among the first few companies to receive marketing authorisation from Switzerland for this drug, Venus enjoys a distinct advantage, the company said.
Meropenem is a last-resort drug of the carbapenem class of antibiotics used in intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals, it added.
"The global annual sale of meropenem, which stood at $1,879 million in 2012, is estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.5 per cent to reach around $2,100 million in 2014-15," Venus Remedies said.
The drug is used in the treatment of severe bacterial infections like pneumonia, broncho-pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis, complicated urinary tract infections among others.
The company has secured more than 40 marketing authorisations for meropenem throughout the world from countries like the UK, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Italy, among others, Venus Remedies said.

Tribunal Clubs K P Singh  Others  Petitions With Main DLF CaseBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has bundled the petitions from DLF promoter-chairman K P Singh and four others with the main petition that the realty major has filed with the quasi-judicial body on October 22 and put off the hearing on the matter to December 10.
DLF chairman K P Singh, his son and vice-chairman Rajiv Singh, younger daughter and whole-time director Pia Singh, company directors T C Goyal and Ramesh Sanka had earlier moved the tribunal challenging an October 10 ban on them by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The regulator had banned the company and six of its senior officials including the chairman from accessing the capital markets for three years for alleged non-disclosure of three of its hundreds of subsidiaries in a 2007 IPO filing.
Admitting their petitions, the quasi-judicial body (SAT) directed Sebi to submit respond to these new bunch of petitions on December 6 and directed the petitioners to file their rejoinders on the 8th, and fixed December 10 for hearing on their petitions along with the main case.
On November 5, the tribunal had allowed DLF to redeem Rs 1,806 crore from its mutual fund investments to meets its working capital requirement and to service its debt, till December 31.
DLF had sought permission to redeem money locked in MFs after being slapped with the three-year ban by Sebi.
The final hearing in DLF's main appeal against the order would commence on December 10, prior to which Sebi and the company will have to file their replies with SAT.
As an interim measure, SAT has allowed the company to redeem mutual funds worth Rs 767 crore in November and further funds worth Rs 1,039 crore in December.
"Sebi order did not ban DLF from continuing its business, but only barred it from accessing the capital markets for three years," a three-member SAT bench said explaining the rationale for the interim relief.
"It can be reasonably concluded that the appellant (DLF) should be allowed to use its own funds to meet its every day needs and other working capital requirements, including meeting its obligations to the creditors."
"Accordingly, this tribunal justifies the appellant's demand to redeem Rs 1,806 crore from MFs and also allow its lenders to de-freeze/invoke pledged shares of its subsidiaries as and when required," Presiding Officer JP Devadhar had said.
The tribunal had also noted that Sebi counsel Rafique Dada did not object to the interim relief.
"We are not opposing the plea for interim relief presuming that the tribunal is satisfied with the case made out by the appellant and not that we agree with all the points made," Mr Dada said.
Sebi took action against DLF for "active and deliberate suppression" of material information at the time of 2007 IPO, which fetched it Rs 9,187 crore, the biggest IPO at that time.

Abhishek Singhvi case: BJP raises black money issue; asks Sonia Gandhi to clarifyLetters to  the editor
BJP today accused Congress leaders of generating black money in the country while referring to the matter of the alleged tax evasion by its spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi and asked Congress President Sonia Gandhi to clarify on the issue.
“The issue of Singhvi is just a sample as it is only what has come out in the public domain. How many Congress leaders are turning black money into white?
“Congress has created a lot of black money during the last 10 years of its government, which saw a lot of corruption and scams. Congress President Sonia Gandhi should clarify,” said BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma.
Terming the matter “a classic case of tax evasion”, BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “This is a classic case of how black money is produced within the country by the tall leaders of Congress.”
Attacking the Congress, he said, “It sermonises on black money and this is what is happening in its own house. You are producing black money in your own house and are evading taxes. The Congress has a lot to answer for.
“Either you (Congress) own up that your tall leaders are evading taxes and indulging in generation of black money or you disown Singhvi.”
Sharma accused the Congress of being the “fountainhead of corruption” and said this is the reason why its MPs did not give an undertaking on black money in Parliament whereas all the BJP legislators had done so.
“This is only the tip of the iceberg. The country is well aware of the fact that many tall leaders of Congress have stashed black money not only abroad but also at home. Law will surely take its course but will Congress punish Singhvi?” Patra said.
Citing details of revelations by the Income Tax Settlement Commission, Patra said there has been a substantial increase in Singhvi’s income and, in a short span of time between Jan. 15, 2011, to March 31, 2011, there was a considerable jump in payments for his legal assistance.
“In this short span of about two-and-a-half months, about 18,199 vouchers were signed by Singhvi. On a single day, March 31, 2011, about 1,207 vouchers were signed. All these are self -made vouchers. No authentic bills were procured,” Patra said.

ASEAN Summit: PM Narendra Modi s Look East policy at playNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting that begins on Wednesday holds special significance in the context of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stated ‘Link West, Look East’ policy.
While India has been following the Look-East policy since 1990, it became a sectoral dialogue partner with ASEAN in 1992 and a full dialogue partner in 1996. However, it is only since 2002 that India has had a Summit-level partnership with the grouping.
The ASEAN-India functional cooperation includes cooperation across sectors such as trade, science & technology, human resource development, agriculture, energy, IT, telecom, transport and infrastructure, tourism and culture.
The ASEAN-India Trade-in-Goods Agreement was signed in August 2009 and that in services & investment was signed earlier this year.
India’s export in 2013-14 to the 10 nations that are part of ASEAN amounts to $33.1 billion or 10.5 per cent of its total exports, which is more than the exports to the African nations or to the Latin American countries.
Import from ASEAN nations, however, at $42.86 billion, is 9.17 per cent of the total imports by India and is higher than the inflow from Africa, Latin America or North America.
India’s Priorities at the Meeting:
ACT EAST POLICY
India aims to build economic and strategic relations with ASEAN countries
BETTER CONNECTIVITY
India may pitch for improved connectivity links with ASEAN and East Asian countries. The country is keen that the next
ASEAN-India five-year plan of action, starting 2016, should also focus on security architecture in the region and there could be progress on a project to develop a 3,200 km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand. While it was envisaged to be completed by end of 2017, it is now expected to be completed in 2018
MORE TRADE
Modi will also hold talks to enhance trade between India and ASEAN nations who have recently signed the free trade pact
TOURISM:
India is keen to tap the potential offered by the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit to attract more tourists from South East Asian nations
MODI: “Do keep sharing thoughts & ideas for the visit. Here is a great place to keep updated on the visit…”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked people in a tweet, as he kicked off his 11-day three-nation tour. Modi will attend the 12th ASEAN-India summit and the 9th East Asian summit in Myanmar. He will later visit Australia for a G-20 meet followed by Fiji.

Snapdeal  Amazon  no match  for Alibaba | Amazon plans it big with India PostAlibaba Group
(The two companies were still…)
BENGALURU | NEW DELHI: Twenty minutes was all it took for Alibaba to clock its first $1 billion (Rs 6,100 crore) in sales during China's biggest online shopping event, the 'Singles Day Sale,' on Tuesday.
Alibaba Group had crossed $7.7 billion (over Rs 47,000 crore) in sales by 8 pm Beijing time, a full $1.7 billion (over Rs 10,400 crore) more than the estimated size India's online retail industry will reach in 2015, according to research firm Gartner.
Snapdeal and Amazon, in India, also had their own sales on Tuesday, maybe hoping that some of the Singles Day — it is China's version of Valentine's Day — magic will rub off on them. Snapdeal's Savings Day sale featured hourly deals and steep discounts across categories. Amazon India restricted its sale to users of its mobile application in an attempt to increase app downloads. Shoppers on the app had offers like a chance to win 11 months of free shopping of products worth Rs 11,000 per month.
The two companies were still collating data on how much they had sold until the time of going to press and hence declined to share sales figures with ET.
But price comparison and couponing portals registered an uptick in traffic to Snapdeal. Consumer traffic to Snapdeal through cashback and couponing site CashKaro was seven times higher compared to regular days by 3 pm. Conversion of clicks from the site to transactions on Snapdeal was about 25% higher than normal. Price comparison portal MySmartPrice, which typically gets traffic of six lakh a day, saw a 200% increase in click-through traffic to Snapdeal, until 4 pm when the data was collected, as compared to the pre-Diwali sales on October 6 when Snapdeal sold goods worth Rs 600 crore.
The two portals denied that they chose the date keeping in mind China's Singles Day, a day of massive online sales organised by Alibaba for the first time in 2009.
Since then other Chinese sites have also organised sales on the same date every year. "We wanted to create a special day for the app and reward our app users. We chose 11/11 due to the unique nature of the date," said an Amazon India spokesperson. The sales events organised by Snapdeal and Amazon India on Tuesday were much more low-key compared to the Singles Day sales organised by their Chinese counterparts. A chunk of customer buzz that was generated was negative.
Snapdeal's social media feed on Tiwtter and Facebook were filled primarily with rants and complaints from customers. "Whenever I click on any products it says "The product is not available"...and it takes like ever to checkout and pay for a product," said Parthiban Annadurai on Facebook. These issues proved helpful for competitors. "We witnessed an incremental shift of over 25% to other e-commerce portals among shoppers, mainly between 7 am and 9 am, and 11 am and 12 noon on tuesday," said Rohan Bhargava, co-founder of CashKaro. But industry watchers said it is unfair to compare the performance of Indian sites with their older Chinese counterparts.
N Chandramouli, CEO at Trust Research Advisory, said Snapdeal has in fact been smart about the sales.

Police want Kiran Bedi case closed  CM door may openComments
The Delhi Police crime branch has filed a closure report in a cheating case against Kiran Bedi. The development, coming as it does in the run-up to assembly elections, has triggered speculation of the former IPS officer joining the BJP.

Bedi, previously associated with AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, has voiced her support for the Narendra Modi government on Twitter and lauded his Swachh Bharat campaign. Before the December 2013 polls, a section of the BJP was said to be keen on making her the chief ministerial candidate.
The case against Bedi was filed in November 2011 when the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement, of which she was a part, was at its peak. She was accused of misusing funds donated by Microsoft to her trusts, India Vision Foundation and Navjyoti Foundation. She was also accused of buying computers for Rs. 50,000 each against an actual price of `20,000 when she was principal of the Police Training College. A city court then had ordered the registration of an FIR against her on charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy.
In the closure report, submitted to the court on October 28, the police have taken statements from Microsoft denying any embezzlement of funds by Bedi, sources said.
The investigating officer has also submitted a copy of audit reports from the Police Training College. These reports, the police said, state that all purchases were cleared and were aboveboard.   The closure report comes up in court later this month.
Contacted by HT, Bedi said Tuesday she wasn’t aware of the closure report but “glad to hear about it”. She added, “It was a matter of time for the report to be filed. No way did this case disturb me. I knew it had no substance.”

BJP  Congress now fight over claim to Nehru legacyBJP, Cong fight over claim to Nehru legacy
Saubhadra Chatterji , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 11, 2014
First Published: 20:01 IST(11/11/2014) | Last Updated: 09:56 IST(12/11/2014)
Comments
The tussle between the BJP and the Congress over appropriation of legacy of national icons has intensified. This time, over Jawaharlal Nehru.
Both the Congress and the BJP-led NDA government have laid elaborate plans to celebrate Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary. But the Congress, which invited several world leaders for seminars on Nehru, did not send any invite to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“We have not given any invitation to the PM. We have invited all those who truly believe in democracy and the ideals of Nehru,” a defiant Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said.
Ironically, the Congress highlighted BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s praise on Nehru. “We are acknowledging all those who have said something meaningful. As a political party, we have our freedom to decide who subscribes to Nehru’s views,” he added.
The latest friction comes close on the heels of the tug-of-war between the BJP-led ruling establishment and the Congress over Sardar Vallavbhai Patel’s birthday celebrations on October 31. The Congress angrily alleged that the BJP had ignored late PM Indira Gandhi’s martyrdom day.
As the PM is abroad, home minister Rajnath Singh will kick-start the 125th anniversary from Nehru’s birthday, November 14. The Congress, cautious to avoid their celebrations with the government blitzkrieg, has advanced the commencement of their celebrations by a day. The party justified the preemptive move saying it would enable the state units to undertake their own programmes on November 14.
While the Congress will focus on invoking Nehru’s legacy, the government has added its pet agenda of cleanliness to the celebrations to give its own imprint.
PM Modi, who took charge of the panel to celebrate Nehru’s birth anniversary after assuming power at the centre, wants “Bal Swachhta Mission” to be organized at schools November 14-19. He also suggested celebrating the 125th anniversary of Nehru as the “year of Bal Swachhta”.
The plan to add cleanliness mission can also give the government an edge over the Congress’ celebrations of its own icon. “The Bal Swachhta Mission would certainly add a new level of relevance to Nehru’s legacy,” said an Opposition leader.

Chhattisgarh sterilisation camp toll climbs to 11Eleven women have died and dozens more are in a critical condition after a government-run sterilisation programme in Chhattisgarh designed to control the country's billion-plus population went wrong, officials said on Tuesday.
 
More than 50 women are seriously ill after suffering complications from the surgery in Bilaspur district over the weekend, authorities in Chhattisgarh said.
 
"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district.
 
They were among 83 women who had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation as part of an annual family planning camp on Saturday. They were sterilised in the operation theatre of a private hospital, which was not yet fully functional. The operation theatre had not been used for the past four months.
 
The women had undergone surgery in just five hours at the camp in Takhatpur area of Bilaspur. After the women started complaining of severe pain, they were referred to the Bilaspur district hospital.
 
Health officials denied any negligence, but some said too many surgeries were perfomed in one day to meet targets.
 
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths and a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.

"It's a very unfortunate incident. Prime facie it appears that incident occurred due to negligence (by doctors). A detailed enquiry will be conducted into it keeping in view all the angles, including the quality of the medicines at the camp, standard of the surgery, post operatives measures and others," Singh said.
The Union ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a committee to probe the sterilisation deaths.
“The ministry has asked for report and constituted a committee to investigate the matter. Action will be taken after the report is submitted,” said Shripad Naik, minister of state for health.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the deaths and asked the chief minister to ensure a thorough investigation and take action.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had also demanded “strict action” against the guilty.
State governments frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as an incentive to undergo the procedure.
 
Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible. The opposition Congress party held massive demonstration in the state capital and Bilaspur town demanding the resignation of the health minister and called for Chhattisgarh bandh on Wednesday. 
 
The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. Bilaspur is the home district of the Chhattisgarh health minister
 
"It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the women admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."
 
The deaths bring back into focus the long-running, contentious state-run programme that contributed to the defeat of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977. Her worst defeats came in areas where the family planning campaign was robustly implemented by her son, Sanjay.
 
Deaths due to sterilisation are not a new problem in India, where some 4.6 million sterilisations were performed in 2013-14, government figures show. Many die as a result of botched surgeries, while others are left bleeding and in agony.
 
Government figures show 1,434 sterilisation deaths between 2003 and 2012, with 2009 being the worst year with a maximum of 247 deaths. On an average, 12 deaths occurred every month over the last 10 years.

Many a times parents overlook other goals as they are too busy focusing on just one goal, that is on their child's education. They are too emotionally involved in achieving this particular goal that they forget planning for their retirement and saving for other emergencies.

Will welcome support from anyone  except Cong.: BJPpolitical development
As its government braces for a trust vote in Maharashtra on Wednesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday said it welcomes support of all parties except Congress for development of the state.
The BJP will welcome support of all parties except Congress, which is “responsible for the mess”, so that the government can work for development of Maharashtra and fulfil the aspirations of its people, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
The remark by Mr. Rudy, who was in-charge of Maharashtra affairs of BJP till recently, indicated that the BJP was not averse to receiving support of all non-Congress parties in the state, including the NCP.
“Those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra should come. We want to take along all those who want to come forward for the development of Maharashtra. I hope Shiv Sena will turn around,” he said.
Asked about Sharad Pawar’s NCP, he said that party has already extended unconditional support but dismissed suggestions that they will be running the show in the state.
On a query whether Union Minister Anant Geete will soon resign and Shiv Sena will sit in opposition in Maharashtra, he said he was not aware of it.
“Even prior to elections, we wanted to take Shiv Sena along and post-elections also, wanted it to be part of the government,” he said.
The remarks were significant as Shiv Sena gave conflicting signals of sitting in the Opposition in the state Assembly while appearing open to conciliatory talks.
Mr. Rudy was speaking after taking over as Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs along with Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in Parliament House on Tuesday in the presence of Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu.
In a sudden move on Monday, a day after its chief Uddhav Thackeray served an ultimatum to BJP to come clear within two days on the issue of taking NCP’s support for survival of its government, Sena submitted a letter to the Assembly Secretary asking him to accord its Legislature Party leader Eknath Shinde Leader of Opposition status.
Hours later, however, Uddhav said the decision to stake claim to LoP’s post was taken because Congress wanted the position on the ground that Sena was part of the BJP-led NDA and, if that were to happen, “we would have been left nowhere“.
After BJP and Sena, Congress is the third largest party in the Assembly with 42 MLAs.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the Assembly with effective strength of 287, still 24 short of a majority. With the help of 7 independents and few others from smaller parties, it can reduce the gap but cannot bridge it completely.
41-member NCP holds key to the survival of the Devendra Fadnavis government. With the 63-member Shiv Sena deciding to sit in the opposition , the minority Fadnavis dispensation can win the trust vote with the help of either active voting by NCP or through abstention.

One in 3 Indian youth cyberbullied due to risky online behaviour: McAfee reportEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
McAfee, part of Intel Security, has  released findings of its annual study, the Tweens, Teens and Technology 2014 report, which examines the online behaviour and social networking habits of Indian tweens and teens, and aims to educate on the impact that risky behaviour has on their privacy, reputation and social media experiences.
According to the research, half (50%) of the youth in India have had some experience with cyber-bullying (been cyberbullied online or witnessed others being cyberbullied), out of which one-third (36%) have been cyberbullied themselves. This behaviour was perceived to result in anger and embarrassment, showcasing how online behaviour translates into offline impact.
“Teens and tweens are very comfortable operating in the online world, yet the risks have never been greater. Young people are often the pioneers for new technologies so they need to understand the consequences of their online behaviour and how they can maintain their social engagement,” said Melanie Duca, APAC Consumer Marketing Director, McAfee, part of Intel Security
The study highlights how risky online activity can possibly make them even more susceptible to cyberbullying, substantiated through some of the following statistics.
 
Need to be constantly connected
An eye-opening trend is that half (52%) of India’s youth even access their social media accounts while at school, with tweens (57%) being more connected during school hours than teens (47%). Even though the minimum age to register to on social networking sites like Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest, Tinder, Tumblr, and Vine is 13, 10-12 year olds report higher daily access to than their teen counterparts.
Oversharing of risky information
Despite a majority (80%) of Indian youth being aware that their online activity can affect their identity, 92% have done or posted something risky online. An added fact is that of these, 70% have posted their contact details like email, phone and home address.
Youth are increasingly trusting unknown people in the virtual world, in spite of being aware that it is risky. 53% have met someone in person that they first met online. 63% of youth do not turn off their location or GPS services across apps, leaving their locations visible to strangers.
Finding Social Acceptance
Another critical concern stemming from peer pressure is youth feeling compelled to portray an untrue image of themselves online. 64% even admit to trying  to reinvent their online personas making themselves appear older, creating fake profiles or posting photos that are not their own. Moreover, 46% say they would put themselves in danger to see more engagement/ activity on their posts (e.g., more likes, comments, shares or retweets).
Lack of parental involvement
Only 46% say their parents have had a conversation with them about online safety. Others say their parents simply don’t care (52%).
Top 5 Tips for Parents to Help Educate Their Kids:
1. Connect with your kids. Casually talk to them about the risks of all online connections and make sure the communication lines are open.
2. Gain access. Have passwords for your children’s social media accounts and passcodes to their children’s devices to have full access at any given moment.
3. Learn their technology. Stay one step ahead and take the time to research the various devices your kids use. You want to know more about their devices than they do.
4. Get social. Stay knowledgeable about the newest and latest social networks. You don’t have to create an account but it is important to understand how they work and if your kids are on them.
5. Reputation management. Make sure your kids are aware anything they post online does not have an expiration date.

AAI  Pawan Hans to be listed; Air India privatisation not nowAAI, Pawan Hans to be listed; Air India privatisation not now
PTI   New Delhi, November 10, 2014
First Published: 15:27 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 15:34 IST(10/11/2014)
State-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and national helicopter company Pawan Hans will be listed on the stock exchanges to improve transparency and efficiency, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said on Monday.
   
The minister also said that privatisation of national carrier Air India will not happen immediately, but cannot be ruled out in future and there have been suggestions from various quarters in this regard.
   
Proposals for listing of AAI and Pawan Hans have been made in the Draft Civil Aviation Policy, released by Raju in Delhi.
   
Raju said that an expert committee will be constituted to develop the future roadmap for Air India.
   
"It is essential to ensure that the national carrier achieves its full potential," the minister said, while adding that a Mission Mode project will also be set up to ensure that all organisations under the ministry are competitive in terms of cost and efficiency.
   
"AAI will be corporatised followed by its listing on the stock exchanges to improve efficiency and transparency," Raju said, adding that listing of Pawan Hans would also be undertaken with the same objective.
   
AAI, a Miniratna Public Sector Enterprise, manages 125 airports across the country, including 11 International, 81 domestic and eight Customs Airports. It also manages 25 Civil Enclaves at Defence Airfields.
   
It has entered into Joint Ventures at Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Nagpur Airports to upgrade them.
   
AAI also provides Air Traffic Management Services over entire Indian Air Space and adjoining oceanic areas with ground installations at airports and other locations.
    
Pawan Hans Ltd was incorporated in 1985 and presently its shareholding comprises 51% with the Government of India and 49% with state-run ONGC.
    
It was incorporated with the primary objective of providing helicopter support services to the oil sector for its off-shore exploration operations, services in remote and hilly areas and charter services for promotion of tourism.
    
Over the years, it has grown into one of Asia's largest helicopter company and has a fleet of 47 helicopters.

Not Obama or Putin  but Modi most sought-after leaderBarack Obama
(While Modi is expected to…)
NEW DELHI: It is not Barack Obama or Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping or Shinzo Abe or Angela Merkel - leaders of the five most powerful countries of the world - who are most sought after at the East Asia and G-20 Summits. Instead it is Narendra Modi , elected to the high office only six months back, who has received maximum requests for bilateral meetings from his counterparts and heads of state on the sidelines of East Asia, ASEAN and G-20 Summits in Myanmar and Australia later this week.
South Block officials told ET that several slots have been reserved for Modi's bilateral interactions on the sidelines of the Summits in both Nay Pyi Taw and Brisbane following requests from several leaders who have expressed interest to meet the Indian PM. "As some of the leaders are common in East Asia Summit and G20, the schedule for Modi's meetings are being worked out depending on the itinerary of his counterparts," an official informed.
This is Modi's first outing in both East Asia and G20 Summit and understandably there's interest among other leaders to interact with him, sources claimed. "The interest is also due to the fact that these countries want to step up economic engagement with India and they sense an opportunity under the Modi government to increase trade and investments," an official indicated.
While Modi is expected to meet some leaders like Obama, Abe, Dilma Rouseff whom he had already met and Putin who is travelling to Delhi in December, the emphasis is on meeting leaders such as German Chancellor Merkel and former British PM Gordon Brown (in Brisbane) whom the PM has not met yet, sources indicated.
Besides, Modi could meet leaders of France, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina and Nigeria in Brisbane on the sidelines of the G20 meet. Meeting with the Canadian PM, South Korean President and European Union leaders are also on the cards.
The bilateral meet with host Myanmarese President Thein Sein is expected on Tuesday after Modi's arrival in Nay Pyi Taw. This will be the second visit by an Indian PM to Myanmar in one calendar year after Manmohan Singh was there last March for the BIMSTEC Summit. India has undertaken a slew of connectivity, capacity building and development projects in Myanmar.

Will highlight  key  issue of cooperation against black money at G20: ModiAbbott
("A key issue for me would…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the importance of global cooperation against black money will be a "key issue" he will highlight at the upcoming G20 summit in Brisbane, as he embarks on a three-nation visit from tomorrow.
Seeking to inject momentum in the country's 'Act East' policy, Modi will undertake the 10-day visit of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji to attend key multilateral summits and undertake bilateral meetings during which India is expected to push for steps to create more jobs and improve world economy.
"A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money," Modi said in a pre-departure statement.
As India attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad, Modi is expected to renew the country's commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
In the statement, Modi said during the course of the ASEAN-India and East Asian summits in Myanmar Capital Nay Pyi and at the G20 summit in Brisbane and bilateral visits to Australia and Fiji he will meet over 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Pacific Region.
At the annual summit of the Group of 20 of the world's biggest developed and emerging economies, Modi said he intends to dicuss how it can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure, and ensure access to clean and affordable energy. The two-day summit will be held from November 15. G20 accounts for 85 per cent of the world's economic output.
During his foreign tour, Modi will undertake a bilateral visit for talks with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott in Canberra after the G20 summit.
Modi will be the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.
"While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential.
A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India's economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood," he said referring to his four-city, three-day visit from November 16 that covers Melbourne and Sydney besides Melbourne and Canberra.

G20 Brisbane summit: What Australia expects from India(Over our year as G20 president,…)
By Patrick Suckling
With days to go until the G20 Summit in Brisbane, member economies are striving towards a target that could deliver $2 trillion to the global GDP and generate millions of additional jobs, improving the quality of life for their people and communities. That goal is within reach.
Over our year as G20 president, Australia has been urging member economies to boost collective growth by more than 2% above 'business as usual' by 2018. If achieved, it would deliver significant economic dividends. G20 member economies have taken this ambition on board and genuine measures have been put forward by all partners. Here in India, reform for growth has always been at the centre of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda.
With over 900 measures on the table, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimate that we are now about 90% of the way to meeting our collective ambition. A key theme running through these measures is unleashing the private sector to do what it does best: strengthening growth and generating jobs. This is the best source of generating real, sustainable wealth for the world.
Australia and India agree that infrastructure investment is a crucial part of lifting growth. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors have agreed on a Global Infrastructure Initiative (GII) to help drive quality infrastructure investment right across the G20 and beyond. This will accelerate growth, create jobs and lead to productivity gains.
This initiative includes collective measures which will facilitate greater knowledge-sharing, help to address key data gaps, implement voluntary G20 leading practices on promoting and prioritising quality investment, and create a consolidated database of infrastructure projects to help match potential investors with projects. The GII will be designed to complement the work of international development banks and the initiatives in member countries, such as India's recently-announced 'PPP (Public-Private Partnership) in India'. A mechanism to implement specific elements of the GII will be announced in Brisbane.
G20 members are also focussed on building the resilience of the global economy and ensuring the circumstances that led to the global financial crisis are not repeated.
Finance ministers and central bank governors have made substantial progress to strengthen financial institutions and foster global stability, including increased recognition that the actions of any one country can have significant impacts on many others across the global economy. They agreed that the focus of the financial regulation agenda will now shift towards implementation of the reforms and ongoing monitoring to identify new risks.
Australia and India agree that the international tax system needs to keep pace with technology and changing business practices. Companies should pay tax in the country where they earn a profit. The G20 is on track to deliver on its two-year work plan to address tax avoidance. The finance ministers and central bank governors also agreed a rapid implementation plan for the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities to help to identify and catch tax-evaders by 2017 or end-2018.
  India is at the forefront of these efforts as an early implementer of the exchange protocols. This is substantial progress, but we are facing an increasingly difficult global economic situation that threatens to undermine our gains. The IMF has revised its global forecast for 2014 down again, and WTO economists have lowered their forecasts sharply. They now expect global trade volumes to grow just 3.1% this year, down from the 4.7% they predicted earlier in the year.
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has also told us that 2013 global employment was 62 million jobs lower than it would have been had pre-crisis trends in output and employment continued. While the challenge is now greater, it has only strengthened our resolve. Through the 2% target, we're striving to create an environment that is conducive to growth, because stronger economic growth is the key to addressing almost every global problem. This means removing impediments to private sector growth, enabling free trade, and lifting participation and employment, particularly of women and young people.
The G20 is the right body to steer the global economy back on the path to strong, sustainable and balanced economic growth. With its membership covering over 85% of the world economy, its actions reverberate in every corner of the globe. Achieving the G20's growth target is critical not only for the G20, but also to put the world's economy firmly back on track after the global financial crisis.

PM Modi eyes 8% growth  govt set for big reformsArun Jaitley
(The administration is well-placed…)
NEW DELHI: Having just completed a comprehensive round of ministerial and bureaucratic changes, the Narendra Modi government is set to embark on a series of economic reforms aimed at putting the country on track for 8% growth in the intermediate term and an even faster pace beyond that.
This will include ironing out the kinks in land acquisition, implementing the longawaited goods & services tax (GST), rapidly modernising the railway system to its fullest potential and fixing the seriously flawed agricultural produce marketing system. And where it sees the need for drastic, immediate change, the government won't be averse to taking the ordinance route, particularly with respect to the land acquisition law, seen as one of the biggest stumbling blocks to infrastructure development in the country.
The administration is well-placed to kick off its programme in the winter session of Parliament, when key economic Bills are expected to be introduced.
"Plate is full... focus areas are clear," said a senior government official. "All energies of the government will be directed towards this." A two-pronged approach to the reforms process will be followed — focusing on pushing key legislation and removing obstacles to procedures on the ground to improve governance, thereby lifting the curbs on growth and attracting greater levels of investment.
The government believed previously that changes in rules could help fix the shortcomings of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, that was moved by the UPA government, but it now believes an amendment will be needed. The law has stalled land acquisition because of the cumbersome procedures prescribed. The states have widely opposed it and the government is counting on that to get amendments passed in the Rajya Sabha, where it doesn't have a majority. In case this proves difficult, the government may move an ordinance.
With Finance Minister Arun Jaitley shouldering a lighter administrative load after the reshuffle, negotiations on GST and talks with the Opposition on passing the insurance Bill to raise the foreign direct investment cap to 49% in the winter session will gather pace.
The government has already undertaken some big-ticket measures in the form of diesel price deregulation and an ordinance to sort out coal allocation. It is also expected to bite the bullet on rationalising other subsidies, including fertiliser, LPG and food, at the opportune time. The coal sector is expected to get a shakeup with a set of measures lined up.
Reforms in marketing and handling of farm produce through restructuring of the Food Corporation of India and changes in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act are expected to get a renewed push. In the light of court orders pertaining to coal mines and telecom spectrum, a cleanup of the allocation of natural resources by putting in place an e-auction system is being contemplated.
Road and railway projects are ready to be picked up by investors, which should help connect rural areas. This will also tie into the Digital India project to make sure more Indians get access to the Internet. People involved in the railway plan say the government is talking to unions to take them on board before selectively bringing in the private sector in areas such as running premium high-profit trains that can cross-subsidise general travel. The emphasis on rail has another dimension — its people connect.
Better trains, cleaner stations and baggage-handling facilities are in for special attention. Unlike other sectors, railways can absorb a great deal of investment without running into land or environment issues. On Sunday, Modi appointed trusted associate Suresh Prabhu as railway minister, seen as a statement of intent that it's of high priority for the prime minister .
"A lot is happening and the effect would be visible only in some time," said a senior government official. Economists said several steps are on the anvil but the effects will take a while to percolate through. "A number of things are happening and all of them will result in increase in efficiency in the economy. But how much quantum will this add to growth is difficult to say," said DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.
Handpicked officials have been placed in key ministries and the new ministers there could be much more visible than before. "Policy paralysis has been arrested," Joshi said. "They seem to be on the right track... From now till next budget we should watch for some big-ticket moves." Overall business sentiment that had soured in the past three years has turned around with the new government at the helm but investments are yet to pick up. Growth expanded by 5.7% in the April-June quarter, the fastest in two years, but revival is yet to take definitive hold.

Restricting loan defaults: Wilful defaulters may face trial in 30 days30 days
(It'd happen if proposal…)
NEW DELHI: Those accused of wilful default face the prospect of being put on trial within 30 days of a bank determining that a borrower was not paying despite being able to, if a proposal being considered by a committee set up by the government to deal with high value loan defaults finds its way into the statute books.
The finance ministry had set up a committee to suggest measures to deal with wilful defaulters. VK Bhasin, former secretary in the law ministry's legal department, is the advisor to the committee. "Some suggestions include, 'summary trials,' in such cases.
The recommendations are being examined," said a person aware of the deliberations.Summary trial is essentially a fast track proceeding where a case is resolved in one or two sittings.
However, no sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding three months can be passed in a summary trial.
"These are meant to act as deterrent, and in cases where more action needs to be taken, regular trial procedure can be followed," said a finance ministry official, adding that the recommendations are still being debated.
The number of wilful default cases at state run banks has risen to 1311 at the end of December 2013 from 854 at the end of March 2011.
State-run lenders are attempting to declare Kingfisher Airlines and its promoter Vijay Mallya as wilful defaulters. Kingfisher Airlines owes about Rs4,022 crore to a consortium of 17 lenders. Mallya has chllened the move to declare him a willful defaulter in court.
Summary trials are dealt with under section 260 - 265 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
Wiflul defaulters lose access to capital markets and cannot access more loans from a bank or financial institution as per current regulations. The lenders can also initate criminal proceedings against willful defaulters, but there is no legal backing for speedy recovery of dues.
The committee, which also had representation from Indian Banks' Association (IBA), Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and RBI is also examining suggestions to amend the Sarfaesi Act, an act under which banks can seize assets of borrowers, and RDDB Act (Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions). In his budget speech , finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced setting up of six new debt recovery tribunals and said that government will come up with effective measure for revival of stressed assets.
There are over 40,000 cases worth Rs 1.73 lakh crore pending before various courts and debt recovery tribunals."If these summary trials can include the large corporate defaulters then only there will be some impact," said an executive director with a state run bank. The top 30 non-performing accounts of state run banks account for 40.2 % of their gross bad loans.Experts believe that wilful defaulters will not be deterred unless the judicial machinery to deal with it is specialized and the trial of offences are expeditious.

Why women dominate Google India s Rajan s portfolioWhy women entrepreneurs dominate Google India head Rajan Anandan's portfolio in 2014
Shelley Singh, ET Bureau Nov 11, 2014, 03.23AM IST

(Women account for 6 of 10…)
When she went looking for funds to give flight to her considerable ambitions, being all of 21 years of age and a woman should have been, in the orthodox construct that is the world of Indian investing, a disadvantage for Prukalpa Sankar. In a backhanded way, in the same orthodox construct, it turned out to be an advantage. "I was too young. The investors didn't ask about my marriage plans," laughs Sankar, recounting those times two years on. What they asked in great detail was about her business plans, which is what Sankar, like every other woman entrepreneur, wanted them to.
Sankar, a chemical and bio-molecular engineer, founder SocialCops, along with her friend Varun Banka. SocialCops is a technology company that uses crowd-sourced data to answer questions like what is the safest route to go home or where are the accident hotspots in a city.
In the coming years, it wants to do number enumeration exercises on the scale of the Indian census, in real time as opposed to the decadal frequency of the government's exercise. SocialCops has raised Rs 2 crore from Google India managing director Rajan Anandan, 500 Startups and Manoj Menon, managing director of Frost & Sullivan.
The first name in that list of investors is conscious of women entrepreneurs like Sankar, not so much about them being in a minority, but more about how their footprints are increasing on the Indian startup landscape. Anandan, a prolific angel investor, points to how his personal portfolio of startup investments has changed over the years.
Anandan began making such investments, mostly in partnership with other investors, in 2006. In the seven years to 2013, he funded 40 startups, of which, only six were by women. This year, the gender mix has changed. Of his 10 investments in 2014, six startups are founded or co-founded by women. All technology-driven businesses. "It's a shift from the past, when women would be seen in more non-tech startups," says Anandan. "These are hardcore tech startups, which have a capability to compete with the best in the world."
So, for example, Neha Behani, 31, has co-founded Moojic, an in-store engagement platform. Priyanka Gill, 34, and Namrata Bostrom, 29, have launched PopXO, a digital publishing platform targeting young women readers in urban India. Arathi Kuppu, 41, an MS in computer science and a mother of two, has started Cherish Maternity, an e-tailer whose products target pregnant women and young mothers.
  Those loaded gender questions or implicit inferences — how will you run your business being a woman, what are your marriage plans, will you stop working if and when you have kids, will you relocate if your spouse moves, can you stay alone at a hotel — have not disappeared and will not either. But women entrepreneurs like Behani, Gill, Bostrom and Kuppu are doing a lot to turn the prism of scrutiny, evaluation and decision-making in the startup investing ecosystem away from gender to business.
Pulls And Pressures
There's a long way to go towards gender parity, but the momentum is building. Indian Angel Network (IAN), a Delhi-based grouping of about 200 angel investors, gets 320-340 ideas a month seeking angel funding. "A year back, 5-6% of these were women-led and now that's jumped to 14-15%," says Padmaja Ruparel, president of IAN, who heads a male-dominated club of angel investors. "They are in traditionally thought to be male businesses like drug trials, water and even fashion and beauty products. And most women founders are below 35." Pranshu Bhandari, 28 years of age and based in Jaipur, co-founded CultureAlley with her husband, Nishant Patni, while they were in college.
CultureAlley is a language learning app. "At any point, one billion people are learning a foreign language globally, 60% of them English," says Bhandari. "Our app targets this market."
Bhandari finished her BTech in software engineering and MBA in 2009, both from Narsee Monjee Institute, Mumbai. She had brief stints at Sun Microsystems and Pitney Bowes before turning entrepreneur, a shift her family supported. "My father was actually disappointed when I was doing a job," she says. "He wanted me to do something on my own. Both me and my husband come from business families."
For the women entrepreneurs in Anandan's portfolio, family was not an issue. The outside world was. "There was no pressure from family. My batchmates and society questioned me more," says Sankar, who handles business development and marketing at SocialCops.
One batchmate who didn't was Varun Banka, co-founder and head of the technology piece at SocialCops. "I believe any organisation must have diversity as consumers include both men and women," says Banka. The duo did not come across investors who raised gender questions. But, adds Banka: "We would have rejected investors if they doubted the longevity of the startup because one of the co-founders is a woman."

Number of women executives taking GMAT at all-time highAustralia
(The total number of women…)
MUMBAI: With Indian and global multinationals wanting more women in their workforce, seasoned women executives appear to be keen to re-skill. According to the latest data from Graduate Management Admission Council , which conducts the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the number of women from India taking the test in the age group of 25-40 years, who are mostly professionals with work experience, have risen to an all-time high with a 14% increase year on year.
The total number of women from India appearing for the GMAT also hit an all-time high in 2014, with a 17% increase in July-June 2014, compared with the same period a year ago. This compares with a 12% increase in the number of GMAT test takers (men and women combined) from TY2013 to TY2014, suggesting that the pace of growth of women test takers from India has surpassed the growth in the total number of Indian test takers (men and women combined). The total number of women also include a 20.2% increase in the number of women in the age group below 25.
GMAC data is presented in testing years. A testing year (TY) runs from July 1 to June 30, mirroring the academic year. "Most large and evolved organisations are taking a much greater interest in furthering the career of women. There is a lot more conviction and seriousness around their careers," says Amitabh Jhingan, partner and education sector leader at consulting firm EY. That is driving this uptick in the number of women professionals wanting to re-skill, he adds.
The top 10 Destinations to which Indian citizens, both men and women, sent their scores in TY 2014 include US (55.4%), India (6.2%), Singapore (6.6%), UK (5.8%), Canada (5.1%), France (4.7%), Spain (1.4%), Australia (1.0%), Germany (0.8%), and Hong Kong (0.7%).
"We wanted more women to come into this. Whoever we talk to - corporate recruiters, business schools - all want more women...We started systematically with candidate outreach in campuses, particularly those that are womenonly. We talked to them about GMAT as an option to study abroad and in India," says Ashish Bhardwaj, vice president - Asia Pacific at GMAC. The GMAT exam is valid for admission into masters, MBA and executive MBA in India and abroad. The test scores are valid for five years.
The 14% increase in the number of women test takers in the age group of 25-40 years could also suggest that pressures of marriage and motherhood are no longer forbidding mid-level women professionals from opting for further education.
The increase is a clear pointer that women's aspiration and confidence levels have gone up, which in turn is boosted by a feeling that their aspirations will be met. This also means more women will be hired, says Saundarya Rajesh, founder and head of Avtar Career Creators, a talent strategy consulting firm. "We have seen that this hiring sentiment of organisations has gone up in the past 6-8 months and more importantly, the intent to hire women has gone up... This is also a clear indication that more women are wanting to be hired. That is (seen in) the trend of women returning to the workplace," she adds.
The focus is shifting from technology to behavioural and leadership skills as one grows. "Corporate India has raised the benchmark on their expectations from potential talent available in the market. Also, upskilling is essential at varied levels of career progression," says Gayathri Ramamurthy, lead - diversity and inclusion at Capgemini India.
Also, there are more women role models, which could be prompting an increasing number of women professionals to reskill. "There are many more women in the CEO/CXO position than five years ago," says Savita Mahajan, deputy dean, ISB.
Besides sectors like banking and finance, which have been seeing women at senior levels for a few years, e-commerce and technology services are also seeing more women, she adds.
Another motivator could be the increase in the number of young women getting into start-ups and entrepreneurial situations, says Mahajan.
Moreover, with an increasing number of multinational companies setting up their offices in India and strengthening the support system for women in the form of flexible work policies, work from home, sabbatical and sometimes even corporate sponsorship, there is this growing trend of women professionals wanting to up-skill, said experts. "Gender is very much a part of agenda for the MNCs outside and they are bringing it to India as well," says Mahajan.

Infrastructure companies in hunt for women directors to meet Sebi stipulation

Director
(“Companies are looking…)
MUMBAI: Several infrastructure companies, including blue-chips like Larsen & Toubro, are scouting for a lady independent director to meet Sebi stipulation as they do not have women on top positions who can be elevated as directors.
In an attempt to encourage diversity, the Securities & Exchange Boardof India has made it mandatory for all listed companies to have at least one woman director. The regulator had extended the deadline for this to April 1, 2015, from October 1, 2014, as many companies were unable to comply with this requirement.
Meeting this norm was tougher for infrastructure developers, power, port and roads companies since many of them did not have women on board, and due to the very nature of the industry, they did not have women in leadership positions who could have been elevated to join the board. "We see the mandatory requirement of at least one lady director on the board as progressive, as it sends out a strong message in the organisation about our commitment to gender diversity," said R Shankar Raman, chief financial officer, Larsen&Toubro.
"There is a dearth of senior lady employees in the infrastructure sector. Talent development in an engineering and construction company often begins with roles at remote construction sites, but it isn't easy to find female employees able to accept such roles. On the other hand, there are large numbers of lady employees in our engineering-design centres, and are valuable assets in such roles,"headded. Prompted by the Sebi norm, India's largest private company Reliance Industries got its first woman director by inducting Nita Ambani , wife of chairman Mukesh Ambani, earlier this year. While some infrastructure companies have already appointed woman directors, companies like L&T, Adani Power, AdaniPorts, SimplexInfrastructure, among others, are still looking.
"There are not many women with backgroundin infrastructure,but it is not necessary that all director shave the same domain knowledge. We wanted someone who brings a unique attribute that can help us. Nirupama Rao has good understanding of country risks and challenges and it will help us in international business," said Ramesh Chandak, managing directorandCEOof KECInternational.
RPG Group's flagship infrastructure company KEC International recently appointed Rao, a former bureaucrat who was ambassador to China and the US and also served as the Foreign Secretary of India from2009 to 2011.
"There's a lack of women in leadership positionsincoresectorsaswellasinmanufacturing. Right now, companies are looking for women directors only to meet regulatory requirements and this does notchange the trendbut it isamovein the right direction," said K Sudarshan, managing director, EMA Partners International, anexecutive search firm.
"Companies are looking for women from different fields but preferably someone they have had an association with in the pastandhave comfort with," he said.

Tariff cap to stop power cos from passing on auction costTariff cap prices to stop power companies from passing on auction cost of coal blocks

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
(Of the 204 coal blocks cancelled…)
NEW DELHI: The government is likely to cap prices of power generated from auctioned coal blocks to prevent companies from inflating electricity bills and profiteering, besides allowing successful bidders to use coal from a block in different power plants of the group.
While the government believes that capping prices is necessary to keep electricity tariffs in check, power companies said they should be allowed to pass on the input cost to consumers since they will be paying a huge premium for the coal blocks. "We are working on a legal formulation to cap power tariff at a certain level for each block. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission may be asked to cap prices so companies do not pass on the entire cost of coal to tariffs. There will be a limit to fuel pass-through," a senior government official said.
The official, who did not wish to be identified, said price ceiling would promote efficient utilisation of coal while discouraging companies from bidding arbitrarily for blocks auctioned for power sector. The proposal, which will be part of the 'auction methodology' being prepared by the coal ministry, will be discussed with the power ministry on Tuesday at a meet to discuss auction methodology for power, cement and steel sectors and will be later sent to the Cabinet for approval, the official said. Power firms with existing or proposed end-use projects will be allowed to participate in the auction, expected to kick off before January.
Of the 204 coal blocks cancelled by the Supreme Court , 59 were allocated to power plants with combined capacity of over 67,000-mw capacity. Some of these have power purchase agreements with staterun distribution companies at a price determined through tariff-based bidding while some plants have agreements that provide fuel cost pass-through. Aprivate developer, who did not wish to be identified, said, "Price capping could have been done had the blocks been given to us for free or at a discount. Expecting us to pay for the blocks, pay royalty, develop them with all difficulties and absorbing costs by keeping the tariffs low is absurd and unfair."
The capping proposal replaces the bidding framework prepared by the UPA under which it offered 90% discount on coal blocks to power companies to keep electricity rates low. The UPA government sought to offer blocks to power firms via a UMPP-like tariff-based bidding.

Bottled-in-India Jim Beam to become 25 per cent cheaperLast year, Japan's oldest whisky maker Suntory snapped up Beam Inc, creating a $16-billion combine with a portfolio of bourbon, scotch, Japanese and Irish whiskies.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BANGALORE: Global whisky powerhouse Beam Suntory has started local bottling of its flagship bourbon Jim Beam betting on India's changing whisky habits. This is one of the rare instances of the largest selling bourbon being bottled outside the home market US, underscoring the significance attached to India, the biggest consumer of whiskies.
Bourbon is a barrel-aged American whisky primarily made of corn and with a subdued caramel flavour, making it a mixable drink. India's young consumers are increasingly experimenting with their whiskies, often taking it as a cocktail or mixed with colas. The 200-year-old Jim Beam sells 7 million cases annually, competing with scotch whiskies worldwide.
Last year, Japan's oldest whisky maker Suntory snapped up Beam Inc, creating a $16-billion combine with a portfolio of bourbon, scotch, Japanese and Irish whiskies.
Jim Beam is being bottled at the same facility in Rajasthan where the company's blended scotch brand Teacher's is also produced. As of now, the locally bottled version of Jim Beam is being retailed in Gurgaon and Kolkata, and has just entered the Bangalore market. Jim Beam will now cost 20-25% less, competitively priced against standard scotch rivals bottled in India. The retail price for a 750ml bottle is Rs 1,250 in Gurgaon.
"The brand will be our second pillar of growth in the country," said Neeraj Kumar, director (marketing and sales), Beam Suntory India. Teacher's Highland Cream, with volumes of 220,000 cases (of 9 litres each) in 2013, according to International Wine and Spirits Research (IWSR) data, is Beam Suntory's top selling spirits brand in the country. The standard Jim Beam White variant reported sales of 11,000 cases, while the more premium black variant logged sales of 1,350 cases in 2013.
Kumar said that India was an exciting emerging market for premium international spirits and the number of consumers looking for newer expressions of whiskies was growing steadily. The sweeter and more versatile bourbon blends are now looking to test the hold of scotch whiskies - traditionally had with soda or water - in India's high-end market. "In India, the use of mixology and demand for versatile spirits is on the rise. Jim Beam is a very good mix with cola or with ginger-ale and is used in cocktails," said Kumar. Beam Suntory is targeting new consumers who have entered the legal drinking age as well as consumers in the age bracket of 30-plus. Indian consumers have shied away from making whisky a tall drink until recently, even though whisky, globally, has become younger by becoming a part of the cocktail circuits.
Internationally, Jim Beam has a sizeable portfolio of flavoured variants such as Honey, which at a later date could trickle into the Indian market. "Once we have confidence about there being a strong demand, we will certainly review our portfolio to get in more flavours as well as the RTD (ready-to-drink) variant," said Kumar.

Aadhaar likely to be mandatory for issuance of passport
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 05.27AM IST
(In the new process, the applicant,…)
NEW DELHI: Government is planning to make Aadhaar mandatory for issue of passports and is in the process of establishing a system for validation of criminal antecedents of the applicant.
The issue was discussed threadbare at a meeting between the Ministries of the Home and the External Affairs, official sources said today.
The MEA is working with the Unique Identification Authority of India to implement it and the process is expected to be completed by the end of this month.
In the new process, the applicant, if not in possession of an Aadhaar card, has to produce the Aadhaar enrolment number.
The move has been taken up as per the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has favoured faster passport services in a transparent and simplified manner to the citizens.
A number of complaints are being received regularly by the government related to police verification for passports and consequent delay in issuance of the travel document.
The MEA had a meeting with the National Crime Record Bureau, under the Home Ministry, and the latter confirmed that they will be able to establish a system for validation of criminal antecedents of the applicant.
"NCRB has confirmed that they will be able to set up the validation mechanism within two months. Once this is established, the criminal antecedents of the applicants for all categories will be validated on NCRB database before passport issuance," an official note prepared on the issue said.
The MEA is of the view that when an applicant already has an Aadhaar card or has applied for, his identity to a major extent is established -- this needs to be confirmed by UIDAI.
Therefore, based on NCRB validation and the applicant's self declaration on the aspects of citizenship, criminal antecedents, criminal proceedings, summons/ warrants etc. the passport can be issued on post-police verification basis.
While granting the passport, the applicant will also be given the address of police station which is responsible for the police verification so that the applicant can also actively pursue and complete the process of verification before travelling abroad.
"In the event of any wrong declaration by the applicant, the passport will be impounded/ revoked as per specified procedure," the note said.
Though all the applicants in their passport application forms specifically declare information relating to their nationality, criminal antecedents, pendency of court proceedings, warrants/ summons etc. over a period of time, the government agencies, institute the police verification mechanism to verify the provisions that have been referred in the Passport Act.
The present practice is that police verification is required for issue of fresh passports if the applicant does not apply under the Tatkal category.
For the Tatkal category, additional documents, including verification certificate, are required. Also, in the case of re-issue passports, passports are issued without reference to the police, based on the self declaration of the applicants.
  After the receipt of police verification reports, passports are issued within a week. Passports are also issued within a week of application in respect of minor applicants, re-issue cases, Tatkaal etc. in which police verification is not required or is done on post-verification basis.
The move came after a U-turn by the Home Ministry from its earlier stand and coming out in full support of Aadhaar scheme saying it will facilitate "anytime, anywhere, anyhow" authentication to its beneficiaries.
In a letter to all state governments, the Home Ministry had last month said that since one Aadhaar number is allotted only to one person, it allows universal verification of one's identity.
"Since Aadhaar is based on the demographic and biometric information of an individual, it eliminates the threat of any fraud and bogus activity.
"Aadhaar will provide its possessor with universal identification. (It) will facilitate 'anytime, anywhere, anyhow' authentication to its beneficiaries (and) be a single source of identity verification," the Home Ministry had said.
The ministry's stand on Aadhaar is in complete reversal of the position taken by it under two predecessors of Home Minister Rajnath Singh -- Sushilkumar Shinde and P Chidambaram.
During the UPA regime, the Home Ministry had raised concerns over the sanctity of the the Unique Identification Authority of India's database, saying uniqueness of identity was not a necessary condition for ensuring authenticity of identity or genuineness of other entries or records of Aadhaar numbers.
The ministry had also flagged concerns over supporting documents submitted by people as proof of identity and proof of address for getting an Aadhaar number.

Pak schools rage over Malala Yousafzai driven Salman Rushdie rowEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
A network of private schools in Pakistan today observed ‘I am not Malala’ day to condemn Nobel laureate and teenage girls rights activist for her alleged support for controversial British novelist Salman Rushdie.
Malala Yousafzai, 17, shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012 in Pakistan’s northwestern town of Mingora, won Nobel Peace Prize 2014 with 60-year-old Indian anti-child labour activist Kailash Satyarthi.
All Pakistan Private Schools Federation, which last year banned the Malala’s memoir “I am Malala”, organised the “I am not Malala” day.
In a statement, the federation president Mirza Kashif Ali alleged that “Malala has nexus with Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin”.
He said Malala’s book, written with British journalist Christina Lamb, was too sympathetic to Rushdie.
Ali said Rushdie’s book was clearly “anti-Islam” and by supporting him, Malala has joined his club.
“We severely condemned the chapter of the book in which Rushdie’s book has been mentioned as freedom of expression by Malala while referring to father’s views,” said Ali.
Rushdie’s book The Static Verses in 1989 created a storm in Muslim world. Bangladeshi author Nasrin was accused by radical Muslims of blasphemy over her novel “Lajja” in 1994.
Malala, who lives in Britain where she went for treatment after the Taliban attack, won worldwide acclaim for her campaign advocating education for girls in Pakistan.
However, some conservative circles in Pakistan allege that she was being used by the West.
It is also believed that the private school might be targeting her to create sympathy among the Taliban who have destroyed hundreds of schools in the country.

PM invites views on his three-nation tourPM invites views on his three-nation tour
PTI
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
New Delhi, Nov 11:  
As he embarked on a three-nation tour that will also take him to Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today invited ideas and thoughts for his visit to that country.
“Do keep sharing thoughts & ideas for the visit. Here is a great place to keep updated on the visit,” Modi tweeted.
He also gave a link of the website where the ideas could be shared by people.
A fortnight ago too, he had asked people to share their ideas and thoughts on important issues for Indians, including those living in Australia.
He had said that during his Australia visit, he would be attending a variety of programmes, including an interaction with the Indian community there.
“I want to hear ideas and thoughts from all of you, including friends in Australia and the Indian community there on my visit,” the Prime Minister had then tweeted.
Modi’s first stop will be Myanmar, where he will attend East Asia Summit (EAS) on November 12-13 in the Myanmar capital Nay Pyi Taw. From there, he will go to Brisbane for a G-20 meet on November 15-16.
From Brisbane, Modi will travel to Canberra to hold a bilateral meeting with Australian counterpart Tony Abbott on November 18. This will be second meeting between the two leaders after Abbott visited India last month during which the two countries inked the civil nuclear cooperation agreement.
From Australia, he is likely to go to Fiji on November 19.
Modi, who will be the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, will deliver an address to a joint sitting of federal parliament.
“Summits, important bilaterals, meeting over 40 world leaders. Leaving for Myanmar, Australia & Fiji,” the Prime Minister said in another tweet.
Tributes
He also paid tributes to noted freedom fighter Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Gandhian and socialist Acharya J B Kripalani.
“Tributes to Acharya Kripalani on his birth anniversary. His ideals & strong commitment to serve the poor continue to inspire.
“Scholar, freedom fighter & a man who devoted his life towards nation building, I salute Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on his birth anniversary,” Modi said.

Aligarh Muslim University VC says girls in library will attract boys
The Women's College students, who have never been allowed entry to the Maulana Azad Library, asked for access to the library as it is has a better collection of books than their college library.

ALIGARH: Aligarh Muslim University vice chancellor Zameeruddin Shah rejected the demand of women students for access to the varsity's Maulana Azad Library, saying that there would be 'four times more boys' in the library' if girls were allowed in.
The Women's College students, who have never been allowed entry to the Maulana Azad Library, asked for access to the library as it is has a better collection of books than their college library.
Justifying why girls should not be allowed membership, the vice chancellor said that the issue is not of discipline but of space and added that the library is always jam-packed.
"These reports are completely wrong. I said there is no space for even a single seat in that library. We are not sexist and we also want women empowerment and certainly don't want to segregate our girls," Shah said.
Defending himself, Shah added: "In the women's college we have given grants of Rs 11 lakh so that the library could be improved with air conditioners like in the Maulana Azad library. Every book which is there at Maulana Library is already available online for the girls."
The Times of India in a report quoted Women's College principal Naima Gulrez saying: 'We understand the demand for access to the library. But have you girls ever seen the library? It is jam-packed with boys. If girls too were to be present in it, the discipline issue might crop up.'
Reacting to Zameeruddin Shah's statement, Women's College Students union president Gulfiza Khan said that instead of imposing restrictions on girls, the college authorities should introduce safety measures.
"I don't think there should be any such restriction,but if it's a matter of safety and security, then they should themselves take some measures instead of stopping us," said Khan.
She added that 'if girls will come to the library, boys will get attracted to them', she added, "He was saying it in the context of the security of girls that outsiders may also come there. But, I think, that the measures should be taken from his side on safety and security. We should not be stopped from going there.'
Reiterating the students' demand, Khan said, "We demanded that we should be given the ID cards for library so that we can go there. But the VC said that the space is very less for girls. However, according to me, when we are the part of AMU, and when the Maulana Azad Library is also a part of the university, then ID cards should be given to us. If not to sit due to space issue, but at least we should be allowed to get books issued from there."

Centre-States Differences Persist Over Key Aspects of GSTMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Differences between the Centre and states over some key provisions of the Goods and Services Tax remain, with the Empowered Committee insisting that threshold turnover for levying GST be retained at Rs 10 lakh and petroleum be kept out of the purview of the new tax regime.
The Empowered Committee of state FMs, which met here on Tuesday, however, expressed hope that the GST could be rolled out by April 1, 2016, notwithstanding the hitches.
Talking to reporters, GST Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said that the Centre had written to him suggesting that the threshold annual turnover for levying GST should be increased to Rs 25 lakh from Rs 10 lakh.
The states had in August decided that the threshold be fixed at Rs 10 lakh and had informed that to the Centre.
"In September, the Centre wrote to us suggesting that this decision of the Empowered Committee should be reviewed. The Centre suggested that the limit should be Rs 25 lakh. Even if it is not Rs 25 lakh, Rs 10 lakh limit should be increased."
"But finally the Committee took a decision that they will go by the decision that is already taken that is Rs 10 lakh," Mr Rather said, adding that the final call on threshold will be decided by the GST Council.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill. The Finance Ministry is in the process of preparing a Cabinet note on the GST Bill.
States want that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST. The states are yet to receive the draft constitutional amendment bill from the Centre.
"States have already said that petroleum, alcohol, tobacco should be excluded from GST. We are waiting for response from Centre. We have not received the revised draft Bill. We will discuss and offer our comments (after we receive it)," he said.
The Empowered Committee also reviewed the revenue neutral rate for the GST, comprising C-GST and S-GST, as suggested by a GST sub-committee.
The sub-committee had suggested S-GST rate at 13.91 per cent and C-GST rate at 12.77 per cent.
As regards the items exempted from the purview of GST, the committee suggested that they should be mentioned in the Constitutional Amendment Bill.
Mr Rather said the states have made it clear to the Centre that while preparing the draft GST Bill the views of the states should be respected.
"I have made it abundantly clear to the Government of India because that will be in the true spirit of cooperative federalism. States should be carried along. If all goes well, the Constitutional Amendment Bill is carried in Parliament by both the Houses, I think the 2016 target roll out date is achievable," he said.
The Centre is planning to provide Rs 13,000 crore on account of CST compensation to states for dues till March 2010 and is likely to seek Parliament approval for the same in the ensuing Winter Session of Parliament beginning November 24.
"States have said that compensation should be constitutionally provided," Mr Rather said.
CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of value-added tax (VAT). The Centre had then promised the states that it would bear losses due to reduction of CST.
As per the compensation mechanism, the Centre would bear 100 per cent of the loss accrued to states in fiscal year 2010-11 on account of lowering of CST. However, for fiscal years 2011-12 and 2012-13, the Centre would give 75 per cent and 50 per cent of the losses to the states.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.
Hinting that GST Constitutional Amendment Bill may be introduced in the ensuing Winter session of Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said the government was in the final stages of talks with states on the issue.

RBI nudges foreign banks into commercial spaceRBI nudges foreign banks into commercial space
Our Bureau
R Gandhi, Deputy Governor, RBI
Will help ensure further penetration of banking in the country, says R Gandhi
Mumbai, November 11:  
Reserve Bank of India wants foreign banks to not restrict themselves to doing only niche banking such as corporate, wholesale and investment banking but also offer commercial banking in the country, according to a top official.
Undertaking a bouquet of activities as would be required of a commercial bank will ensure further penetration of banking activities.
“The rationale for such request stems from the limited geographical reach, stymied business model for foreign branch operations, lack of expertise in local market, etc.
“…On account of the typical requirements of the economy, it is our desire and expectation that the foreign banks offer commercial banking with a view to ensure further penetration of banking activities,” said R Gandhi, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, in his keynote address at ASIFMA Annual Conference in Singapore last week.
Needless to indicate that in the process foreign banks could diversify their risks and also it helps to tap the available latent opportunities, he said.
The RBI issues universal banking licence to foreign banks for conducting all type of banking business.
There is no restriction as to the type of business to be conducted through branches unlike in some other countries where restrictions are placed on foreign bank branches on acceptance of retail deposits, conducting business in local currency, types of clientele, availability of deposit insurance, access to clearing and settlement systems etc.
As on October 31, 2014, there were 44 foreign banks in India operating through a network of 318 branches. Also, 45 foreign banks have presence in India in the form of representative offices.
The share of foreign banks in total assets of the banking sector in India is 6.5 per cent. The operations of foreign banks are skewed and mainly concentrated in urban and metropolitan areas.
Out of the total of 318 foreign bank branches, 315 are in urban and metropolitan areas. Foreign banks account for less than one per cent of total branches of commercial banks in India.

(The deal, which was done…)
MUMBAI: Radhakishan Damani , a leading stock investor and owner of retail chain D-Mart, has bought 37,000 square feet spread over five floors in an office building in Nariman Point, Mumbai's upmarket business locality. The deal, which was done between Damani's Bright Star Investments and the Indian arm of French multinational pharma company Sanofi, was concluded at Rs 134.25 crore.
The transaction is valued at over Rs 36,000 per sq ft on carpet basis and is in line with current market price for office spaces in Nariman Point. While corporate entities keen on shifting to other business districts from Nariman Point, the deal indicates market prices here are also holding its average momentum, said brokers operating in the first business district of Mumbai. Transaction advisor Cushman & Wakefield declined to comment.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the quarter ending December 31, said Sanofi in a release to BSE. All the floors are currently on lease, it said. Sanofi India had acquired 150,000 sq ft of office space from L&T Realty at its new project in Powai, a suburb in Mumbai, for Rs 220 crore in early 2013. This was among the largest deal in terms of value during the year.
Damani, who works from his office at Dalamal Estate at Nariman Point, is known to be an astute investor.
Rough estimates suggest that valuation for Damani's retail chain D-Mart could work out to more than Rs 5,000 crore. Its revenues have increased from Rs 260 crore in 2006-07 to Rs 3,334 crore in 2012-13, and are projected to hit Rs 4,500 crore this year, which would make it India's third-largest branded retail chain.

(“They are getting more…)
MUMBAI: Tata Consultancy Services, the information technology unit of the Tata Group, is more than a quarter of the way to its goal of garnering $1 billion (more than Rs 6,150 crore) in revenue from the group's companies, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Cyrus Mistry, the group's chairman, had asked heads of Tata companies to begin shifting work to TCS two years ago. TCS used to receive about $100 million a year from Tata Group companies, less than a tenth of what the group companies are estimated to spend on information technology. But that has begun to change.
"They are getting more business from the group companies. I would say, that they would be close to $350 million a year from the group companies," an executive with a group company, who declined to be named, told ET. TCS said it doesn't provide client specific information. The company posted revenue of $13.4 billion in fiscal 2014.
TCS has also been winning back deals it had lost to global players such as International Business Machines. In 2012, the company won a $385 million deal from Tata Motors-owned British auto maker Jaguar Land Rover . It was the IT backbone for the Tata Group's joint venture with Starbucks and with Tata International's venture with fashion manufacturer Wolverine WorldWide. Revenue from these two deals could not be ascertained. TCS also counts Tata Teleservices , Tata Sky , Tata Capital and Infiniti Retail, that runs the group's electronics chain Croma, as clients, its annual report showed. In fact, Tata Sky, Tata Capital and Infiniti Retail increased their spending with the company in fiscal 2014.
"There is no doubt that they are getting more aggressive with the Tata Group companies. I would say about 25-30% of the IT work has moved or is in the process of moving to them," a source with knowledge of the group's IT spending said. While IT arms of large conglomerates could feel like the work is theirs for the taking, TCS still maintains that it has a long way to go to winning all of the Tata Group's IT expenditure.
"I think we have a small presence in the group; it's still small, even if that is the number ($350 million)," TCS chief executive N Chandrasekaran said in a recent interview. "The potential of the group is very high. We can still work with many group companies. The group can be a productive customer, but we have to work and compete like anybody else."
Experts who track IT spending in India say there is no issue with the Tata Group asking its group companies to use its IT arm. "TCS is one of the best IT companies in the world and they are doing well on their own as well. They win contracts competing against the best companies as it is," said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. "I don't see that there is anything wrong with the Tata Group wanting to move work to them. It makes sense."

IOC, BPCL, HPCL to go for round III of fuel price cuts, reduction likely on November 15

NEW DELHI: State oil firms plan to cut petrol rates for the seventh time since June and diesel for the third time since the fuel was decontrolled on October 18 as Indian consumers gain from the sharp fall in global oil prices before polls in Jharkhand and Jammu & Kashmir.
Industry experts said according to current trend Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd ( BPCL ) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd ( HPCL ) are likely to reduce pump price of petrol and diesel by about Rs 1 per litre by the end of this week. For consumers, the two fuels are already 10%-13% cheaper than their peak earlier in the year.
Fuel prices are reviewed and aligned with global trends in the beginning and middle of every month. Prices are likely to be cut on Nov 15, barely 10 days before assembly elections begin in two states.
The cuts could be steeper depending on further slide in international prices of auto fuels in next four days, official sources said. The government has allowed state fuel retailers to align pump prices of petrol and diesel with international market. Benchmark Brent crude dropped four years low at around $82 per barrel on Tuesday.
"International gasoline and diesel prices have so far dropped by $1-3 per barrel since the last price revision on Oct 31. Prices may drop further by Saturday, when companies will review their retail selling price. Reductions would depend on the 15-days average rates of diesel and gasoline fortnight and the rupee-dollar exchange rate that determines the landed cost of fuel if it is imported," an industry source said.
Last time, oil companies reduced petrol prices by Rs 2.41 per litre and diesel by Rs 2.25 on Oct 31. So far, companies have reduced petrol prices by 13% or Rs 9.36 per litre in six consecutive rate revision. They reduced diesel price by about 10% or Rs 5.62 per litre in just two revision since the fuel price was deregulated on Oct 18. Currently, petrol is sold at Rs 64.24 per litre in Delhi and diesel at Rs 53.35 per litre.
Companies are also expected to marginally reduce revenue losses on cooking gas, where they are losing about Rs 394 per 14.2 kilogram cylinder.
The government deregulated diesel prices last month. Companies also enjoys petrol pricing freedom since June 2010. But, this freedom is not absolute as companies would require tacit approval of the oil ministry before changing pump prices of petrol and diesel, sources said.
It is likely that the government would not pass the entire pricing benefits to the consumer for political reasons. The international oil market is highly volatile and a cushion is required to absorb pricing shock if rates move north, especially during month-long assembly elections, sources said. The five-phase polling in Jharkhand and J&K would start from November 25 and continue for almost a month. Results for the two assembly elections would be declared on December 29.

Alibaba reports record $9 billion China's Singles Day sales

(The shopping day, similar…)
HANGZHOU(CHINA): E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd reported more than $9 billion in sales on China's Singles' Day on Tuesday, illustrating the buying power of the Chinese consumer and the importance of the event in the retail calendar.
Real-time figures on a giant screen at Alibaba's sprawling Hangzhou campus surged past 2013's record to 57.1 billion yuan ($9.3 billion) just after midnight after Chinese and overseas shoppers snapped up heavily discounted goods online.
The shopping day, similar to Cyber Monday and Black Friday in the United States, comes less than eight weeks after Alibaba's record $25 billion public share listing in New York.
Founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma said earlier on Tuesday that Alibaba's financial services arm, Alipay , also "will definitely go public", probably in China.
Ma later spoke briefly to reporters, saying he felt a bit nervous" due to the higher pressures and expectations now that Alibaba is a listed company.
Alibaba turned Singles' Day, a Nov. 11 Chinese response to Valentine's Day, into an online shopping festival in 2009.
It copyrighted the "Double 11" term three years later after recognising its commercial potential.
"You're seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer," Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman, told reporters.
Alibaba had sales of 35 billion yuan during last year's festival.
The numbers this year were boosted by a "pre-sales initiative" under which merchants advertised prices as early as Oct. 15, taking deposits for the items but only processing full payments and shipping the goods on Singles' Day itself.
Though the 27,000 vendors that take part can boost their sales and gain customers by being featured on Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping sites, some have complained that discounts and cut-throat corporate rivalry undercut the benefits.
Rivals such as JD.com Inc, Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Yihaodian have all gotten in on the Singles' Day act, but Tsai was bullish about Alibaba's pole position.
"I don't think any other company in China can create a day like this," he said.
The "11.11 Shopping Festival" began with just 27 merchants in 2009. This year's festival is global, reaching shoppers in more than 200 countries, the company said.

Yahoo buys digital advertising service BrightRoll for $640 million

(Yahoo Inc. has promised…)
SAN FRANCISCO: Yahoo is buying digital video advertising service BrightRoll for $640 million in the Internet company's latest attempt to boost its revenue after years filled mostly with financial futility.
The acquisition announced Tuesday marks Yahoo's first major purchase since reaping a $9.4 billion windfall in September by selling part of its stake in a rapidly rising Internet star, Chinese e-commerce service Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
Yahoo Inc. has promised to distribute at least half of the $6.3 billion in after-tax proceeds from the Alibaba stake sale to its shareholders. That gives CEO Marissa Mayer the option of spending the rest on acquisitions that could enable the Sunnyvale, California, company to recover some of the ground that it has lost to rivals Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. in the booming online ad market.
BrightRoll, based in San Francisco, helps to automatically place ads in videos displayed on personal computers and mobile devices. Since its founding in 2006, it has built relationships with most of the biggest advertisers in the U.S., helping the service generate more than $100 million in annual revenue, according to Yahoo.
That makes the BrightRoll deal look quite different from the only larger acquisition that Yahoo has made since hiring Mayer as its CEO in July 2012. Mayer bought online blogging service Tumblr for $1.1 billion last year, even though that New York company hadn't yet proven it could make money.
In contrast, BrightRoll already is profitable, according to Yahoo. Meanwhile, Tumblr isn't expected to bring in $100 million in annual revenue until next year, at the earliest.
"Acquiring BrightRoll will dramatically strengthen Yahoo's video advertising platform," Mayer predicted in a Tuesday blog post.
Investors didn't seem to be as enthusiastic about the deal. Yahoo's stock dipped 3 cents to $49.02 in extended trading.
If Mayer is right, BrightRoll could help Yahoo reverse a long-running decline in display advertising - a category consisting of video pitches and other marketing with a visual element. Through the first nine months of this year, Yahoo's display advertising revenue had declined 4 percent from last year to $1.2 billion after subtracting commissions.
Meanwhile, ad revenue at Google and Facebook has been steadily rising by 20 percent or more in most quarters as marketers pour money into digital campaigns to connect with consumers spending more time gazing into screens on PCs and mobile devices.
Yahoo's share of the worldwide ad market now stands at about 2.4 percent, down from 3.9 percent in 2011, according to the research firm eMarketer. Facebook's share has climbed from 3.6 percent in 2011 to a projected 8 percent this year while Google has held on to a 32 percent share of a much larger market.
"This plugs a hole for (Yahoo)," said Outsell analyst Randy Giusto. "They obviously needed to do something."
Mayer is under more pressure to get Yahoo rolling in the right direction now that the company has brought in more money from its recent sale of Alibaba stock. What's more, Yahoo still owns 384 million shares of Alibaba stock currently worth $44 billion. The Alibaba holdings are the main reason that Yahoo's stock has been hovering around its highest levels in more than 14 years.
Activist shareholder Starboard Value LP issued a challenge to Mayer in September in a letter critical of the more than 30 acquisitions that she had previously made for a total of about $1.6 billion. Those acquisitions seemed to make little financial sense, according to Starboard, which urged Mayer to consider buying rival AOL Inc. as a way to save money and bring in more ad revenue.
Yahoo so far hasn't given any indication that it's interested in joining forces with AOL, which currently has a market value of about $3.5 billion.
Mayer has said that Yahoo is considering ways to minimize taxes on future sales of its Alibaba stock, a step that Starboard had also implored the company to consider.
Starboard didn't immediately respond to requests for comment about the BrightRoll acquisition.

Nikkei hits seven-year highs on tax-relief hopesasian markets
(Equity markets in Asia moved…)
TOKYO: Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Equity markets in the rest of Asia moved little after a flat close in a holiday-thinned Wall Street session, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan off just 0.1 per cent in early trade.
Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8 per cent to hit a fresh seven-year high.
The Sankei newspaper, citing unnamed government and coalition officials, said Abe will delay a planned second sales tax increase by a year and a half and take the issue to voters. Abe on Tuesday said he had yet to decide on the timing of an election.
Abe has said he will make up his mind on the tax increase after assessing the July-September GDP data due next Monday, widely expected to highlight the fragility of the rebound following a sharp contraction in the second quarter.
The first increase in the two-stage sale tax hike in April knocked the Japanese economy hard, and markets view a delay in the second-phase of the tax hike as positive for growth.
A snap election could cement Abe's grip on power because opposition parties are too fragmented to win, despite a decline in the prime minister's approval ratings.
"Short-term players are jumping onto this, although in the long run, this just means a delay in fiscal reform and not necessarily positive," said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
Indeed, Japanese government bond prices fell as a delay in the planned tax hike would heighten doubts on whether Tokyo can achieve its fiscal target to balance the budget outside debt payments by 2020.
  The 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield rose to one-month high of 0.515 per cent, up 3.5 basis points from Tuesday close.
However, given massive bond-buying by the Bank of Japan, investors see limited room for further rises in JGB yields.
The yen, which has remained under pressure for nearly two years due to the BOJ's aggressive stimulus, was on the back foot.
The greenback traded at 115.80 yen, having risen to a seven-year high of 116.11 yen on Tuesday.
The dollar lost a bit of steam against other currencies, as investors took profits from its hefty gains in the last few months.
The euro traded at $1.2477, keeping some distance from a two-year low of $1.2358 hit on Friday.
In the energy market, Brent crude futures in London closed down 67 cents on Tuesday, or 0.8 per cent, at $81.67 a barrel after hitting a four-year low of $81.23. US crude fell 0.7 per cent in Asia on Wednesday.
Some analysts said Brent fared worse on Tuesday because of growing expectations that global producer group OPEC will not cut output.

Aussie Brig pushes hard to help martyr Indian Majors sonAussie Brig ‘pushes’ hard to help martyr Indian Major’s son

Just two years before he was killed in action, Major Mohit Whig ran into William Sowry, a strapping young major in the Australian army deputed to spend a year at India’s prestigious Defence Services Staff College in Wellington. Now 20  years later Sowry is a 52-year-old Brigadier, posted as a defence attache in the United Kingdom, who has set a target of 14,600 push-ups in 23 days to help raise funds for Whig’s disabled son.
Major Whig was appointed William Sowry's 'sponsor' when he spent a year in the Nilgiri Hills.
In 1994 Sowry was posted to the Staff College to spend a year in the Nilgiri hills with his Indian Army counterparts. Major Whig was appointed as his “sponsor” to help him ease into the course.  
Sowry returned to Australia and Whig was posted to the Kashmir valley along with his battalion for counter insurgency duties. On June 4, 1997, Whig was on patrol when a land mine blew up, killing him and three accompanying soldiers. He left behind his wife Tina and two young children, Zorawar and Fateh.
A couple of years ago Sowry discovered the Whigs once again. “We lost touch but through the magic of Facebook I was able to find her (elder) son Zorawar and made contact.” It was then that he learnt about the younger son, Fateh, who was barely a year old when his father was killed. Fateh was born with spina bifida, a rare congenital spinal disorder that has left him disabled since birth.
A few months ago he heard about the Whig family exploring a rehabilitative procedure that could help Fateh regain some degree of normalcy. But the costs were steep and they needed to raise £25,000 to travel to Australia for the medical procedure.
He built a fund-raising campaign he calls PUFF – Push Ups For Fateh. “In the 23 days that the Tour De France takes place, I started doing four pushups for every kilomtere of the race. That means for the 3,660 km I will do 14,642 pushups in 18 days,” Sowry told HT. So far Sowry has already raised £9,000.
"I have had donations from Dubai and Delhi, and from Machu Pichu in South America and throughout friends in Australia. I am humbled by their gesture,” Sowry said. Meanwhile, Whig’s classmates from Doon School have rallied around Sowry’s effort. Filmmaker and military historian Kunal Verma sent out an appeal informing them about his fund-raising efforts. “The overwhelming response I am getting with people wanting to participate in the welfare of our fallen and the wounded, we are looking to take this beyond Mohit,” Verma told HT.
Sowry has written to several senior Indian Army officials and other government functionaries, and he is hoping to hear from them.

Macedonia set to junk deal with Subrata Roy s Sahara  invokes 3 mn guaranteeEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
In a fresh setback to jailed Sahara Group chairman Subrata Roy Sahara, the Macedonian Ministry of Agriculture has begun the process of cancelling an agreement with Sahara to reorganise the Dzumajlija agricultural complex, and activated a 3 million-euro bank guarantee that the group had given to the government in Skopje.
News portal macedoniaonline.eu quoted Sonja Trajkova, spokesperson for the ministry, as having said Saturday: “The Ministry will strictly follow the agreement that was signed. We have said so at several meetings we had with Sahara before we decided to activate the bank guarantee.”
Macedoniaonline added that the activation of Sahara’s bank guarantee was the “first step toward the cancellation of the entire agreement”.
According to the agreement finalised in July last year, Sahara was to develop a 5,500-hectare Dzumajlija farming complex near the city of Sveti Nikole. The Group had announced four separate state-of-the-art dairy farms, as well as facilities for fodder production, to be built over three years.
In response to questions sent by The Indian Express, a Sahara spokesperson said, “As far as the decision taken regarding the bank guarantee is concerned, we feel that it will have negative impact on this mega project which happens to be in the early stage of execution. We can understand why the Macedonian government took this step and we are prepared for the consequences… Macedonia is an important focus point for our offshore business and we are happy to partner with the fast developing country. We are working to arrive at amicable solutions to some specific queries of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water supply; we are confident that it will get resolved.”
Dzumajlija, a troubled farming company which, besides producing grain, also has a winery, dairy plant and a host of other facilities, was leased to Sahara in July last year for EUR 1,21,000 per month. Sahara undertook to hire 900 workers, invest EUR 60 million, and expand the cattle stock by 8,000 cows. The plans for Dzumajlija included large-scale milk and cattle feed production, and exports to Balkan, Middle Eastern and North African countries.
Subrata Roy made three trips to Macedonia in January, July and October last year, and announced big plans for the country —  including an investment of EUR 2.7 billion in businesses in the next five years, building a Macedonian ‘Las Vegas’, and bringing 20,000 cows into the country.
Roy has been in Tihar jail since March 4 after Sahara failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s order to return Rs 24,000 crore to investors.

Brent drops towards $81 as oil glut worries counter disruption risks

(Brent crude fell towards…)
SINGAPORE: Brent crude fell towards $81 a barrel on Wednesday, holding just above a four-year low as concerns over a mounting oil glut outweighed geopolitical and supply disruption risks in Ukraine and Libya.
With oil prices having fallen 30 percent from a mid-June peak, whispering among OPEC delegates ahead of its Nov. 27 meeting is starting to suggest it could informally cut output by around 500,000 barrels a day (bpd).
But delegates within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also warned an agreement will not be easy, and analysts doubt members will take a decisive stance.
"The consensus view is OPEC won't take any action, or if it does, not big enough or sufficiently definitive to have too much impact on prices," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets.
Brent crude for December delivery fell 50 cents to $81.17 a barrel as of 0510 GMT. It dropped 67 cents on Tuesday after first touching $80.46, its lowest since September 2010.
US crude was down 51 cents at $77.43.
Oversupply issues, doubts over whether OPEC would cut production and the strong greenback were weighing on prices in Asia, said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsExpress.
"I would like to think there is a floor at around $80 a barrel ... but I still see more to play out on the downside," he said.
The markets were still assessing if an OPEC cut of 500,000 bpd would make oil prices more vulnerable to the impact of potential supply disruptions caused by geopolitical risks in Libya and other oil producers, Spooner said.
Exports were still blocked at Libya's 120,000 bpd Hariga port by protesters involved in a wages dispute although talks to resolve the issue were underway, an oil official said on Tuesday. The El Sharara oilfield was also still closed.
European Union foreign ministers will meet next week to discuss the possibility of more sanctions on oil and gas producer Russia over the continuing conflict in eastern Ukraine, where there has been renewed heavy shelling.
US oil inventory data due out later Wednesday and Thursday could show a build in crude oil stocks of 800,000 barrels in the week ended Nov. 7, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by nearly 99 points at 28,008.90 on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors despite weak global cues.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty ended higher by 20.65 points at 8,383.30.
Among BSE sectoral indices, auto and banking indices were the star-performers and were up 1.18 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.37 per cent, followed by metal 0.9 per cent, PSU 0.57 per cent and capital goods 0.53 per cent.
Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and ITC were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel, NTPC and L&T.
The benchmark BSE Sensex surged 203.97 points or 0.73 per cent to trade at a new record-high of 28,114.03 in the morning session, breaking its previous peak of 28,027.96 reached on November 10.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade and hit a new life-time high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-share NSE index crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points or 0.53 per cent to trade at a life-time high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said that the domestic sentiment remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed the trading sentiment, they added.
A report by Equentis Capital said: "We expect markets likely to remain positive. Stay cautious and book profits on higher levels. The government will unveil IIP data for September 2014 and annual rate of inflation based on the combined consumer price indices (CPI) for urban and rural India for October 2014 on 12 November 2014. Inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for October 2014 will be released on 14 November 2014. Slower inflation could support regulators (RBI) to increase liquidity in the market in short-term and positive action by the regulators will be good for interest sensitive sectors/stocks."
European stocks
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS , Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Asian shares
Asian stocks extended their gains for the fourth day as Japanese shares climbed after the yen depreciated to a seven-year low amid speculation the nation will delay raising its sales tax again.
Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Nikkei 225 rose 73 points or 0.43 per cent at 17,197 and Hang Seng jumped 184.08 points or 0.77 per cent at 23,992.36.

NBFCs May Take 0.40 Per Cent Hit in Profits Post-New Norms: AnalystsGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
Mumbai: The new framework for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to bring down their profitability by around 40 basis points, or 0.40 per cent, over the next four years, analysts said on Tuesday.
To better address the risks in the business, enhance regulatory coverage, standardise regulations and improve governance standards, the RBI on Monday revised the guidelines for NBFCs, which are to be implemented over the next three financial years.
(Read: Reserve Bank Tightens Rules for NBFCs )
Among other things, the RBI tightened the NPA recognition and provisioning norms for NBFCs to bring them on a par with those applicable for commercial banks.
"The revised regulation will slice around 40 basis points off NBFCs' profitability gradually over the next four years till March 2018," Crisil said in a report.
The rating agency said the decline in profit will be on account of higher provisioning with the stricter recognition norms for non-performing assets (NPAs) made more stringent to 90+ days past due (dpd) from 180+ earlier.
Another rating outfit Icra said the changes are likely to lead to a rise in the reported gross NPA percentage from 4.5 as of June 2014 to 6-8 per cent once they are fully enforced, thereby increasing incremental credit provisioning.
Over the medium term, delinquencies could settle at a lower level as NBFCs realign their monitoring and recovery systems to the 90-day format and as the operating environment improves, alleviating the pressure on the credit profiles of borrowers, Icra said.
Crisil, however, said the three-year transition period will allow NBFCs to cushion impact on their financial profiles.
Icra said the returns on assets of NBFCs as a whole could also drop by 20 bps, which would translate into a 1.1-1.3 per cent dip in returns on equity.
The new guidelines raised the minimum Tier I capital requirements for these financial entities from the current 7.5 to 8.5 per cent by March 2016 and 10 per cent by March 2017.
Most NBFCs maintain a favourable capital structure, and this would enable them to meet the enhanced capital requirements.
"In our estimates, only two or three NBFCs would need to be mobilise additional capital (of around Rs 500 crore or 8-10 per cent of their net worth) to maintain a 2 per cent buffer over the revised Tier I capital requirements," Icra said.

Shiv Sena to vote against BJP govt during trust vote  to sit in OppositionLetters to  the editor
Hours before Devendra Fadnavis government faces trust vote, the Shiv Sena today said it will vote against it in the Maharashtra Assembly.
“Shiv Sena has decided to sit in opposition. We will vote against the trust vote,” senior Sena leader Ramdas Kadam told reporters at Vidhan Bhawan here.
“We have lost faith in them (BJP),” Kadam said.
After Sena president Uddhav Thackeray addressed a meeting of party legislators here last night, Sena sources had said he will announce the party’s stand on trust vote today.
Meanwhile, the BJP said the decision of Sena, with which it had an alliance for 25 years in Maharashtra, was not in the state’s interest.
“The Sena’s decision is against the interests of Maharashtra,” state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said.

Crude oil prices down in Asian tradeCrude oil prices down in Asian trade

Singapore, Sept 17:  
Oil prices fell in Asia today as dealers squared positions following sharp gains in the previous session that were stoked by indications that the OPEC cartel will cut its production target next year.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for October delivery fell 11 cents to $94.77, while Brent crude for November delivery eased 13 cents to $98.92 in mid-morning trade.
WTI jumped $1.96 yesterday, while Brent gained $1.17.
OPEC cartel
“We are seeing some consolidation in the oil market in Asian hours after news of the OPEC production cut led to gains overnight,” Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.
In comments widely reported yesterday, Abdullah El-Badri, Secretary-General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said he expected the cartel to trim output in 2015 by about 500,000 barrels per day, from 30 million to 29.5 million.
The cartel is due to hold its next production meeting in Vienna on November 27.
In June, OPEC had agreed to keep the production at 30 million barrels a day, saying that while demand was picking up, downside risks to the global economy “remain unchecked’’.
Since the June meeting, oil prices have been in fairly steady retreat, with Brent falling to a two-year low Monday owing partly to concerns about demand in China.
US crude oil stockpiles
McCarthy said dealers are standing on the sidelines ahead of the release of the latest official US stockpiles data later today.
Analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires expect crude reserves to have dropped by 1.2 million barrels on average in the week to September 12.

India is like home market for us now: Opera CEO Lars BoilesenPrint
The Opera team celebrates 50 million users at a Gurgaon mall on November 9. CEO Lars Boilesen is seen in the foreground to the left.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 3:52 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 6:20 pm
Despite being one of the first web browsers that the world got used to Opera has been able to stay ahead of the game by implementing a mobile-first strategy that has now started showing dividends. With over 50 million of its 350 million plus users in India, the Norway-based software company claims to offer the cheapest access to Internet across the world. Opera Mini is now the third largest app in India after Facebook and Whatsapp. Excerpts from an interview with Opera Software CEO Lars Boilesen.
How important is India for you?
Just a few days ago we crossed 50 million monthly active users in India. It is clearly the biggest market for Opera Software. We can even say that this is our home market now. Half our users here are using Android and it shows how fast growing the market is… our goal is to reach 100 million. Only 20 per cent of the population here is connected and our vision since we came to India in 2006 has been to connect the unconnected.
Is the market similar to other geographies?
It is very similar to all other emerging markets, but growing much faster. These are all young, fast growing and mobile-first markets. People in these markets are getting connected for the first time through the mobile phone. And this just syncs with the Opera vision as we allow them to open a Facebook account even on a feature phone. We offer the same speeds for users across all device categories.
In India, is the growth happening on entry level phones?
Yes. We see a lot of growth happening on devices of Indian manufactures like Micromax, Karbonn and Lava. We have strategic partnerships with them and they are a big part of our success here. They pre-install Opera in many of their devices and that is a very efficient delivery model for us.
You said India is like your home market. But is that true in case of revenue also?
No. In terms of revenue India is not the largest. But I think we need to look at the future here. We want to invest in India and be here for 20 years later too. We want to invest in the future, in this great country’s potential. It is not like we don’t make money here. We reinvest all the money we make here and add a bit more. We have multiple revenue streams, but at the end of the day as CEO I want to reach out to all the Indians who are not connected. That is why we are an important part of Internet.org and have been compressing data for users for so many years.
Are you looking at different monetisation models for markets like India?
We have some good partners here continued…

Karachi Stock Exchange hits all time high at 31 332 pointsThe Karachi Stock Exchange hit an all time high of 31,332 points today signalling growing confidence of foreign and local investors in the strong performance of the Pakistan’s economy.
In an all time high, the KSE 100-share index gained 402.25 points to hit 31,332 points.
Financial analysts said that the KSE index moving past the 31,000 points mark was a very positive sign for the economy.
Earlier on November 5, the benchmark KSE index of 100 shares closed at 30,593 points, while throughout last week the KSE index has shown gains due to increased trading of shares.
The previous peak of 30,474 points had come in July, but the exchange plunged in August after the protests and sit-ins by opposition leaders Imran Khan and cleric Allama Tahirul Qadri in Islamabad.
“The surge today shows that the recent steps taken by the government for economic gains, plus the approval by the IMF last week in Dubai to release the last tranche of loans, have boosted confidence of the investors,” market analyst, Intikhab said.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to release the additional USD 1.1 billion aid to Pakistan after its December review, saying it was satisfied with the strong fiscal performance of the country during the last financial year and its improving economic indicators.
“Economic indicators (of Pakistan) are improving, with growth expected to reach 4.3 per cent in fiscal year (FY) 2014/2015, inflation on a downward trajectory, and credit to the private sector expanding at a robust pace,” the IMF had said in a statement last week.
Ratings agency Moody’s had also upgraded the country’s outlook to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’ in July, citing its improving external liquidity position and commitment to reforms.

NEW DELHI: Inability to cut through the rail bureaucracy and failure to come up with a roadmap on how he was planning to attract FDI into the crucial infrastructure ministry cost Sadananda Gowda his job in the railway ministry, according to sources in Rail Bhavan.
ET learns that in the last meeting with all the Cabinet ministers, PM Modi had politely but firmly reminded the mild-mannered Gowda that his ministry had little to show in terms of achievements. Gowda struggled to cut through the wellentrenched bureaucracy. Among the major tasks given by the PM was to attract FDI in railway. "Gowda could not even prepare a basic roadmap of the same in over five months," said a railway official .
"The PM had wanted implementation of Wi-Fi scheme for designated trains and stations but nothing had moved on that. Same was the case with the bullet train project," the official said. The feedback from Modi's appointee in the ministry, BJP's IT cell in-charge Arvind Gupta , too was not exactly in favour of the minister, sources told ET.
"Railways is a humongous ministry with a shrewd bureaucracy having deep roots. The system of the Railway Board, the various departments and the inter-departmental rivalries, it is not easy to manage it. Gowda was not the man for it. We could see that it was easy to take him for a ride," a railway board member told ET. Sadananda Gowda even failed to get the several critical vacancies filled in the railways.

NEW DELHI: Harsh Vardhan had no inkling that he was being shifted from the health ministry even on Sunday night, though he had met party president Amit Shah a few hours ahead of the formal announcement of portfolios, according to his political aides and friends. "To remove him from a portfolio that is his forte means that the PM was unhappy with him. Why would you embarrass someone like this before sending him back to state politics?" said a BJP leader in Delhi considered close to Harsh Vardhan.
His 'slow delivery' on the Modi's key promise of National Health Assurance — affordable preventive checkups, free drugs and insurance for all — diagnostic checkups was a big factor.
Even though an expert panel appointed by Vardhan for drafting the broad contours of the National Health Assurance had submitted its report on September 15, his ministry did not make any progress in finalising the proposal.
His aides say Vardhan was let down by the bureaucracy. RSS wasn't too happy with him either as they felt they lost communication with him after he was appointed as minister. "The lack of access rubbed RSS the wrong way," a BJP state leader said.

NEW DELHI: For the last five months, MoS for Home Kiren Rijiju was the de facto minister for Department of Northeast Region (Doner), with NE groups flocking to him than VK Singh, who lost the portfolio on Sunday.
"They (north-east) relate to him (Rijiju)...they see him as their man in Delhi," a source close to Rijiju told ET on Monday, admitting that it came as a surprise that Doner was not added to Rijiju's workload after Singh was divested of the same.
"The fact is that Singh had no time for Doner or meeting northeast groups regularly. Hence, they flocked to Rijiju who threw his doors open to them," the source said. The MP from Arunachal Pradesh has a busy schedule with 40-50 appointments in a day, mostly with groups from the northeast who come to him with requests and schemes many of which have little to do with his profile as the junior minister for home .
From 10 am till 7 or even 8 pm, Rijiju has visitors. Major announcements for northeast have come from Rijiju.
In Sunday's reshuffle, VK Singh lost Doner to MoS for personnel Jitendra Singh . "I will do justice to Doner...the northeast is a priority area for the PM," he said. However, Rijiju's workload at the MHA is set to be lightened with a second MoS joining on Tuesday in Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary.

Shriram Transport gains 3.9 pct, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services gains 2.4 pct.
IDFC gains 2.6 pct, LIC Housing Finance up 1.6 pct.

Star couple David and Victoria Beckham’s son Romeo has been paid 45,000 pounds for a day’s work as a luxury brand’s model.
Romeo, 12, was paid the equivalent of 93.75 pounds a minute for an eight-hour day for the time he spent on set, which puts him among the world’s highest-earning models, reported Contactmusic.
Other models, who have endorsed the brand, feel it will be difficult to match Romeo’s rate of pay. “Romeo has set some hard steps to follow in,” actor-model Jamie Campbell Bower said.
Burberry, for its part, is able to point to the fact that the advertising campaign has received more publicity than is usual, largely because they’ve hired the son of one of the world’s most famous and stylish couples.

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI | BENGALURU: Flipkart and Snapdeal may be soaking up the cash as buoyant investors place a high value on the potential of Indian internet commerce companies but for most of the country's technology startups, big bucks and skyrocketing valuations are only a distant dream. Young ventures in India are typically valued less than peers in Silicon Valley, China or Israel due to a paucity of capital and investors unwilling to grant high valuations in a market where only a very few companies have delivered strong returns so far.
"In Silicon Valley, there is a lot of capital available because in the early stage, the managers of the capital are entrepreneurs and not investment bankers," said Sharad Sharma, angel investor and cofounder of iSpirt, a software product industry think tank.
The lack of a robust merger and acquisition market that can deliver strong exits is also pegging back the value of technology startups in the country. For instance, in the United States and Israel, startup valuations increase nearly fivefold from the time of investment to when a venture is acquired; this boosts morale of early investors. In contrast, the ratio in India stands at 0.4, according to a report by iSpirt and investment firm Signal Hill.
However such wariness disappears when it comes to investments in India's booming internet commerce sector. Here, investors are jostling to reward what they term as "potential for growth" in a market where online retail alone is expected to be worth $6 billion (Rs 36,000 crore) by 2015, according to consultancy Gartner "Foreign investors don't want to miss the bus like they did in China about 4-5 years ago, when valuations were investible enough. India is that juncture now," said Rahul Khanna, founder of Trifecta Capital Partners, a venture debt firm.
Online retailer Flipkart gained a valuation of $7 billion in July with the company expecting to sell goods worth $4 billion this fiscal. Restaurant listing portal Zomato was valued at about $165 million and its revenue is expected at $16.5 million in fiscal 2015. A big part of the reason that Zomato is so attractive is that it is expanding aggressively overseas through acquisitions. This is a rare aggression on a global scale by an Indian startup, and there is also the India market which is quite large anyway.
Experts are of the view that ecommerce companies which have attracted investor attention in the recent past could come under pressure as demand grows for profitability.
"The value of these companies will be based on their operating margins that are increasingly shrinking," said Aswath Damodaran who teaches corporate finance and equity valuation at the Stern School of Business in New York. For early-stage ventures, arriving at a proper valuation is also more difficult as traditional methods such as discounted cash flow, earnings per share or the revenue multiple are often tough to apply.
For instance, realty portal Housing.com raised angel funding based on estimated costs which included rentals and salaries. "We worked backwards by calculating valuation when we first raised Rs 50 lakh as angel capital," said Advitiya Sharma, co-founder at Housing.com. The company subsequently raised Rs 115 crore from institutional investors, this year. Entrepreneurs for their part are quite enthused by foreign investors who are foraying into India for the first time, as they can now tap into a far larger pool of investors, most of whom are quite different from the Indian venture capitalists in terms of risk appetite, price sensitivity and capital depth.
"Most of these new benchmarks in terms of valuations are being set by (them). So for Indian entrepreneurs who have crossed the chasm in any sense, it is great news,' said Sumanth Raghavendra, founder of app maker Deck.in who raised $600,000 from investors in December 2013.
Early-stage investing is largely driven by perception and 'gut feeling.' Investors will vouch that valuing a company in its early stages is more art than science.
Unable to find an Indian company that was developing an advertisement optimisation platform similar to the one developed by his startup Ad Pushup, Ankit Oberoi came up with an interesting method to pitch valuation of his company to angel investors. He calculated the savings each of his clients was making by using his free product and then imposed a 25% commission on it. This he termed as 'potential' revenues.
To his surprise, about 14 investors bought Oberoi's pitch. Last week they investedRs 3.8 crore despite the fact that his company is yet to make a single rupee in revenue.
"The model is unique and potentially scalable to a large business," said Amit Ranjan, cofounder of Slideshare, and an angel investor in AdPushup. Ranjan himself sold his startup Slideshare to Linkedin in 2012 for $119 million.
"Valuation is a function of supply and demand of capital. When there are deals and not enough capital, the investor wins. And when there is more money and fewer deals, entrepreneur wins," said iSpirt's Sharma.

Indian e-commerce market to reach $20 billion next year: ReportAmazon
(Online travel constituted…)
NEW DELHI: The e-commerce market in the country is expected to grow 37 per cent to reach $20 billion by next year on the back of growing internet population and increased online shoppers, a report has said.
"E-commerce in India is a $11 billion market, and is estimated to reach $20 billion by 2015, growing at a CAGR of 37 per cent over 2013-15," Motilal Oswal Securities said in its report on e-commerce.
The research firm said their are multiple enablers for this growth which include increase in the number of internet users and an increased proportion of online shoppers within those users, growth in the per-shopper transaction value and continued flow of capital by willing investors.
The report said currently online travel dominates the e-commerce market but in the future, e-tailing will drive the growth.
Online travel constituted 71 per cent of the e-commerce market in India, followed by e-tailing (16 per cent). Travel has grown at a CAGR of 32 per cent over 2009-13.
"However, going forward, e-tailing will be the biggest growth driver, with expected CAGR of over 60 per cent to $7 billion in 2016 from $1.7 billion in 2013. Within e-tailing, fashion is likely to be the driving segment," it said.
Fashion was $559 million in 2013, and estimates peg the growth in fashion e-tailing to anywhere between $3 billion and $6 billion by 2016.
The research firm said heavy discount on online sales is a direct reflection of the industry's competitive intensity.
"The amount of money raised by Flipkart , lately Snapdeal , and that committed by Amazon is all yet to be invested, indicating that we may not be anywhere near the end of round-the-clock discount seasons at online stores," it added.

Flipkart set to raise $1.5 billion in another round of mega fund-raisingAmazon
(The company has raised a…)
BENGALURU: India's largest online retailer, Flipkart, could begin another round of mega fund-raising as it expands its product range catering to a widening base of customers. The Bengaluru-based firm will seek funding of about $1.5 billion and has begun shortlisting potential investors, according to two people with direct knowledge of the developments. "Talks haven't begun yet and Flipkart is looking to target only a few investors that they want on board," said one of the two persons directly involved in the process. "The fund-raising process is expected to begin in January 2015."
Flipkart, when contacted, declined comment on its fund-raising and investment plans. The company has raised a total of $1.2 billion this year and has just completed a round of festival sales marked by steep discounts. "At the pace at which it is making investments, Flipkart will deploy most of the funds it has raised by around mid-next year," said the source.
Discounting still accounts for a chunk of Flipkart's monthly costs, with promotions costing it at least Rs 70 crore each month, according to a person who works with Flipkart at a strategic level.
The company has also identified very specific areas to pump in money to ensure its goal of doubling in size by next year.
Post the blockbuster festive season sales of October, when the company shipped around 80 lakh items versus 50 lakh on average, the company has revised its internal targets to reach sales of $4 billion by the end of the current fiscal, according to sources.
A major area of focus is increasing the categories in which they have leadership. "It has built a lead in fashion with the Myntra acquisition. The same push needs to happen across categories," said Manish Saigal , managing director at advisory firm Alvarez and Marsal.
"Furniture and packaged food will be launched very soon," said a person directly involved in the process. The teams are being built for these product categories.
Rival Amazon India recently launched its gourmet and specialty foods category with over 155 Indian and imported brands. Amazon is yet to launch furniture. Snapdeal, on the other hand, already has a presence in these segments.
"There are aggressive existing competitors and large offline players could come in very soon. It makes sense to extend its leadership now," said Arvind Singhal , chairman of retail advisory Technopak.
The seven-year-old company will launch a wider range of lifestyle products and consumer durables. It already has its range of tablets and digital accessories (Digiflip), apparel (Flippd) and home appliances and personal healthcare products such as sandwich makers and hair dryers (Citron).
According to a person directly involved with the process, Flipkart will put more marketing muscle behind in-house brands.
"We have seen how Myntra's inhouse brands have performed and scaled. That is what will be done with the new brands."
For Myntra, its portfolio of about 10 in-house brands accounts for about 20% of overall sales. Its biker brand Roadster is already a Rs 100-crore brand.
Flipkart's stake acquisition in consumer appliances service provider Jeeves Consumer Services should be seen in this light. "When they have their own brand of appliances, they will have to handle servicing, warranties and other such issues.
They can't do this all on their own," said one of the persons who spoke to ET on this matter. A Flipkart spokesperson said through this (strategic) partnership, Jeeves will provide exclusive value-added services in ecommerce to Flipkart customers across India.
"Flipkart and other marketplaces will have to invest humungous amounts into logistics and fulfilment if they want to cover even rural areas," said Technopak's Singhal. Flipkart has a delivery network of about 300 locations and is intending to expand its reach to even small towns.
In each of these areas, Flipkart is also looking at acquisitions.
When Flipkart appointed former Canaan Partners associate Nishant Verman as its M&A head earlier this year, its HR head Mekin Maheshwari said inorganic growth is a strong component of the vision to make Flipkart a $100-billion company. Snapdeal and Amazon have also made their intentions clear to acquire companies in areas ranging from mobile technology to payments.
"The over-arching theme will be acquisitions as they try to bridge existing gaps and scale up faster," said Alvarez and Marsal's Saigal.

Govt asks internet service cos to block pornography sitesGovernment asks internet service companies to block pornography sites, upgrade systems

(Prasad said porn is legal…)
BENGALURU | DELHI: Blocking Internet porn may be next to impossible. But the Indian government is going to try anyhow.
The plan is to begin by creating a list of pornography sites, especially those hosting child porn, and provide that to Internet service providers (ISPs) to block. And then, to ensure that largescale blocking does not slow Internet access, service providers will be asked to upgrade their infrastructure. The Internet and Mobile Association of India has been asked to curate the list.
At a meeting chaired by Telecom & IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and attended by top government officials in September, the "problem of porn" was discussed and the minister directed the departments of IT and telecom to work together to improve "blocking infrastructure" at the ISP level.
Prasad said although porn is legal in other countries, it needs to be viewed in the "context of Indian culture and moral obligation towards society".
The meeting of the Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee was triggered by a recent directive from the Supreme Court , which asked the government to place the issue before the committee. The committee has convened just five times since it was formed in 2000. The apex court is hearing a petition filed by lawyer Kamlesh Vasvani , seeking to ban porn as it leads to "activities like rape, harassment, molestations of women". At the last hearing, held on August 29, the government said that filtering porn was not practical.
The department of telecom had said large-scale blocking of websites could slow the Internet down, unless services providers upgrade their infrastructure.
"The problem is that you are veering down a slippery ground if you try to do this, installing filters and all," said Prasanth Sugathan, counsel for the Software Freedom Law Centre. Such blocks have been ineffective in countries such as the UK. However, in China, where the ban on online pornography is strictly enforced, it is another story, as that country has people dedicated to monitoring content, he said.
An extreme step would be to follow what countries such as North Korea do. Internet is regulated heavily and domestic Internet users are served by a sole provider with limited access to the global Internet. "But the question is, should we be moving towards that or we should be respecting Internet freedom," said Sugathan.
Blocking porn will not be an easy task by any means. According to one estimate by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, there are more than 40 million porn websites around the world and most of them operate outside India where porn is legal. Moreover, there are many ways including the use of proxies to get around to blocked websites.
For instance, in 2009, the Indian government banned a website which hosted porn-toon portraying the sexual adventures of a housewife. Content from the site is still widely accessible.
The use of the "https" protocol, which encrypts data transmission, makes it tough to block pornography. At the meeting in September, the IT department suggested the government start with a list of child pornography sites that can be obtained from other countries where it is blocked strictly.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also wants the government to take steps to block Internet pornography.
"A solution may need to be worked out to prevent availability of pornography on the Internet considering the cultural sensitivities of the country," Arvind Gupta, head of BJP's information technology cell, conveyed to the committee, according to the minutes of the meeting reviewed by ET.
Telecom Secretary Rakesh Garg pointed out at the meeting that the latency of Internet access would go up if a large number of websites are blocked. India already has the lowest average Internet speed among most countries. Garg said the ISP infrastructure needs to be upgraded to deal with large-scale website blocking.
The committee comprises the minister for information technology and top officials from the ministries of legal affairs, commerce, home affairs, defence, the Central Bureau of Investigation as well as representatives from non-government bodies such as Nasscom , Confederation of Indian Industry and Federation of the Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry.
Legally, viewing pornography in private is allowed in India although hosting and transmitting porn is punishable. Further, according to the Information Technology Act, browsing, downloading, creation and publication of child porn is illegal.
"Child pornography and pornography cannot be said in the same breath. The government has very firm legislation against it," said Vidya Reddy, director of Tulir-Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse.
The government also suggested that NGOs will have to play a big role in creating awareness and sensitising the ill-effects of porn.

Bullying on campus to get punishable act in schools

(The panel, comprising school…)
NEW DELHI: The government is actively considering a proposal to make bullying on campus a punishable act in schools after an expert panel headed by the chairman of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) flagged it as a "critical" problem in a report submitted to the Union human resource development ministry recently.
There is already a no-tolerance policy toward ragging in colleges as directed by the Supreme Court. However, there's no such code for bullying in schools. According to sources, the expert committee has expressed a strong "need to develop an anti-bullying policy and effective strategies, including both preventive and intervention measures".
The panel, comprising school principals, psychologists and education secretaries of different states, was set up during the UPA government . Its report, submitted last month, proposes punishments for bullying including oral and written warnings, fines, suspensions for a specified period, withholding of examination results and expulsion from school in extreme cases.
The committee also wants the government to direct all schools to form an anti-bullying committee and have a fulltime counselor on campus, launch a national helpline to report cases and set up an independent monitoring agency for such complaints. The panel has also recommended that schools allow victims to report cases anonymously.
Although there isn't any formal definition of bullying in schools, the ways in which students are harassed include teasing, name calling, physical intimidation and gossip. For an anti-bullying policy, the government will have to define the act, as it's done for ragging in colleges. School bullying usually goes unreported but instances have surfaced recently on social media, creating a furore. In March this year, a phone video showed a group of class VI students physically and verbally abusing another from class VII at a prominent south Delhi school. Such intimidation is pervasive across age groups, according to an expert.
"Schools have started waking up to the problem of bullying, but they need to articulate a policy to clarify what is acceptable and what isn't. Bullying doesn't happen only in senior classes, it's also prevalent in primary sections. Punishment is not a solution. It's important to have a fulltime counselor on campus to find out why a child is bullying others," said child psychologist Aparna S Gharpure .

No direct entry into SC: Government to weed out non-practising lawyersadvocate
(Bar Council of India makes…)
NEW DELHI: The Bar Council of India has revised rules to stop fresh lawyers from practicing in the Supreme Court right away. They will have to spend two years in a trial court and three years in High Court before they become eligible to practice in the Supreme Court. The revised norms will restrict license to practise law only for five years, after which it may be renewed after a review.
The Certificate of Practice and Renewal Rules, 2014, aims to give "due weightage and credence to experience" for practising in higher courts and also "weed out" advocates who have left practice.
"There is an urgent need for laying down some conditions for practicing law in different courts so as to give due weightage and credence to experience.
Before an advocate could practice law in higher courts, there is need that he is exposed to real court experience in lower courts/trial courts. This will help in integrating the whole judicial system from the perspective of the bar," as per the statement of objects and reasons for the new notified rules.
It has also been mentioned that concerns have been raised by State Bar Councils and Bar Council of India that trend of advocates switching over to "other professions or services or business" without any information to the State Bar Council has reached "alarming proportions".
The statement says this trend is "endangering" the legal profession as a whole.
"It has also made a dent in its sanctity and standards. Names of such advocates continue to be included in the 'roll of advocates' being maintained by the State Bar Councils, notwithstanding the fact that they have left the legal profession or have since died," the statement says.
All practicing advocates will hence have file an application for renewal of their license every five year, in advance of six months, before the validity period of "Certificate of Practice" or of its renewal, expires and the same will be vetted by the Bar Council.

TEL AVIV: Responding favourably to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' initiative, his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu has told visiting Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh that his country is keen to take advantage of the move.
Netanyahu said that Israel is ready and willing to discuss transfer and development of technologies with India.
"Israeli industries, including the defence industries, could 'make in India' and thereby reduce costs of manufacturing products and systems developed by Israel", the Israeli Premier said.
The Israeli leader also expressed willingness to send a delegation from Israeli industries to visit India to explore manufacturing opportunities in different sectors.
Singh, in this context, proposed exploring jointly third country markets in Africa and Latin America, where Indian industry has a strong presence.
He earlier made a strong pitch for Israeli industries, including those from the defence sector, to take advantage of the investment friendly policies adopted by the new government with special reference to the 'Make in India' campaign.
Launched in September, the 'Make in India' is a major national program designed to facilitate investment, foster innovation, enhance skill development and build best-in-class manufacturing infrastructure.

Fixing up timelines for concluding negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement, exchange of sentenced prisoners, cooperation on narcotics control and pacts on tourism and cultural cooperation are on the anvil during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bilateral meeting with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott in Canberra.
The Prime Minister will be in Australia for a 5-day visit from November 14-18, during which a number of agreements will be signed and announcements made on initiatives.
The two premiers will seek to speed up negotiations and fix timelines on concluding negotiations on the bilateral Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), also known as the free trade agreement (FTA), to boost bilateral trade, an official said Monday.
The CECA aims to further liberalise and broaden the base of merchandise trade, remove non-tariff barriers and encourage investments.
Talks were first started for the CECA in 2011 and so far five rounds of negotiations have been held.
PM Modi will have delegation level talks with Abbott and address the parliament in Canberra, have political, business and community meetings in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne where Abbott will host dinner.
A strong delegation of CEOs will accompany the prime minister to highlight the economic interests, said Secretary (East) Anil Wadhwa at a briefing in the national capital.
Wadhwa said the negotiations on the Administrative Arrangements for Civil Nuclear Energy were proceeding smoothly and it would open the way for trade in uranium with Australia. Australia has shown interest to engage in the country's mining sector, he added.
"On the economic front, trade in goods declined from US$17.5 billion in 2011-12, to $12.5 billion in 2013-14. To address this, we seek to conclude a mutually beneficial CECA at an early date, hold a Make in India Show 2015 in Australia and reconstitute CEO Forum to step up economic engagement," the secretary said.
"We are also looking at greater flow of services, including IT, investments, tourism," Wadhwa added.
On security issues, Wadhwa said both countries had a good working relations in counter-terrorism and transnational crimes. "We have finalised text of Agreement on Transfer of Sentenced Persons and MOU on Combating Narcotics which will help our common efforts," he said.
During the Australian PM's visit to the country in September, both sides inked four agreements, including on civil nuclear cooperation, sports, skills and water.

Promoter pledges fall for first time in seven quartersFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Making most of the market rally, the promoters of BSE-500 companies have reduced the percentage of their pledged shares for the first time in 7 quarters. As on September quarter, the percentage of promoters’ shares pledged within BSE-500 universe stood at 11.76%, from 12.01% in June quarter, as per Capitaline data.
Experts attribute this trend-reversal to the surge in the markets. “The rally has shored up the value of the company’s shares. Subsequently, the drawing power of the promoters’ shares has gone up. The promoters are asking lenders to either raise their borrowing limits to match rise in the value of the shares or allow their shares to be released,” said SP Tulsian, an independent analyst. However, shares pledged with banks as collateral for working capital are unlikely to be released, he added.

The BSE Sensex has gained 31.67%, while the CNX Nifty has gained 32.36% YTD Infrastructure companies have been the major beneficiaries. From 96% in June quarter, HDIL’s promoters released all their pledged shares in September quarter. YTD, the stock has gained 63.12%.
The logistics player Gateway Distriparks has seen its pledged shares fall to 25.83% in September quarter from 49.43% in June quarter. The stock has gained 120.41% YTD.
For construction company NCC, the percentage of promoters’ pledged shares have dropped by 19 percentage points in September quarter. YTD, shares are up 179.11%.
Additionally, Aban Offshore’s shares have gained 66.39% in YTD, while the percentage of promoters’ pledged shares have fallen by 11 percentage points in September quarter. Indiabulls Power’s promoters had 100% of their shares pledged as on June quarter. However, that ratio has fallen to 81% with shares gaining 51.22% in YTD.
However, experts don’t see the fall in percentage of pledged shares as a reliable indicator of balance sheet improvement. “The improvement in gearing will depend upon the borrowing programme of individual companies. If borrowings are large, then further fall in the percentage of pledged shares is unlikely,” said Deven Choksey, MD of KR Choksey Securities.

Data Tariffs May Fall 20% With Reliance Jio s Entry: FitchNew Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm's entry in the telecom space will intensify competition and may bring data tariffs down by at least 20 per cent, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.
It, however, said no tariff wars are expected as witnessed during the 2009-2013 period.
"The likely entry of new telco (telecom company) Reliance Jio, which is a part of Reliance Industries Ltd in 1H15 will intensify competition in the data segment, and may cause data tariffs to decline by at least 20 per cent," Fitch said in its 2015 outlook for Indian telecommunications services.
Reliance Industries had announced that it would launch commercial 4G telecom service of RJio in 2015 entailing investment of Rs 70,000 crore.
Fitch said Jio will focus largely on data and may have a limited impact on the incumbents' core voice business, given a weak "voice-over-LTE" technology ecosystem and lack of affordable 4G-compatible handsets in India.
"We do not foresee a re-run of the tariff wars of 2009-2013, which led to a severe decline in industry tariffs," Fitch said.
The rating agency expects the top four Indian telecom firms - Bharti Airtel Limited (Bharti; 'BBB-/Stable'), Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications - to increase their revenue market share to around 83 per cent by 2015 from the current 79 per cent in the $30-billion industry.
"Industry revenue will grow by at a mid-single-digit rate in 2015, driven by data services. The top four telcos' 2015 average operating EBITDA margin will be mostly unchanged at 32-33 per cent (2014: 32 per cent) as a decline in data tariffs will offset a gradual rise in voice tariffs," it said.
Fitch said the top four telecom companies will generate a minimal free cash flow (FCF) margin due to higher capex and flat Ebitda; the 2015 industry capex/revenue ratio could rise as fast-growing data traffic requires supporting investment.
As of 2:28 p.m., shares in Reliance Industries were trading at Rs 982.25 apiece on the BSE, up 1.32 per cent from the previous close.

China doesn t warm up to Putin wrapping shawl around Xi s wifeChina doesn't warm up to Putin wrapping shawl around Xi's wife

Russia's President Vladimir Putin (right) helps put a blanket on Peng Liyuan, the wife of China's President Xi Jinping, as they watch a lights and fireworks show to celebrate the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in Beijing. (Reuters)
It was a warm gesture on a chilly night when Vladimir Putin wrapped a shawl around the wife of Xi Jinping while the Chinese President chatted with US President Barack Obama. The only problem: Putin came off looking gallant, the Chinese summit host gauche and inattentive.
 
Worse still were off-colour jokes that began to circulate about the real intentions of the divorced Russian President — a heartthrob among many Chinese women for his macho, man-of-action image.
 
That was too much for the Chinese authorities.
 
The incident at a performance linked to this week's Asia-Pacific summit originally was broadcast on state broadcaster CCTV and spread online as a forwarded video. But it was soon scrubbed clean from the Chinese internet, reflecting the intense control authorities exert over any material about top leaders while also pointing to cultural differences over what's considered acceptable behavior in public.
 
"China is traditionally conservative on public interaction between unrelated men and women, and the public show of consideration by Putin may provide fodder for jokes, which the big boss probably does not like," said Beijing-based historian and independent commentator Zhang Lifan.
 
Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan, was once a popular folk singer more famous than her husband, and in contrast to her predecessors she has taken on a much more public role, prominently joining her husband on trips abroad as part of China's soft power push to seek global status commensurate with its economic might.
 
Propaganda officials have built the image of Xi and his wife as a loving couple. Photos of Xi shielding his wife from rain on a state visit, picking flowers for her, or simply holding her hand have circulated widely on China's social media, prompting much oohing and aahing.
 
"When the president personally held up the umbrella for the madam, it complies with the international norm of respecting women," blogger Luo Qingxue wrote on the news site for the party-run newspaper People's Daily last year after Xi was seen holding an umbrella over himself and Peng on a state visit to Trinidad and Tobago.
 
But Putin messed up the script Monday night while Xi chatted with the American president.
 
In the video, Peng stood up, politely accepted the gray shawl or blanket offered by Putin, and thanked him with a slight bow. But she soon slipped it off and put on a black coat offered by her own attendant.
 
It spawned a flurry of commentary on China's social media before censors began removing any mention of the incident.
 
Li Xin, director of Russian and central Asian studies at Shanghai Institute for International Studies, said Putin was just being a proper Russian and did nothing out-of-line diplomatically.
 
"It's a tradition in Russia for a man of dignity to respect ladies on public occasions, and in a cold country like Russia, it is very normal that a gentleman should help ladies take on and off their coats," Li said. "But the Chinese may not be accustomed to that."

NSE Nifty ends at new record high; BSE Sensex gains 35 pts in volatile tradeFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
The BSE Sensex today gained 35 points in a volatile trade while the NSE Nifty settled at record closing high of 8,362.65 points on continued foreign funds inflows ahead of inflation and IIP data tomorrow.
The 50-share Nifty continued its record-setting run for the second straight session and ended up by 18.40 points, or 0.22 per cent, at all time high of 8,362.65. It shuttled between 8,378.70 and 8,321.85 in day trade.
The BSE barometer Sensex opened on a strong footing and rose to intra-day high of 27,996.92.
But later it succumbed to profit-booking at near record levels and touched a low of 27,790.40 before settling at 27,910.06, a gain of 35.33 points, or 0.13 per cent, over previous close. The 30-share index had closed at record high of 27,915.88 on November 5.
A positive momentum after government’s reforms process and a firming trend at global markets buoyed the trading sentiment, brokers said. Global crude prices dropping to four-year low also helped the positive momentum, they added.
Brent crude for the December delivery eased 22 cents to four-year low of USD 82.12.
Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth Rs 355.30 crore yesterday, according to the stock exchanges’ data.
However, profit-booking at some counters ahead of inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September to be released tomorrow, slowed down the rally to some extent.
Of 30 Sensex stocks, 16 scrips led by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, HDFC Bank, GAIL, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, L&T, Tata Power, Tata Steel, TCS and Sun Pharma gained.
On the other hand, Infosys, ITC Ltd, Bharti Airtel, BHEL, Coal India, Dr Reddy’s, Hero MotoCorp, Wipro and Sesa Sterlite finished lower.
Sectorwide, the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 1.05 per cent, followed by Banking index by 0.74 per cent and Auto index by 0.68 per cent.
Indicating firm sentiments, the breadth of the market was positive with BSE midcap index rising 0.72 per cent and smallcap index by 0.24 per cent.
Indian shares edge higher ahead of key retail inflation data
(Reuters) Indian shares edged higher on Tuesday as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank  rose on hopes lower retail inflation data would lead to early interest rate cuts, although profit-taking prevented the indexes from hitting further record highs.
Meanwhile, non-banking finance companies like Housing Development Finance Corporation also rose after the central bank unveiled rules on bad loans and capital requirements that came largely along expected lines.
Traders say volumes will remain muted until India releases data on Wednesday on retail inflation, which is expected to slow to a record low of 5.80 percent in October, according to a Reuters poll.
That is expected to intensify calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India at its next policy review on Dec. 2.
“Market is discounting a fall in inflation and a resultant decrease in interest rates,” said Deven Choksey, managing director at K R Choksey Securities.
The benchmark BSE index rose 0.13 percent to end at 27,910.06.     The broader NSE index rose 0.22 percent to end at 8,362.65, also marking a record closing high.
Rate-sensitive stocks led the gains on hopes lower retail inflation data would enable the central bank to go for early rate cuts.
ICICI Bank ended up 1.6 percent while HDFC Bank  gained 0.4 percent.
Among state-run banks, Bank of Baroda rose 2.7 percent while Punjab National Bank advanced 3.4 percent.
Some auto stocks gained with Mahindra and Mahindra  rising 2.4 percent while Larsen and Toubro gained 1.1 percent.
Non-banking finance companies also rose. India raised the minimum capital requirement for so-called shadow banks and tightened rules on deposits and bad loans on Monday, but the rules were largely within expectations.
Housing Development Finance Corporation gained 1.2 percent, while IDFC ended 2.7 percent higher.
Shriram Transport gained 4.9 percent, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services rose 1.1 percent.
However, among decliners, Jet Airways fell 2.5 percent on profit-taking after Monday’s 6.9 percent surge after September-quarter results.

ISRO worried over satellites  safety due to space debrisISRO chief raises concern over satellites' safety due to space debris

ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan on Tuesday raised concern over the safety of satellites due to space debris and batted for a comprehensive space policy for the country.
At a time when space assets are becoming part and parcel of daily life, its safety must be ensured, said Radhakrishnan, who is also the secretary of the Department of Space.
"There are so many thousands communication satellites and less than 100 various other types of satellites. What happens to those elements after their work is over. This is a new area of study.
"Are we able to catalogue them? Are we able to predict their movement? Are we able to see whether our actual satellites are safe from them? How do we move them to safety? If we can tackle that or if we can identify arrival of debris, a spacecraft can itself move out of the place," Radhakrishnan said.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman was delivering a lecture on 'Contribution of India's Space Programme in Nation Building' at Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis in the national capital.
He added that there are nearly 15,000-16,000 space debris scattered in the space.
"Debris are also created intentionally and also generated unintentionally. When we depend on space assets to be part and parcel of our lives, it is essential to ensure their safety.
He said efforts are being made at the international level to deal with this problem.
"There are groups in the international arena which are looking at the issue of intentional creation of space debris through guidelines and general arrangements. There are groups, experts looking at these debris and how to deal with it," he said.
Radhakrishnan also said that government was looking to have an overall space law for the country. "In January 2015, we are going to have a workshop on this. We are working with a Hyderabad-based institute and the International Institute of Space Law School," he said.
The ISRO chief said policies related to different aspects like space and remote sharing of remote sensing data was in place, but there was a need to have an overall policy.
"In the country, we have a policy on satellite, we have a SATCOM policy, which is there is on our website. For remote centre data dissemination, what kind of data can be given to which agency, we do have a policy and it is well known. An overall space law for the country is what we are trying to evolve. The workshop is supposed to provide light on the issue," he said.
Radhakrishnan said that when it comes to human space module and robotics India is not been able to make inroads as compared to other countries, but the country would master the art and the space agency is working towards it.
"India is making the beginning by looking at the difficult technology in this area. We are going to, by December 2014, have a test flight of our GSLV Mark III.
"It's a crew model we have prepared for the human space module. It's an unmanned crew model. As it enters the atmosphere we wish to know what happens to it and how does it stand," he said.

Alibaba says Singles Day shoppers spend USD 2 bn in first hourEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Alibaba said a record USD 2 billion of goods were sold in the first hour of its Singles Day shopping bonanza in China today, maintaining the day’s dominance as the world’s biggest retail event as it went global for the first time.
The e-commerce giant said that amount was more than a third of the USD 5.8 billion full-day sales recorded on the same day last year and analysts say this year will blow that out of the water.
Alibaba has been pushing November 11 as Singles Day — so named for the number of ones in the date — since 2009 as it looks to tap an expanding army of Internet shoppers in China, which has the world’s biggest online population.
Singles Day already surpassed major shopping festivals in the US in terms of transaction value last year, toppling the combined online sales of USD 3.7 billion recorded on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to an estimate by Internet analytics firm comScore.
The day was originally marketed as an “anti-Valentine’s Day” in China featuring hefty discounts to lure the country’s singletons and price-sensitive buyers.
It has been expanded globally this year to include overseas merchants and customers.
Within the first hour and 12 seconds, more than USD 2 billion) of deals were settled on both domestic and international retail marketplaces,
Alibaba said in a statement, adding that 45.7 percent of the transactions were made via mobile devices.
Headquartered in the eastern city of Hangzhou, Alibaba debuted its shares in New York two months ago with a record-breaking USD 25 billion initial public offering.
The giant operates China’s most popular online shopping platform, Taobao, which is estimated to hold more than 90 percent of the online market for consumer-to-consumer transactions.
The company does not sell products directly but acts as an electronic middleman. It also owns other marketplaces, including business-to-consumer platform Tmall.
More than 27,000 brands and merchants are participating in this year’s Singles Day, while consumers in more than 220 countries and regions will be able to join the 24-hour spending spree, the statement said.

Why is Delhi communally restiveWhy is Delhi communally restive?
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 12, 2014
First Published: 00:34 IST(12/11/2014) | Last Updated: 11:45 IST(12/11/2014)

Cramped living, fierce competition, limited resources and an ever-increasing population have given Delhi its famous short fuse. But as a city, it was never communally overwrought. But the past one month has changed that.
With elections set to be declared any given day, the city has seen a full-blown riot and four other instances of religion being at the centre of conflict.
How this has become the city’s reality is something its residents have failed to understand.
Trilokpuri, where the riots broke out on Diwali, is a place inured to violence. People from all parts of the country and religions live here. And clashes break out every other week.
The 1984 anti-Sikh riots had ravaged the settlement but since then, there was never a full-blown riot. In the recent years, fights have been contained with the help of local leaders and the police. But how did a riot as severe as the one on Diwali that shut the area for five continuous days could break out in an area like this has left residents with several burning questions. And there are no clear answers.
Bawana, Babarpur and Okhla, too are areas where periodic violence is common. Communal tension, however, is contained and usually resolved at the local level.
Is it then a mere coincidence that polarisation has knocked on Delhi’s doors just before elections are to be announced?
According to Harsh Mander, a noted social activist who has studied communal clashes extensively, riots and communal tensions follow a set template. 
“If left to themselves, people from different areas and communities tend to live together largely peacefully. It is political interference that causes stress and this is done in three stages,” he said.
He went on specify the three stages. “The first,” he said, “is when hatred for another community is generated around a sensitive issue. These issues are usually related to places of worship, love affairs, or instances like cow slaughter. Further deterioration of the situation is achieved by organising people in a collective on the basis of this hatred. Weapons, in many cases bricks and stones, are distributed. The third important thing is allowing it to fester for some time. Strict action is not taken at the first instance.” 
“A riot is a carefully manufactured product. With elections round the corner, this template is being followed. But we won’t see violence that will result in loss of life as that leads to sympathy. The violence should be just enough to let people forget other problems,” he added. 
The role of local politicians in flaring tensions has been highlighted by the police in their report to the ministry of home affairs. Members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have also alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been instrumental in igniting communal tensions.
“If it was one isolated incident, one would not have read into the motivations. But there are a number of other cases as well and there is a pattern to it. You are forced to look at the timing and context in which these things are happening. It doesn’t take too much to understand who is behind these things and who stands to gain from this polarisation,” said Yogendra Yadav, a senior leader of AAP.
“It happened in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana before the election and now it is happening here. The aim is to polarise voters. I don’t have any concrete proof, which I can hand over to the police,” he added.
The BJP too agrees that the clashes have been engineered to cause polarisation and blamed AAP for it.
“The incident at Trilokpuri was not communal to start with. It was given a communal colour. The other incidents are also part of a larger conspiracy by people who want to create fear psychosis in the minority community. AAP is provoking such incidents to keep its voter base intact,” said Ashish Sood, general secretary, Delhi BJP.
   
The police points out how a society which is densely populated by poor, multi-lingual, multi-regional and multi-religious people falls easy prey to communal tension. According to senior police officials, each group has its own priorities, sensibilities and response to social situations. Lack of resources, especially space, further accentuate the fight for limited resources for their community.

The BSE Sensex on Wednesday closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions. It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points.
It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in Tuesday's trade. A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours on Wednesday, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 per cent), Bajaj Auto (2.10 per cent), HDFC Ltd (1.12 per cent), SBI (0.17 per cent), ICICI Bank (1.33 per cent), HDFC Bank (0.44 per cent), ITC (1.55 per cent), Bharti Airtel (0.64 per cent), BHEL (0.88 per cent), Coal India (0.10 per cent), Dr Reddy's (0.58 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 per cent), Tata Motors (1.71 per cent) and TCS (0.55 per cent).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.

ASEAN-India Summit
(Modi's call came during…)
NAY PYI TAW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today invited Malaysian companies to come to India in a big way, saying there are a "lot of opportunities" for them since he is giving high importance to the ambitious 'Make in India' campaign.
Modi's call came during a bilateral meeting with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak at the Myanmar International Convention Centre on the sidelines of the 12th ASEAN-India summit on the second day of his ten-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
"I am giving lot of emphasis to makeinindia & want to invite Malaysian companies to come to India. There are lot of opportunities," Modi tweeted shortly after his meeting.
India has traditionally relied on investments from Japan, South Korea, Europe and the US.
Modi told Najib that Malaysia and India have worked together in the past and that the two countries can take this much further under his leadership.
Noting that Malaysia has worked a lot on affordable housing, Modi said its companies can work in this area since his government wants every Indian to have a home by 2022.
Modi and Najib also invited each other to visit their countries.
"Reformers meet, share thoughts on government and economic reforms," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin tweeted, referring to the Modi-Najib meeting.
With the total trade between the two countries being $12.3 billion in January to November 2013 period, against Malaysia-China trade of $95 billion, Indian officials said there is an excellent scope to augment the bilateral trade.
Today's meeting was the second interaction between the two leaders in three weeks.
Modi held a telephonic talk with Najib on October 21 during which he greeted the latter on Malaysia's election to UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for the 2015-16 term and expressed sympathy over the MH17 and MH370 air tragedies.
Najib had expressed gratitude for India's assistance in connection with these incidents.
Reiterating India's commitment to working for strengthening and expanding relations with Malaysia, Modi had appreciated the Malaysian PMO's Performance Management and Delivery Unit (PEMANDU) mechanism for monitoring of flagship projects and said he intends to incorporate its elements into India's systems.
Najib congratulated Modi on the emphatic victory in the parliamentary elections followed by Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana.
"These results, he said, were reflective of the trust and confidence that the people of India had in the leadership of Prime Minister Modi to take India forward on the path of growth and prosperity," according to an official statement.
Najib said a strong and prosperous India was important for Malaysia and ASEAN.

Gadkari wants seamless road travel across Sa...Nitin Gadkari pushes for seamless road travel across Saarc nations

Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has pushed the proposal of an umbrella agreement among all nations in the region for seamless movement of passengers and cargo across borders.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Barely weeks before the SAARC summit in Nepal, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has pushed the proposal of an umbrella agreement among all nations in the region for seamless movement of passengers and cargo across borders.
Gadkari, who is in Kathmandu, said that the proposed Saarc Motor Vehicle Agreement will be a path breaking endeavour.
A government release said the agreement is expected to be signed during the forthcoming visit of Prime Minister to Kathmandu.
Already the technical committee comprising members from all nations have agreed to the draft agreement. The road transport ministry has also circulated a cabinet proposal so that the item can be placed in Saarc agenda.
"There was a consensus among all member countries on the protocols to be followed for cross-border transport. Now we need to get it approved by the government heads at Saarc summit," a ministry official said.
Meanwhile, Nepal and India are set to sign bilateral agreement on the proposed daily bus service on three identified routes. Recently an Indian delegation was in Nepal to take forward this plan. Both sides had agreed on adopting the proposed Saarc Motor Vehicle Agreement. This agreement would facilitate Nepal-India bus services on reciprocal basis.
In addition to the regular bus service, the proposed agreement provides for movement of private vehicles and non-regular passenger vehicles across the border. Such private and non-regular passenger vehicles would be entitled to use all established entry and exit points in the agreed upon framework envisaged under the draft agreement.
"On the sidelines of the proposed Saarc Summit and signing of the Saarc/bilateral agreement we can strive to flag off the first bus from Kathmandu to New Delhi," Gadkari said.

Barack Obama's bid for new China ties can't quell tension
AP Nov 12, 2014, 10.34AM IST
(While Obama and Xi tackled…)
BEIJING: When Xi Jinping took the reins of a booming China two years ago, President Barack Obama saw an opportunity to remake America's relationship with the Asian power. But even after Obama's unusually robust efforts to forge personal ties with Xi, the two leaders are meeting in Beijing amid significant tensions, both old and new.
While Obama and Xi tackled sensitive matters like cybersecurity and human rights privately, they sought to accentuate areas of agreement in their public remarks. The countries jointly announced new goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, signaling that the world's largest economies were united in the need to tackle climate change. US officials said the two leaders were also likely to announce progress on deals to avert military confrontations in Pacific, where their aircraft have come into close contact.
As Obama and Xi opened talks Wednesday, the US president said cooperation between their nations ``can make important contributions to security and progress in the region and around the world.''
Since assuming the presidency in 2012, Xi has consolidated power, deepened China's provocative maritime disputes with its neighbors and stands accused of continuing cyberattacks against the United States. US officials have new concerns over the potential for a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and are warily watching Beijing strengthen ties with Moscow as the West distances itself from Russia.
For its part, Beijing remains skeptical of Obama's intentions in Asia, seeing his efforts to bolster US economic ties in the region as a way of countering China's rise. Obama's domestic political weakness, particularly following the Democrats' defeats in last week's midterm elections, has also sparked questions in China about whether the US president can deliver on potential international agreements.
Arriving on Wednesday at the Great Hall of the People, Obama walked with Xi to a platform in the center of the room, where a military band played the US and Chinese national anthems and the two leaders inspected an honor guard lined up against a massive mural of the Great Wall. A group of waiting schoolchildren bearing flags from both countries and flowers cheered for the leaders when given their cue.
After their morning meetings, the leaders were to take questions from reporters, a surprising last-minute addition to the schedule given China's tight media controls.
In the lead-up to the Obama-Xi meetings, US officials sought to refocus attention on areas of US agreement with the Chinese, including a climate pact that was the result of months of secret discussions between the two countries.
As part of the new agreement, Obama announced that the US would move much faster in cutting pollution, with a goal to reduce emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. Xi, whose country's emissions are still growing as it builds new coal plants, didn't commit to cut emissions by a specific amount. Rather, he set a target for China's emissions to peak by 2030, or earlier if possible.
The US and China also announced a reciprocal accord to extend visa lengths for their citizens. And Obama announced that the US and China had reached an understanding that would allow negotiations to move forward on a deal with the World Trade Organization to reduce tariffs on high-tech goods.
But despite the White House's public focus on cooperation, analysts say Xi's approach to running China is likely to lead to more tensions ahead.
``I think that consensus is growing that there's going to be more viscosity, more tension with China over the next few years,'' said Michael Green, an Asia analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. He added that Xi has proved to be ``less accommodating'' and ``tougher than expected'' in his dealings with the US
That's hardly the landscape Obama envisioned when he began trying to cultivate Xi as partner. Obama had developed little personal rapport with Xi's predecessor, the older and more formal Hu Jintao. But in Xi, US officials saw a potentially new kind of leader, with closer ties to the US than other Chinese officials _ he spent time in Iowa as an exchange student _ and an ease with public appearances that eluded Hu.
In an unusual move, Obama last summer invited Xi to a two-day retreat at Sunnylands, a sweeping estate in the southern California desert. Away from the glare of their capitals, the leaders held eight hours of wide-ranging talks, toasted each other with Chinese liquor and sealed their new relationship with a 50-minute stroll through the manicured grounds.
Both sides considered the summit a success. Yet the months that followed have seen increased tensions, from the US levying cyberspying charges against five Chinese officials to a recent series of close calls between US and Chinese aircraft in the Pacific.
Xi is still reciprocating Obama's California hospitality with a state visit in the Chinese capital. Following meetings Tuesday with regional leaders at an Asia-Pacific economic summit, Obama and Xi met for a private dinner at Zhong Nan Hai, the imperial gardens near Tiananmen Square that serve as the center of power for China's government and the Communist Party of China. In the spirit of the Sunnylands summit, the two men ditched their ties for dinner as they sought to project a more casual and comfortable atmosphere.

Sensex hits new record-high of 28 114; Nifty breaches 8 400-level on capital inflowsSensex jumps 99 points to 28,009 on sustained capital inflows

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by nearly 99 points at 28,008.90 on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors despite weak global cues.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty ended higher by 20.65 points at 8,383.30.
Among BSE sectoral indices, auto and banking indices were the star-performers and were up 1.18 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.37 per cent, followed by metal 0.9 per cent, PSU 0.57 per cent and capital goods 0.53 per cent.
Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and ITC were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel, NTPC and L&T.
The benchmark BSE Sensex surged 203.97 points or 0.73 per cent to trade at a new record-high of 28,114.03 in the morning session, breaking its previous peak of 28,027.96 reached on November 10.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade and hit a new life-time high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-share NSE index crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points or 0.53 per cent to trade at a life-time high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said that the domestic sentiment remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed the trading sentiment, they added.
A report by Equentis Capital said: "We expect markets likely to remain positive. Stay cautious and book profits on higher levels. The government will unveil IIP data for September 2014 and annual rate of inflation based on the combined consumer price indices (CPI) for urban and rural India for October 2014 on 12 November 2014. Inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for October 2014 will be released on 14 November 2014. Slower inflation could support regulators (RBI) to increase liquidity in the market in short-term and positive action by the regulators will be good for interest sensitive sectors/stocks."
European stocks
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS , Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Asian shares
Asian stocks extended their gains for the fourth day as Japanese shares climbed after the yen depreciated to a seven-year low amid speculation the nation will delay raising its sales tax again.
Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Nikkei 225 rose 73 points or 0.43 per cent at 17,197 and Hang Seng jumped 184.08 points or 0.77 per cent at 23,992.36.

Gautam Gambhir Bio
Fieriness and aggression are the two most important characteristics in an attacking opener. Gautam Gambhir has these two factors in abundance and this has served him well during his time in international cricket.
Having been a consistent run-scorer in domestic circuit at the start of the new millennium, Gambhir's first innings in international cricket was stop-start to say the least. He was unable to establish himself in the Test and ODI squad and drifted out of the team.
Following India's first-round exit in the 2007 World Cup, Gambhir was selected in the team for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. In the final against Pakistan, he hit a match-winning 75 to help India win the title in a closely fought match. The period from 2008-2010 was a watershed in Gambhir's career. He excelled in all formats and along with his Delhi mate, Virender Sehwag, formed a lethal opening partnership.
In 2008, Gambhir stroked 1134 runs in Tests at an average of 70.87 while in ODIs, he smashed 1119 runs at a whopping average of 90.53. The highlights in the year was a brilliant 206 against Australia in Delhi while in ODIs, he scored 440 runs at an average of 55 in the CB Series featuring Australia and Sri Lanka. From December 2008 to January 2009, Gambhir scored five centuries in five Tests, making him the fourth player to achieve this feat.
His exploits led him to be the ICC Player of the Year in 2009. His good form continued and in the 2011 World Cup, Gambhir played an important knock at a vital time. In the final against Sri Lanka, he scored 97 and helped India win the World Cup after 28 years. In 2012, Gambhir was pivotal to Kolkata Knight Riders winning the IPL for the first time.
Following the highs, Gambhir's form slid away drastically in the tours to England and Australia. Having endured a tough time in the series against England, Gambhir was dropped from the team and despite scoring two fifties and a century so far in the Ranji Trophy, Gambhir was not selected for the tour to South Africa.

DDA to frame policy to regularise properties of displaced peopleDDA to frame policy to regularise properties of displaced people
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 7, 2014  | 13:48 IST

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA)  has begun the process of formulating a policy for regularisation of thousands of properties occupied by displaced persons since 1940, a move that might benefit around one lakh families living on such lands.
In pursuance of the directions of DDA's Vice-Chairman Balvinder Kumar, the housing authority has started the process of formulating a policy on the basis of paying damages or leases, in 23 Nazul Estates of Delhi.
These 23 Nazul Estates of the DDA, fall in areas like Karol Bagh, Pahar Ganj, Anand Parbat, Chuna Mandi, among others, a top DDA official said. Government land falling under these Nazul Estates, after partition, was mainly occupied by refugees, who unauthorisedly settled in these open spaces.
These occupants were issued slips known as damages slips for using the government land. On constitution of DDA in 1957, these lands were transferred to the housing body.
The number of such properties in 1959 was approximately 18,179 only, the official said.
Over a period of time, these plots were either inherited, subdivided or sold and damages slips became the basis of various transactions or sale mutation etc, and in many cases the transactions were registered also.
The 'damages', as per the slips issued, were being collected through Damages Collectors. The number of these properties have now multiplied many times and there are around one lakh families, or about 5 lakh occupants, who are staying in these properties after paying damages and many even without paying any damages, the official said.
Some of the land in these areas was on leasehold basis and continues to be occupied by such occupants even though the leases have either expired or have been cancelled.
The official said that the DDA would now try to first ascertain the original settlers on such lands through survey of the National Population Register (NPR) 2011 and the Census House Listing Schedules of 2010-2011 along with local survey, and then work out modalities for the process accordingly.
Various socio-economic surveys are also being conducted to get the exact details. After the survey the decision to give a title to these residents will be taken, she said.

Pay Rs 20 more for ATM use at these banksNow, pay more for ATM use at SBI, HDFC, Axis Bank
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 16:08 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Banking consumers will have to pay more if they are prolific with ATM transactions as largest lender SBI and its private sector peers HDFC Bank and Axis Bank have capped the free-usage at three in six metros.
The capping and additional fees on excess usage come following the recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular allowing banks to limit the number of free ATM transactions to five - three in the largest six cities and two elsewhere - a month.
Under the new norms, which have been accepted by the RBI, a customer can do just three free ATM transactions in the six largest cities at own-bank machines and two elsewhere.
The new limits and rates by SBI, HDFC Bank and Axis will be applicable to transactions done in Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad.
The SBI, which had reported close to Rs 400 crore loss by way of paying other banks as inter-bank ATM usage in FY14, was the first one to cap ATM transactions at three and impose fees of Rs 20 per subsequent transaction. Since November 1, the new norms are effective at SBI.
However, the bank has allowed more free ATM transactions to those who avoid visiting its branches, and unlimited transactions for those with large balances.
The second and the third largest private sector players HDFC Bank and Axis Bank have also followed suit and said effective December 1, they too will charge Rs 20 per transaction above five a month.
While HDFC Bank will charge Rs 20 for cash withdrawals and Rs 8.5 (excluding taxes) for balance enquiry, mini statement, etc, Axis Bank will also charge Rs 20 and taxes for financial transactions and Rs 9.5 for non-financial ones.
At the third-party ATMs, HDFC and Axis will charge for more than three transactions, down from the earlier five free transactions, the banks said in separate customer notifications.
Axis Bank, which with a little over 12,000 ATMs is the no. 2 player after SBI, however, is offering 10 free transactions for its Prime Plus savings account and Prime salary account holders.
But both these account-holders need to have a minimum opening balance of Rs 1 lakh and they can have first five free transactions at non-home bank ATMs.
However, second largest lender ICICI Bank, with 11,739 ATMs, and fourth largest private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank told PTI that they are not revising the charges and limits of ATM usage from the existing levels.
Except SBI, however, none of the state-run lenders has announced charging ATM transaction beyond five, as is the practice now.
Banks, in association with the National Payments Corporation that issues the RuPay Cards , had earlier sent a proposal to the RBI to reduce the number of free ATM transactions at non-home bank ATMs due to the higher cost incurred by them. They also wanted the RBI to go ahead with capping free ATM use by their own consumers to control cost.
Following this, the RBI issued guidelines in August allowing banks to charge their customers Rs 20 per transaction after the first five free transactions from November 1.
From November 1, SBI has been charging for more than own-ATM withdrawals a month with those accounts having less than Rs 25,000 in monthly balance. But those accounts with over Rs 25,000 and above in balance there is no limit at its own ATM network. But, their access to third-party ATMs are capped at three a month.
Those who exceed the limit will pay Rs 5 per transaction at its ATMs and Rs 20 at machines belonging to other banks.
The bank is charging Rs 8 for each non-financial transaction above the cap.
The bank has also raised the number of free usage on its home network from five to nine, if a customer does not visit a branch during the month.
For those who maintain average balances of over Rs 1 lakh, SBI is providing unlimited access to all ATMs. However, those with less than Rs 25,000 balances are charged above five transactions on its ATMs and three at third-party machines.
As per latest data from the RBI, at the end of June quarter there were 1,66,894 ATMs in the country and with 44,929 machines, SBI is way ahead of its nearest rival Axis Bank by more than three times or over 27 per cent of the market.
SBI has 12.59 crore cardholders and accounts for 31 per cent of the 40.9 crore debit cards in the country and its cardholders are responsible for over 41 per cent of all ATM transactions.

The best fund house of them allThe best fund house of them all
K Venkatasubramanian
Tweet
Five big fund houses have seen all their diversified equity schemes beat the market across time-frames. K Venkatasubramanian identifies the toppers
Investors who put their faith in diversified equity mutual funds from the leading houses have been well rewarded over the past five years. If your portfolio featured only diversified equity schemes from the top 10 fund houses by assets under management, your returns would have easily beaten all of the key indices – the Nifty, CNX 500 and CNX Midcap index. These top 10 fund houses account for about 80 per cent of the total assets under management in the mutual fund industry.
This is in contrast to the situation three years ago. In 2011, only three of the top 15 fund houses stayed ahead of standard benchmarks across one-, three- and five-year time-frames. But which fund houses fared the best of them all? A BusinessLine analysis shows that across all their schemes, Franklin Templeton, ICICI Prudential and SBI Mutual figured on top, their equity funds delivering the highest returns over the past five years.
For the purposes of this analysis, we averaged the returns of all the diversified equity funds of each house over one-, three- and five-year periods and compared the averages to all three commonly used benchmark indices — the Nifty, CNX 500 and CNX Midcap.
The results show that equity funds which take active calls on stocks, instead of piggybacking on an index, did well by investors. Over the last five years, fund houses managing active schemes delivered 15-18 per cent annual returns, way ahead of the 11-12 per cent that the representative indices notched up over this period. Over one- and three-year periods too, fund houses performed better than the indices.
This doesn’t, however, mean that all the schemes of these asset management companies figured in the party. There were underperformers , but their numbers are still small. The chances of getting stuck with a dud are thus low, especially if holdings are over longer time-frames.
The last five years also saw the markets going through longer bull or bear periods, unlike in 2009, when a sudden spurt between March and May had caught many fund houses with cash positions off-guard. Over 2010-14, there has been enough time for asset management companies to take decisive calls or alter strategies.
Top houses deliver
Each of the top 10 asset management companies has 5-10 diversified equity schemes, which exclude sector, thematic or tax-saving funds.
The average returns of these schemes over one-, three- and five-year periods is taken to be the respective fund house’s returns for a particular time-frame. These average returns are compared to the indices.
According to this filter, all the top 10 fund houses have come out on top as they beat the Nifty, CNX-500 and CNX Midcap across all durations. These three benchmarks were considered because fund houses have schemes that feature large-, multi- and mid-cap stocks.
In all, these asset management companies offer 76 diversified equity schemes. Over all time-frames, 70-71 of these — or a healthy 92-93 per cent of the schemes — outperformed the benchmarks. Returns over periods more than a year are annualised.
Franklin Templeton came out on top as the best performing fund house. Schemes belonging to this AMC delivered the highest returns among the pack across various tenures.
Delivering 60.7 per cent, 24.7 per cent and 17.9 per cent returns over one-, three- and five-year time-frames, the fund house has been the best of the lot. The level of out-performance over longer time-frames is 5-8 percentage points for Franklin Templeton.
ICICI Prudential too follows closely, with similar levels of out-performance over the years.
Many others, such as SBI and Birla Sun Life, have also done well, beating the benchmarks significantly.
The largest of the lot, HDFC, too performed reasonably well, though it falls considerably behind in the pecking order.
IDFC, with 41.3 per cent, 18.3 per cent and 14.8 per cent returns over one-, three- and five-year periods, respectively, figures at the bottom of the pile, though as a fund house, it still beat all the benchmarks.
Very few underperformers
Even as this fund house-based analysis presents a pretty picture at the aggregate level, it is important to go deeper and check individual schemes to see if the overall picture is propped up by just a few sterling performers.
It is here that five fund houses stand out. In Franklin Templeton, ICICI Prudential, Birla Sun Life, UTI and Kotak Mahindra, all the schemes have outperformed indices over one-, three- and five-year time-frames. The benchmarks, as mentioned earlier, were based on the market cap bias of schemes.
Reliance, SBI, DSP BlackRock and HDFC have seen individual schemes failing at one time or the other, though the fund houses have had an otherwise good track record.
IDFC alone has a relatively ordinary performance record, with only two-three schemes from its basket of five funds outperforming across time periods.
For Franklin, its Prima Plus, Flexi Cap, Smaller Companies and High Growth Companies funds performed extremely well. These schemes, spread across market caps, have done consistently well across market cycles.
Though large-cap fund Franklin India Bluechip has fallen behind its category, it has still beaten the Sensex and the Nifty. For ICICI Prudential, though, almost all schemes have been top-quartile performers over the past five years. These include Focused Bluechip, Dynamic, Top 100, Value Discovery and Target Returns.
In the case of HDFC, its largest schemes, Equity and Top 200, have picked up in recent times. But many others had an indifferent 2012 and 2013. Its Premier multi-cap, large-cap and growth funds have not been spectacular outperformers, thus dragging the fund house’s returns.
For IDFC, its Imperial Equity and Classic Equity funds have underperformed. The largest fund of the group, IDFC Premier Equity, outstripped the CNX 500 and CNX Midcap indices over the years, though it has fallen significantly behind its better-performing peers.
UTI’s schemes, while not chartbusters, have done fairly well after 2007 and especially over the past three-four years. Schemes such as UTI Equity, Opportunities and Midcap have been top quartile performers for a while now.
All of its seven schemes have beaten respective benchmarks consistently over the past five years. Birla Sun Life too has seen all its schemes outperform. While Birla Sun Life’s Equity and Birla Sun Life's Frontline Equity funds did reasonably well, though not topping charts, others such as its Top 100, Long Term Advantage and Pure Value schemes recorded top-quartile returns in their respective categories.
In the case of Kotak Mahindra, its Emerging Equity and Select Focus funds delivered top notch returns, other schemes such as Opportunities, Midcap and Classic Equity delivered above-average performances, beating benchmarks easily.
Most top-performing fund houses have timed the sector shift right — from defensives such as software, consumer non-durables and pharma, that they held in 2011, to cyclicals such as auto, energy and capital goods in late 2013.
Given the relatively gradual nature of the rallies and falls, many fund houses were able to course-correct and catch up. HDFC is a good example, as most of its schemes moved from the bottom to the top of the charts over the past year.
In the top 10 fund houses, there is also a strong set of multi- and mid-cap schemes. As much as two-thirds of the schemes in these AMCs invest in a blend of stocks. Thus, most of them have benefited from the broader market rallies over the past few years.
In the last five years, large-cap schemes from these asset management companies have delivered 15-17 per cent annually, multi-caps gave 16.5-19.5 per cent returns, while mid-caps managed to return 22-25 per cent over this period.
On the mend
Funds houses, such as SBI and Reliance, have been on a strong revival path, especially over the past three to four years. Many of their schemes had fallen heavily in 2008-09 and had failed to catch up in subsequent rallies. But that has changed.
Reliance’s Vision and Growth schemes, which had underperformed heavily till 2010, have been on the mend. In fact, both schemes have gone on to become steady performers over the past couple of years. Reliance Equity Opportunities and Reliance Small Cap fall in the top quartile in returns. The fund house’s ability to pick performing mid-caps appears to be sound in recent years as was the case till 2008.
SBI too has seen a smart revival in fortunes. Many of its schemes have delivered top-quartile returns over the long term. SBI Magnum’s Multiplier Plus, Equity, Global, Bluechip, and Emerging Businesses have all turned around strongly from early 2010 and have proven themselves over the past four years.
Choosing funds
The top 10 fund houses have been chosen for this analysis as they manage the chunk of investor funds and, hence, investor interest is highest in their schemes. But there are other fund houses and schemes that have done well over the long term, which investors may choose.
While there is no case for blindly choosing schemes from the top AMCs, their record, especially over the long term, indicates that most such schemes reward investors with benchmark-beating returns.
They have weathered multiple market cycles and have grown their assets, helped by stable fund manager tenures and smooth transitions; they are, hence, more sought after by investors.
Many foreign fund houses such as Morgan Stanley, ING and Fidelity have sold their AMC business to home-grown players. While a fund house selling out itself may not always be a cause for alarm for investors, the uncertainty associated with the new fund managers and their previous track record can be a cause for concern. Therefore, some amount of caution is necessary in choosing the fund house, apart from the due diligence that needs to go into choosing the right schemes.
Outside the large houses
Outside the top 10, there are several fund houses that have a set of quality schemes such as Axis, Tata, Canara Robeco, L&T, Mirae Asset, BNP Paribas and Quantum Mutual all of which have several schemes that figure in the top quartile of performance in their respective categories. So, select schemes from these houses too may be chosen.
For example Tata Dividend Yield, Axis Equity, Canara Robeco Emerging Equities, L&T Equity, L&T Value, Mirae Asset India Opportunities, Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip, BNP Paribas Equity, BNP Paribas Dividend Yield and Quantum Long Term Equity are all quality funds.

Soyameal exports crash 85% inOctGold futures price falls on global cues
India’s soyameal exports plunged 85% in October, as poor raw material supplies cut output and affected competitiveness in the overseas market. Outbound shipments slid to just 29,690 tonne in October, compared with 1,94,486 tonne a year before, according to data released by Soyabean Processors Association on Friday.
Although exports recovered slightly from this fiscal’s trough in September,  they touched just 1.27 lakh tonne during April-October, as against 10.71 lakh tonne a year before. These data do not include supplies to Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh by rail or road. fe Bureau

The question of the sealed envelopeUpdated: November 11, 2014 01:20 IST
The question of the sealed envelope
Peter Ronald deSouza
judiciary (system of justice)
In the black money case, all our hopes are glued to a ‘sealed envelope’ submitted by the government to the Supreme Court. But will we ever question the political culture associated with it?
It would certainly be an exaggeration to suggest that the advance of the Rule of Law in India hinges on the jurisprudence around the “sealed envelope.” And yet when one heard the discussion on television the other day, between the Attorney General of India, Mukul Rohtagi, and the TV anchor, Karan Thapar, on whether the decision by the government of India to give the names of those with black money accounts in Swiss banks to the Supreme Court violated the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with France, one would be forgiven if one believed that this was indeed the case. Should the government of India have handed over to the Supreme Court of India the sealed envelope with the 627 names? Was this action a violation of the DTAA with France or was it consistent with the terms of the agreement? Are the arguments being advanced by legal officers pragmatic ones, i.e., there will be damaging international repercussions; or ones of principle, i.e., it was given to our Supreme Court and hence was concerned with our sovereignty? Can India be trusted as a country where the rule of law prevails? In the sealed envelope lie many issues of our constitutional democracy. Open it we must.
Lines of inquiry
Listening carefully to the TV discussion, one discerned two possible lines of inquiry. The first is obviously legal where questions relating to the Supreme Court’s instruction and the government’s reluctant compliance with it, in the light of India’s treaty obligations, need to be examined in terms of the rule of law. The other, interestingly, is cultural where the many meanings of “the sealed envelope,” in our public discourse, needs detailing. Let me begin with the legal dimension.
For a public discussion, there are four substantive aspects of the legal case that need to be flagged. The first concerns “the jurisdiction” of the Supreme Court of India. While there are many fine issues of the law that will be debated by scholars and practitioners of international law, concerning treaty obligations and international bodies which have the authority to adjudicate over them, we must not lose sight of the single issue at stake here of the extent of the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction within our constitutional order. Even if there is a conflict between the court’s direction, to hand over to it the list of names in the government’s custody, and the treaty obligations which prevent the government from handing over names to anyone including a court except in a specific case where there is a prosecution under way against named persons, I would argue that the principle of sovereignty makes it binding on the government of India to hand over, if instructed, the entire list to the court. This single act establishes the sovereignty of our constitutional order. Our court will decide how the government shall act in a situation of multiple obligations including international ones.
Since the “rule of law” is a feature of the basic structure of the Constitution, and since the Supreme Court is the custodian, in the last instance, of this “basic structure,” as per the judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case, it is safe to assume that the court will act consistently with the rule of law. Its decision is final as far as the rule of law is concerned. For some state or non-state external authority to seek to prohibit the government of India from sharing its data with the Supreme Court is both arrogant and wrong; arrogant because it downgrades the Indian Supreme Court to a subordinate status on matters of law, and wrong because it gives higher authority to an external authority.
Courts in the United States have repeatedly affirmed their own supremacy on jurisdictional issues, most recently in the hefty fine they levied, of about $9 billion, on the French Bank BNP Paribas.
Rewarding the predator
This brings me to the second aspect, the nature of the existing international economic order which rewards predators, and justifies this structure of reward under the specious argument of the rule of law. There are many instances where Global Capital, particularly American, uses its domestic laws to punish, by law, those who stand up to its interests since, over the last few years, it has built up a web of interlocking laws, both domestic and international, that have ring-fenced these interests. The consequence of this, particularly for the global South, is that predators can seek protection by hiding behind laws in extraterritorial jurisdictions. These partisan laws protect the predator against the just claims of the victim. Look at the Bhopal gas tragedy case and compare it against BP in the Gulf of Mexico. The Indian Supreme Court standing up to these partisan laws that protect predators is in fact a blow for the rule of law. International tax havens and banks with secret accounts have in recent years succumbed to pressure from the U.S. government to reveal names of U.S. nationals who are tax avoiders. Here the defence of secrecy and privacy do not stand up to the U.S. demand. This courtesy, of revealing names is, however, not available to Countries of the Global South who do not have the means to impose their will. A powerful army is clearly a stronger argument to achieve desired outcomes than a powerful argument.
The third issue is whether the “sealed envelope” being handed over to the court meets the requirements of the rule of law, to protect the right to privacy of any individual, even one who is accused. The Attorney General seems to think there is no inconsistency in the list being handed over, in a sealed envelope, from the government of India’s custody, the party to the DTAA agreement, to the Supreme Court, which is a different institutional authority. As long as the envelope remains “sealed.” But what if the court opened the envelope? Would it amount to a breach of the DTAA? The Attorney General seemed to imply that this would be so and argued that the court should not open the envelope even though it has possession of it. So while the court has the names in a sealed envelope, and can choose to know who they are by opening the envelope, it chose to hand over the unopened envelope to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by it to investigate the black money case. Did the learned judges, by this action, align the Indian law with DTAA, thereby meeting both requirements of the supremacy of India’s Supreme Court and the protections to persons under DTAA?
This brings us to the fourth issue, the moral and legal issue of the status of the data. Since it was stolen data, and also data made available by a whistle-blower, can a constitutional system use this data for prosecution? Is the use of stolen data compatible with the rule of law? Does the fact that the data was confirmed by the government of France change its legal status as stolen data? Is this similar to the “doctrine of double effect” in moral philosophy, where an action that causes harm is permitted, as a side effect, if the primary purpose of the action is to promote some good end? Germany had to deal with this moral conundrum when stolen data from a Swiss bank, of German tax avoiders, was offered to the German government for a price. The German government bought the stolen data.
Guarantee of impartiality
Now let me move to the other dimension, the political culture of the “sealed envelope.” The question of whether this is an Indian ritual or a colonial legacy is for historians to establish. For those of us who have worked on government committees, the “sealed envelope” guarantees the impartiality of the process. I have been a member of the executive committee of many universities and in many meetings, almost routinely, a “sealed envelope” is placed before the committee and we are informed that it contains the list of candidates, selected by a committee, for a professor’s position in a particular department. The sealed envelope has been in the possession of the registrar who, at the meeting, formally seeks the permission of the vice-chancellor to open it. This is given by a subtle nod. The envelope is then held up, higher than the table around which we are seated, as if to place it in the light and thereby show the members of the committee that the process is both proper and confidential. In some cases the envelope is sealed with red wax. A little ceremony of de-sealing the envelope then takes place, an important ritual of impartiality. None among the committee’s members even looks at the envelope. When was it sealed? Who sealed it? Could it have been done 20 minutes before the meeting, are questions too embarrassing to be asked. The opened envelope is not subjected to forensic examination. We have seen the raised sealed envelope. This is enough. Fairness is guaranteed. It meets the CAG’s requirement. I asked an eminent sociologist to give me his learned opinion on the semiotic significance of the sealed envelope for our democratic polity. He promised to give me his views in a sealed envelope.

Watch: 207mph on a bicycleYour e-rickshaw has arrived
Last weekend, the Frenchman (a bus driver by trade) rode his rocket-powered bicycle to a jaw-dropping, white-knuckle-inducing, sphincter-puckering speed of 207mph. Yes, you read that right: Two hundred and seven miles an hour. On a bicycle.
But that's not the impressive bit. Thanks to a Hulk-like grip, he managed to go over the double tonne in just 4.8 seconds, which is over 10 seconds quicker than the Hennessey Venom GT - the car that currently holds the record for the production car 0-200mph sprint - can manage.
Admittedly, Gissy's velo of choice is a bit different to your standard Boris Bike. Without wanting to sound like a MENSA science club, Gissy's bike utilizes a TOWIE season's worth of hydrogen peroxide, which is passed over metals. When this combines with oxygen in the atmosphere, it creates an almighty amount of go that leaves a Ferrari Scuderia wondering which way it went at Paul Ricard's long straight in the South of France.
When the fuse is lit, 4.5 kN of thrust - the equivalent of 560 horsepower - and 19Gs worth of acceleration shoots Gissy at the horizon quicker than you can say many naughty words. Never has the advice ‘hold on tight' been more prevalent.
Check out the run - and Gissy's amazing hair - in the video above. Then let us know if you think the pedal pushers have finally chalked one up against us petrolheads.

Maybe It Wasn t The Higgs Boson After Allreddit
Was all the Higgs hoopla a bit premature?
In a new paper that has raised eyebrows around the world, an international team of scientists says there is no proof that the particle whose discovery was confirmed last year by physicists at CERN is the long-sought Higgs boson .
"The CERN data is generally taken as evidence that the particle is the Higgs particle ," Dr. Mads Tourdal Frandsen, an associate professor in the University of Southern Denmark's Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics Phenomenology and a member of the team, said in a written statement. "It is true that the Higgs particle can explain the data but there can be other explanations."
The new research seems to piggyback on previous research suggesting that the Higgs boson is actually made up of smaller particles, UPI reported.
CERN's data simply isn't precise enough to prove the particle discovered was the Higgs boson, Frandsen said. And he's not the only physicist to acknowledge the ambiguity in the data.
"The data from the LHC experiments are certainly consistent with the Higgs expectations of how it is produced and how it decays, as well as the spin of this particle," Dr. Michael Tuts, a particle physicist at Columbia University in New York City and a leading researcher at CERN, told The Huffington Post in an email. "However, as the article points out, that may not be the only explanation of this new particle."
If it wasn't the Higgs boson CERN scientists found, what was it?
"We believe that it may be a so-called techni-higgs particle," Frandsen said in the statement.
The Higgs and techni-higgs have similar properties but belong to different theories of the universe, according to the statement. And while the Higgs is believed to be an elementary particle, the techni-higgs isn't. It's composed of two so-called techni-quarks, which are believed to be elementary particles.
Like Frandsen, Tuts believes new research will be required to answer the Higgs question once and for all.
"We will need more data collected over the coming years in order to be able to rule out other explanations," Tuts said in his email. "The discovery of this particle, which we presume is the Higgs, has opened up a whole new area of study."
The paper describing the new research was published Aug. 13, 2014 in the journal Physical Review D.

AP Demands FBI Never Again Impersonate JournalistAssociated Press Demands FBI Never Again Impersonate Media
 | By                                                                By ERIC TUCKER

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Associated Press on Monday demanded assurances from the Justice Department that the FBI will never again impersonate a member of the news media, following revelations that an agent in Seattle portrayed himself as an AP journalist during a criminal investigation.
In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director James Comey, the president and CEO of the news cooperative, Gary Pruitt, also demanded to know who authorized the 2007 impersonation, what process was followed for its approval, how the requirements to impersonate the media are different from seven years ago and whether such operations are still being carried out.
"Most importantly, we want assurances that this won't happen again," Pruitt wrote.
Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon confirmed Monday that the letter had been received, but declined to comment further.
Comey revealed in a letter to The New York Times last week that an FBI agent had posed as an AP reporter to help catch a 15-year-old suspected of making bomb threats at a high school in Washington state. Comey said the agent posing as an AP reporter asked the suspect to review a fake AP article about threats and cyberattacks directed at the school to ensure "that the anonymous suspect was portrayed fairly."
The bogus article contained a software tool that could verify Internet addresses. The suspect clicked on a link, revealing his computer's location and Internet address, which helped agents confirm his identity.
The FBI director defended the "unusual technique" as legal under agency guidelines at the time, and still lawful "and, in a rare case, appropriate" today, although he said it would now "probably require higher-level approvals than in 2007."
Pruitt said that assertion was of "no comfort" to the news media. AP's "legacy of objectivity, truth, accuracy and integrity" has been degraded, he wrote.
"In stealing our identity, the FBI tarnishes that reputation, belittles the value of the free press rights enshrined in our Constitution and endangers AP journalists and other newsgatherers around the world," he wrote. "This deception corrodes the most fundamental tenet of a free press — our independence from government control and corollary responsibility to hold government accountable."
Pruitt called the 2007 case "yet another example of the Department of Justice overreaching," citing also the secret seizing last year of phone records of AP reporters and editors during a national security leak investigation.
"That operation, like the impersonation disclosed last week by Director Comey, erodes our ability to gather news by intimidating sources who might otherwise speak freely with our journalists," Pruitt wrote.

Manohar Parrikar set to boost Defence MinistryNew Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar set to boost defence with transparent, speedy decisions
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 12:37 IST
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar files Rajya Sabha nomination papers at Vidhan Sabha Bhawan in Lucknow on Monday as BJP leaders look on.
Newly appointed Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar acknowledged on Monday that he was an upstart in matters related to the armed forces even as he promised to bring his speciality of transparency and fast-paced decision-making to the South Block.
"That is my speciality," said Parrikar, referring to his ability of making speedy and clean decisions.
From ruling the tiny coastal state of Goa, which is better known as a tourism hub, to managing the security of the country, Parrikar comes to the national capital with a reputation of being part of the breed of honest and decisive technocrat politicians.
He refrained from talking about issues concerning the Ministry of Defence (MoD) on his first day in office, but Parrikar dropped enough hints that he meant business.
He advocated merits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' policy and the need to develop quickly.
There is a task cut out for Parrikar as Modi appointed a full-fledged defence minister five months after assuming power. During his short stint as a temporary holder of the portfolio, Arun Jaitley gave a push to several stalled acquisition projects.
Parrikar said his predecessor Jaitley had taken decisions despite constraints and he would carry forward the task.
It will take some time for the former chief minister to settle down as he admitted that he got only five minutes to pack his bags and move to Delhi.
After his swearing-in ceremony, he had flown to Lucknow to file his nomination for entry into the Rajya Sabha as he is not a member of either house of Parliament. In Lucknow, he said the defence minister was defenceless before the press, but he would not let the country go defenceless.
The only defence matter he talked about on day one was the sinking of a torpedo recovery vessel off Vishakhapatnam. Parrikar said he would get a brief on the accident as he mentioned another naval mishap involving a fire on board a submarine last year.
Parrikar assumes charge at a time when the armed forces are in the middle of a modernisation process and are looking up to the political leadership for speedy transformation.
The border with China is calm at the moment and guns have fallen silent on the Line of Control (LoC) and the international boundary with Pakistan. But the two boundaries have the tendency to flare up at any time.
His immediate task will be to streamline the procurement process and deliver decisions on several pending big ticket purchases. His predecessor Jaitley had vowed to ensure that the Defence Acquisition Council meets every month.
Parrikar is also bracing up for the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament.
In the coming days, he will get extensive briefings on the functioning of the ministry. He began by meeting the three service chiefs who called on him together. Defence Secretary RK Mathur also called on the minister.
The NDA government has opened up the defence sector to foreign investors, but experts say the policy needs to be made more attractive to get maximum benefits.
PARRIKAR TO GO TO RS FROM UP
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, who was in Lucknow on Monday, said that his focus would be on strategically strengthening India.
"India's relationship with its neighbours is an extremely sensitive issue and I would to able to talk about it only after a discussion with PM Narendra Modi," the former chief minister of Goa told mediapersons.
Parrikar was in Lucknow on Monday to file his nomination papers for Rajya Sabha elections. "I am feeling proud that I am going to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, the land which produces most popular politicians. I am also lucky that my party has given me the opportunity to get connected with this state. I promise to use my skills and abilities for the growth of the state," he said.
Meanwhile, party sources told Mail Today that all BJP MLAs were asked to be present at the party office on the occasion. "By sending Parrikar to Rajya Sabha from UP, Modi and Amit Shah are trying to send a message to the state BJP unit that leaders from outside (Centre) can be superimposed on them," a senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.

Uddhav demands LoP and Speaker s posts in MaharashtraPrint
The cornered Shiv Sena decided to go all-out against its former ally the BJP by staking a claim for the Leader of the Opposition's post, and gunning for the Speaker's chair in the Maharashtra Assembly.
The tactic became apparent on Monday after the Sena MLAs sat in the opposition benches at the start of a three-day special session in the Assembly.
Outside the House, Shiv Sena leader Diwakar Raote attacked the BJP government’s proposal to introduce Urdu in the Marathi medium schools.
Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray wrote a letter to the Assembly secretariat, seeking the Leader of Opposition (LoP) post. Uddhav nominated Eknath Shinde for the post.
While the Sena will get the Leader of Opposition post given its strength in the Assembly, it will need the support of other parties to win the Speaker’s post.
“We are going to get Leader of Opposition's post as we are the second largest party with 63 MLAs. If we also get our candidate in the Speaker's chair, the BJP will rue their decision to dump us,” a Sena leader said.
The Sena leaders have already approached NCP supremo Sharad Pawar seeking his support to get a Sena candidate elected to the Speaker's post.
On Monday, Pawar cryptically said he would take a call depending on the candidates in the fray.
Reacting to the Sena’s plan, the BJP accused Uddhav’s party of constantly shifting its stand.
“This is not double standard…it is multiple standard of the Sena. They have claimed the Leader of Opposition's post.
"Now, they are also eying the Speaker's post and simultaneously proceeding talks with us on power sharing,” BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said.
Sources said Sena has demanded 10-12 ministries, including the crucial home and urban development department portfolio, from the BJP.
“The Sena had also asked the BJP leadership to induct its leaders into the ministry before the trust vote on November 12,” the sources said.
In fact, the decision to stake claim for Leader of Opposition post was taken by the Sena leadership after it did not receive any communication from the BJP regarding its demands.
Earlier in the day, Raote brought out a skull cap and announced that it was for Minority Affairs Minister Eknath Khadse.
“Why is there a need to introduce Urdu in Marathi medium schools in the state, when they already have recognized schools teaching the language?” the Sena leader asked.

Big play in online video spaceEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
It was around mid-September when online search engine giant Google announced that it would make YouTube videos available to Android users in India, offline. This meant that people would be able to download videos in their YouTube app when connected to a Wi-Fi network and then, view them later as many times as they wanted, without any data connection. Interestingly, the viewership that the videos and the ads on them garnered would be tracked offline too wherein the content would be made accessible to the consumer offline only after the content owners give their consent to it.
Now, when Google was busy making this announcement, FameBox Network, an Indian digital video network, decided that it would invest $10 million in digital channels to become Asia’s premier talent led digital entertainment network by 2017. This network would straddle over 5,000 video channels enlisting over 50,000 content creators across six Asian markets in the next three years.
It’s not just the content owners and creators that are walking the digital path. Advertisers too are finding the online video space convincing enough to head for a ‘digital first’ strategy when designing their brand communication. Last month, Epic Television Networks, the integrated media company promoted by industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Anand Mahindra and entrepreneur Rohit Khattar, rolled out a video promo on YouTube to reveal the first look of its Hindi general entertainment channel, Epic. Again, auto maker Hyundai Motor India (HMI) launched an online video campaign titled ‘Aliens Capture’ to promote its SUV variant Santa Fe with the intent to expand its brand outreach through digital. Not to forget, in September, Nescafe launched the #ItAllStarts campaign on YouTube featuring a stammering comedian that just ‘stuttered’ its way into the digital space with over 5 million YouTube views.
As Sanjay Gupta, senior general manager and group head – marketing, Hyundai Motor India, puts it, video marketing has become one of the most important advertising tools in today’s business. “Video marketing has the potential to go viral or generate views from a lot of potential customers. It is repeatedly shared on social media sites or by email with thousands of viewers generating a large amount to traffic to the video.”
He says that by accessing the ad on the digital platform, the audience is able to respond emotionally to the content of the video ad. “We immediately get to know the response about our product,” he adds.
Internet audience
The reasons are not too far to seek. Indians today watch close to 5 billion videos every month—almost five times the size of the country’s population. “The average time spent in watching online videos per user has grown by as much as 27% between 2013 and 2014 wherein an average viewer watches close to 68.7 videos for a total of 431.5 minutes per month. That’s the time spent by a housewife who religiously watches a daily soap every day of the week for one full month,” says Harikrishnan Pillai, founder, TheSmallBigIdea, a digital marketing agency.
The fact that anybody can put up a video on the net unlike television or radio that needs a deep-pocketed broadcaster to develop and distribute the content is a big game-changer. “The online video industry is steadily escaping the rigid hands of the organised media such as television channels and music companies. Anyone with talent and dedication can put their expression out there,” says Bobby Pawar, chief creative officer, Publicis South Asia. “The creators are now able to self-distribute their content thanks to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. And an audience that gets bored faster than ever before is discovering these new shots of entertainment and spreading them.”
Now, while the reasons are plenty, the most important factors that are driving the growth of online video consumption seem to be the growing penetration of mobile and internet clubbed with the falling internet bandwidth prices.
Internet penetration in India is only 16%, which works out to around 220 million people. Out of this, about 110 million people are consuming content on the mobile phone. Now out of the 110 million, 85% are consuming content on feature phones that have 2G connections wherein video streaming is very difficult. “This is a very big opportunity,” says Suveer Bajaj, co-founder and director–media operations, FoxyMoron, a full service digital agency. “MTNL and its national counterparts have collectively reported that the asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) connection usage in India is going to spike from 100 million to 300 million in the next 18 months. Not to forget, the government is looking at investing around R500 crore towards rural internet penetration,” he adds.
Now with internet penetration going strong, 4G eventually going mass and smartphones getting cheaper, video content consumption on mobile is only going to get even more aggressive. “4G is a very big opportunity for content consumers. Once it goes mass, 3G rates should get slashed by 40-50%. So, while right now about 4.5 million people choose to use 3G connections, this number should double with the adoption of 4G in the near future,” says Roopak Saluja, founder and CEO of The 120 Media Collective, a company that creates communications solutions and content for audiences and brands across multiple platforms and geographies. Bang Bang Films, a production company, and Jack in the Box Worldwide, a digital agency, are part of The 120 Media Collective.
The YouTube connect
When one talks of online videos, YouTube is but a natural corollary. According to industry experts, the monthly reach of YouTube in India is 50-60 million with about 3.5 million unique users visiting YouTube on a per day basis.
“Indian YouTube users are spending significant time watching, creating, curating and uploading videos on YouTube,” says Gautam Anand, director of content and operations, YouTube Asia-Pacific. “Three-quarter of Indian internet users consider YouTube the first stop when looking for videos in general. Altogether, 63% of internet-savvy Indians using YouTube watch music videos. About half of them watch TV shows and film trailers. Two in five also rely on YouTube to educate themselves. Meanwhile, around one-third go to YouTube to watch user-generated videos,” he says.
The fact that YouTube is localised in 61 countries and languages makes it a clear favourite among its user base. As per YouTube, 100 hours of videos are uploaded to the website every minute, thereby making it the largest video repository in the online space.
“Analogous to retail, think of YouTube as a mall, which naturally has high footfalls so the chances of walk-ins are far greater,” says Saluja.
Having said that, apart from YouTube there are other services too in India that are getting attention. Take, for instance, Aircel Popkorn (Live TV) that allows customers to watch live TV and videos-on-demand (VOD) or record shows for a later view. “Since youth, a section which is highly sports-driven, is a very important segment for us, Aircel associated with a digital company called DigiVive to offer Pepsi IPL streaming on Aircel nexGTv this year. Currently, we are also exploring services related to video blogging, sporting events and devotional feeds. We feel that these categories have significant potential that can be tapped,” says Anupam Vasudev, chief marketing officer, Aircel.
Money matters
With the onset of video advertising, audiences are now able to spend more time on one platform without being stuck in one place. This is music to the advertisers’ ears. A joint report by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) states that the size of the online advertising industry should jump from the current R3,000 crore to R10,000 crore in the next five years—an indication that more and more advertisers should start investing into the online space to captivate their target audience. Now, industry pundits note that it is video advertising, currently about 22% of the digital advertising pie, which will be propelling this growth.
“Digital advertising in India is expected to display a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32% to reach R7400 crore in 2017, with 2014 closing estimates being close to R4000 crore. Video advertising currently forms 22% of this pie. Ad spending on online video is increasing close to 46% year-on-year in the last two years, far outpacing search (15%) and display overall (19%),” says Pillai.
The primary monetisation techniques used by the platforms include the AVOD (Advertising-VOD) model, the SVOD (Subscription-VOD) model and the TVOD (Transactional VOD) model. The AVOD model is the original YouTube model where YouTube manages and plays the advertisement and the revenue generated is shared with the content owner on a pre-decided percentage basis. In the SVOD model, people subscribe to a monthly pack to get access to the content. Here, the content owners either take a share of the revenue or are paid upfront a ‘minimum guarantee’ amount to have their content on board. The TVOD model is a pay-per-use model where the viewer pays a particular amount only when he wants to watch a particular content. Here, the revenue sharing with the content owner is a greater percentage wherein sometimes for some prestigious content properties, these platforms also pay the content owners an upfront fee. Now, with YouTube almost synonymous to the online video industry, YouTube is said to keep around 45% of the spoils before sharing with content creators and publishers.
Today, the largest demographic on the internet is the 15-35 age group. And that is the target audience that brands are seeking. No wonder then that brands are seeking amplification of content through digital media. The math also supports this strategy. The production cost of a 10-second ad for television is R20-40 lakh. If the same commercial is to be made only for the online platform, which could be lengthier also, it will not cost more than R4-5 lakh. Now, if a brand intends to buy a 10-second spot on a top Hindi general entertainment channel, it would have to shell out a minimum of R70,000. On digital, that inventory could be bought at a fraction of that price wherein the ad could run for a longer duration. For instance, the Nescafe ad on YouTube runs for 3 minutes but on TV its duration is cut short to a few seconds. “If an advertiser knows the exact location or demographics (age, gender, etc.,) of his target audience, then he can show only his select target audience the video, rather than wasting money showing a non-target audience. Therefore, return of investments from video can be assessed by platform, geography, time period, etc., at a very granular level unlike TV which only has macro level measurement,” says Suhale Kapoor, executive vice president and co-founder, Absolutdata Research & Analytics. Absolutdata is a consulting-oriented, analytics & research firm with Fortune 500 clients across more than 40 countries.
Even otherwise, it is a win-win situation. When a video commercial is launched on the digital platform, it creates humungous conversations. That content, if taken onto television, only helps in increasing the momentum.
“Evidently, digital video is increasingly being served and consumed across platforms that range from social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to chat platforms such as WeChat. With the mobile being the primary media device, video content is increasingly going to be platform
agnostic. In effect, video will be the new text, the new language of consumer internet,” says Saket Saurabh, CEO of digital entertainment network #fame Digital.

We can serve ads on the mobile in real time that corresponds to the TV commercial: Brian Lesser  XaxisEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
All advertising in the future will go digital, and all digital buying will be programmatic, saysXaxis global chief executive officer Brian Lesser prophetically. Lesser should know. Xaxis, one of the youngest companies in the GroupM fold, has been leading GroupM’s foray into programmatic buying since the last three years, servicing over 2700 clients in 32 markets across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.Prior to founding Xaxis, Lesser was senior vice president and general manager of the Media Innovation Group (the MIG), a company he started in 2007. As the leader of the MIG, WPP’s first technology development organization dedicated to media buying and optimization, Lesser created the first integrated data management, targeting and ad delivery platform for media agencies. He was instrumental in creating the first and largest agency trading desk, the rapid success of which led to the formation of Xaxis. In this interview with FE BrandWagon’s Anushree Chandran, Lesser explains how programmatic buying scores over other digital media buying strategies, and howXaxis is focusing on developing mobile based products for the Indian market. Edited excerpts:
Can you tell us about Xaxis’s operations in India?
Xaxis India is two years old. We have nine employees in India and they work as a unit, but they also work very closely with our Asia Pacific hub in Singapore where we have 40 employees. Xaxis is a programmatic media and technology platform which connects advertisers and publishers to audiences across all addressable media channels through the expert use of anonymous consumer data, advertising technology and media relationships. We launched the business in India two years ago, and it was a very nascent market in terms of programmatic media buying. The ad serving technology is not as prevalent as some of the more advanced markets and this has made data collection and creation of audiences difficult. Our business two years ago was primarily a display business and very performance oriented but for GroupM’s clients. Our fastest growing business is Xaxis TV which is our online video business. Technology is much more prevalent in the market now and therefore the ability to collect data and create data segments is much better than it was two years ago.
How does Xaxiscustomise solutions for various markets?
Xaxis has a number of technologies and products.The products that we develop on the platform vary according to the market. In markets such as Germany and the UK, for example, the majority of our business is online video. Across Asia Pacific, it’s probably slightly more display than video. In the US, we have been very aggressive in developing mobile, digital, out of home and radio. In India, our focus is obviously on video which is very fast growing and a part of the advertising ecosystem. And given that it is such a mobile driven society, we are developing mobile products for Xaxis India.
Tell us how your product Sync works.
Sync is currently live in four markets. It is in the development phase in India and it will be launched in 2015. Sync is a product that allows us to serve advertising on a mobile device that corresponds to a television commercial. The problem we are solving is that if a consumer is at home watching TV, and a TV commercial comes, they get distracted and look at their mobile device whether that istheir phone or their tablet. We now have the ability to serve ads in real time that corresponds to the TV commercial.
Will all media buying eventually be programmatic?
Eventually, all advertising will be digital and all digital advertising will be bought and sold programmatically. At times, people confuse programmatic buying with real time bidding. Real time bidding is a subset of programmatic but is certainly not the whole of it. Ad inventory is available at an auction in an open market place and that primarily refers to display advertising and some video advertising. But these are only some aspects of programmatic. In the future, large advertisers will still have relationships with big media companies for a given market and they will negotiate deals so that their advertising appears in the most favourable brand safe environment. But they will buy that advertising and serve that advertising programmatically.Eventually, the process of sending an insertion order and reconciling things manually will evolve into programmatic but that doesn’t really mean that all media will be bought at an auction.
Why has WPP announced that it is pulling out of open ad exchanges?
Inventory is bought through an ad exchange and sometimes bought through an ad network. Clients ask us to give them leverage in rates in the media market place. We buy programmatically, but prefer it to be directly bought from the publishers. In an open exchange, there is no pricing advantage for large advertisers. If you are a large advertiser spending $100 million a year, you will probably get the same pricing advantage as an advertiser that spends $100 a year. This is precisely what is wrong with the open ad exchange model. You may have a data advantage because you gathered more data. But I do think that it is easier for an advertiser to control pricing and control where their ad is placedif they work as closely as possible with publishers and not through open ad exchanges.
How much media is bought programmatically? Which are the companies that have embraced it well?
If you were to look at digital media budgets, programmatic comprises 10% of digital media budgets within very advanced markets. It is around 5% in less advanced markets. Although programmatic is a small part of media buying in India, it is expected to advance very quickly. India can learn from the mistakes that publishers have made in other markets. They can control pricing and buyers through programmatic.
Facebook has done a lot in the programmatic area. They are one of our partners. Yahoo is one of the original
innovators in the programmatic space. News Corp has made a very public effort to push its business into programmatic.
How do you think native advertising will pan out?
I think that native advertising is an effective mechanism for publishers to monetize audiences and for advertisers to reach out to those audiences. Too many display ads are ignored by users. This is because the targeting is not very good, and in many cases, the creative is not very good. Native is a way for publishers to offer information in an unobtrusive fashion. It is also perfect for programmatic because not only can we target audiences depending on their profile or their segment, we can tailor the creative to the audience and literally manipulate what is there in the creative unit. I do think that native is a great innovation and will lend itself very well to programmatic.

For Indian men  controlling women is masculine: StudyLetters to  the editor
A new study has explored how the average Indian male interprets the idea of ‘masculinity’ and how that shapes his interactions with women.
The study, ‘Masculinity, Intimate Partner Violence and Son Preference in India’ by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW), shows a very high prevalence of violence against women in relationships across many states in the country.
Most of the 9,205 men interviewed showed that they were convinced that masculinity is about acting tough, freely exercising his privilege to lay down the rules in personal relationships, and controlling women.
Around two out of five men in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Punjab and Haryana, where the study was conducted, were found to be ‘rigidly masculine’ in their attitude and behaviour, as they firmly stated that women should neither be seen nor heard.
The study used a masculinity index to measure the degree of behavioural rigidity, based on levels of control men practice in intimate relationship and their attitudes towards gender equality.
“Gendered ideas of masculinity and childhood experiences are significant contributing factors behind men using violence. This research identifies alternative expressions of masculinity that offer pointers to effectively engage men and boys in achieving gender equality,” said Frederika Meijer, UNFPA India Representative.

China’s Trina Solar heeds PM Narendra Modi’s call, plans to ‘make in India’

Company Expansion
(Officials of the company,…)
NEW DELHI: Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to global manufacturers, Chinese company Trina Solar is planning to set up a facility over the next few years to "make in India, supply in India and even export from India".
Officials of the company, the world's fourth largest manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) modules, participated in the World Economic Forum held in Delhi last week to actively look for a joint venture partner and assess the Indian market.
"As far as 'make in India' is concerned, maybe we can make in India, supply in India and even export from India. We want globalised manufacturing, not only 'make in China'," Zhiguo Zhu , senior vice president of Trina Solar and the president of its module business unit told ET. Zhu added that from next year the company would start expanding outside China. "We want 20-30% of our production to take place outside of China.
India is one of the places we are exploring to do this," he said adding that the company expected to double its revenue share from India to 10%.
In India, where it has been operating for three years, Trina Solar has a market share of over 10%. Of the total 2,700 Mw solar power capacity in the country, it has supplied solar power to projects with 280 Mw capacity.
Zhu exhorted the government to sort out a few issues that he said would make India more conducive for business and attractive to foreign investors, even as he expressed confidence in the India growth story.
"We don't see India as one country because there are too many provinces and that makes doing business very complicated. We have to spend a lot of time to understand this. We want the government to make the process simple.
Then more people will come here for investment," he said. Zhu also spoke of the need for special incentives such as land and infrastructure to foreign companies to facilitate investments. India also needs a simplified taxation structure to create a better business environment, he added.
The New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE )-listed Trina Solar announced net revenues of $519.4 million for the second quarter of 2014. Its total shipments during this period stood at 943.3 Mw. In the third quarter, the company plans to report shipments of 1,060-1,120 Mw of PV modules.

Gold jewellery may not be as pure as sellers promiseBureau of Indian Standards
(The BIS, which plans to issue…)
NEW DELHI: The glittering gold jewellery that has burnt a hole in your pocket may not be as pure as the seller had promised, the country's leading gold refiner has alleged. According to MMTC PAMP, the scrap gold that the company gets for refining often contains 15-20% less gold than what 18 to 22-carat gold jewellery should have.
"MMTC-PAMP receives jewellery (plain gold) in the form of scrap for being refined into pure gold, and its average gold content has varied from 80% to 85%," said Rajesh Khosla , MD, MMTC PAMP.
Khosla said Indian jewellery buyers still face a challenge on gold content. "In Indian jewellery, gold content forms a significant component of its value due to high karatage, unlike in the West, where jewellery is of 12 to 14 karats," he said, adding that with making charges levied separately, assurance on its gold content becomes important.
Several officials at the Bureau of Indian Standards have backed this view, saying there have been instances of some retailers, who claim to have hallmark certification, selling products in which the gold content is lower than expected.
The BIS, which plans to issue a unique ID number for every hallmarked item—a move that will help curb duplication and aid in traceability, said the problem is rife. BIS director-general Sunil Soni said that "18%-20% of items picked from the market for random sampling have lower gold content than what is marked or don't conform to standards".
According to Soni, the percentage was higher and they were aiming to reduce it. "Earlier, we had powers to cancel the licence of a jeweller or hallmarking centre. But that was not enough. Now we are also imposing a penalty equal to three times the difference of in gold content that will be paid to the customer," he said.
MMTC PAMP's Khosla pointed out that consumers don't face a similar problem when they buy gold jewellery in Dubai , as penalties there for a wrong declaration are huge. As per BIS data, there are 13,000 licensed jewellers, who account for close to 26 million gold jewellery items sold in the country annually.
Customers have also pointed that to guarantee consistency in gold purity across an ornament, soldered joints and links should also be made of gold, and not cadmium, as is the current practice. On his issue, Soni said they were looking to move jewellers from using cadmium to gold.
Further, Khosla pointed that the assay and hallmarking system was based on statistical sampling, which means it was fallible. "The only nondestructive method is to assay the specific piece of jewellery with samples taken from different locations across the piece, then assaying the collective sample and using that result as representative of that piece only," he said.
"Most jewellers shy away from such intense scrutiny, and even if one was to persuade them, where is the assay centre that will do so? All of this is a tedious process, but that is why it is always a case of 'buyer beware' when buying Indian jewellery."

(The petition argues that…)
DELHI/KOLKATA: The government is considering a proposal to reserve 20% of gold that importing bodies sell in the market for small jewellers, according to an official, a move seen creating a level playing field in the industry. The move follows a petition filed in the Delhi High Court by the Delhi Bullion and Jewellers Welfare Association (DBJW).
The petition argues that gold import rules framed by the UPA government favour large trading organisations, and that they are forced to pay huge premium to procure the yellow metal.
The court had directed the government to look into the matter. "Currently, banks give preference to old and loyal customers while state agencies follow some other criteria, so we are trying to evolve some common principle or guidelines that will provide a fair play to smaller players", said an official of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). "We have had stakeholder consultations and have invited comments, based on which we will evolve guidelines though consensus."
In its petition, the DBJWA said banks and nominated agencies were given access to the local market as long as they made a fifth of the gold they imported available for export.
A large section of gold traders allege that most of this gold is picked up by the big jewellers, leaving the small players with no option but to pay huge premium to procure the metal.
Another official said that under the formula being considered, banks and star trading houses that have the Reserve Bank's mandate to import gold will have to earmark 20% of the gold imported for domestic usage by the small and marginal players.
At present, gold is made available to traders in accordance with the 80:20 rule, which says that importers must re-export a fifth of the gold bullion shipment before taking delivery of the next.
To check the widening current account deficit, the UPA government had raised the import duty on gold to 10% from 2% in stages, and also said 20% of every consignment of imported gold had to be exported, with only select banks allowed to import the metal.
The import restrictions, however, led to the CAD falling to 1.7% of GDP in 2013-14, against 4.7% in the previous fiscal.
Talking to ET, DBJWA general secretary Prem Prakash Sharma said, "The court had directed the ministries of finance and commerce, the DGFT and others to file a reply with issues that prompted them to allow a handful of star trading houses to import gold into India. Following this directive, there had been a series of meetings with the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India . In the last meeting with the DGFT, a formula has been worked out to tide over the present situation."
Pankaj Parekh , vice-chairman of Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said, "If a country's gold consumption is 950 tonnes, and only 400 tonnes are being imported, there is bound to be a premium. So those who can afford to give a premium get it, and small and marginal players feel left out.
The DGFT has found out a way and it will soon be incorporated." The modalities of the new formula are being worked out by a committee headed by Parekh. The committee includes members of banks and star trading houses.

With dollar on a tear  gold and silver rout far from over: Pollendorsements
(A significant portion even…)
NEW YORK: Gold's rout may be far from over, with many analysts and traders surveyed by Reuters predicting prices could fall to $1,000 per ounce by the end of the year, the first time at that level since 2009, even after Friday's 3-percent short-covering rally.
A rush of physical buying in the past week - from jewelry in Shanghai to coins in Germany - may prove to be a dead-cat bounce that is too feeble to offset a broader trend of selling by investors betting on further gains in the dollar, U.S. equities and an improving U.S. economy, according to the survey of more than two dozen analysts and traders.
Half of the 27 respondents surveyed on Wednesday and Thursday predicted gold prices will breach a critical support at $1,100 per ounce by the end of this year.
A significant portion even had $1,000 in their sights, which would be a five-year low and a level considered critical for miners. Only two saw prices recovering above the $1,200 mark.
Silver's fortunes may be even bleaker - most of those polled expect prices to fall another 10 percent to as low as $14 per ounce, which would be its lowest in over five years.
"U.S. dollar strength should impact gold on a short-term basis," said John Meyer, analyst at brokerage SP Angel.
The survey was carried out before spot gold rallied on Friday after hitting fresh 4-1/2-year lows around $1,130 an ounce as investors covered bearish bets after weaker-than-expected October U.S. jobs growth.
Prices may remain volatile and prone to rallies on spurts of short-covering, and weak prices have unleashed a flurry of physical demand for coins in Europe and the United States.
But with the dollar on a tear against global currencies and institutional cash being pulled from the market, any recovery may be short-lived for now.
"The drivers of a sustained rally in gold are ephemeral at best," said Tai Wong, director, metals trading at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
A strong dollar makes it more expensive for foreign buyers to own dollar-based gold.
Holdings in the world's No. 1 gold-backed exchange traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, which proved popular with investors during the financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, sank to their lowest in six years on Friday.
The poll highlighted how far gold has fallen out of favor with the end of the Federal Reserve's years-long bond-buying stimulus program.
At $1,000, gold would be off almost 50 percent from the all-time highs of $1,920 an ounce hit in 2011 when investors were piling in to protect against inflation and geopolitical and economic uncertainty.
"The mood of investors could not be more bearish for precious metals," said Thorsten Proettel, commodity analyst at LBBW.

Maruti  Hyundai see year in red as sales fall in OctPrices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated festive season failed to trigger demand for cars in October as sales declined for the second consecutive month amid a slow economic recovery and high interest rates, raising concerns the industry may see a third straight year of declines.
Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai Motor and other car companies sold a combined 1,59,036 vehicles last month, a drop of 2.55% from 1,63,199 units in October 2013, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said on Monday. Overall domestic auto sales fell 4% to 17.87 lakh vehicles last month, pummeled by a sharp 9% decline in bike dispatches, turning negative for the first time since December 2013, when a 4.24% fall was registered.
"This year, the festival season has been subdued compared to last year. If we don't see some real growth in economic activity and some relief in the high interest rates on automotive financing that could improve customers' sentiment, we might not see automobile sales going up in the coming months," SIAM deputy director-general Sugato Sen said.
Sen declined to provide a forecast, although SIAM had earlier estimated a 5-10% growth in passenger vehicle sales in the current financial year. Following declines in 2012-13 and 2013-14, car sales in the country had increased every month from May to August. Automobile sales dropped 1.03% in September.

Car sales growth this fiscal year is likely to be below 5 per cent, Sugato Sen, deputy director-general, SIAM, told reporters on Monday.
NEW DELHI: India's car sales are set to fall below the earlier growth target for FY15 set by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
Car sales growth this fiscal year is likely to be below 5 per cent, Sugato Sen , deputy director-general, SIAM, told reporters on Monday.
In August, the industry body said it expected domestic car sales to grow between 5 and 10 per cent, helped by an improved sentiment after the Narendra Modi government took office in May following a victory in the general elections.
"We are not being able to sustain only by creating positive sentiment," said Sen. "Unless the real economy starts growing... we may not see a very robust growth in the auto sector, especially the passenger vehicle market."
Sale of passenger vehicles, which includes cars and utility vehicles, fell 7.5 per cent in October to 221,151 units from a year ago, breaking a consecutive rise for five months. Passenger car sales were lower by 2.6 per cent.
Car sales are expected to rise this fiscal year after falling for two consecutive years, says SIAM.

Domestic passenger car sales declined 2.55 per cent to 1,59,036 units in October from 1,63,199 units in the year-ago month.
NEW DELHI: Car sales in India fell 2.55 per cent in October as purchases remained subdued during the festival season, marking the second consecutive month of decline.
According to the data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), domestic car sales in October this year stood at 1,59,036 units as compared to 1,63,199 units in the same month of 2013.
"Festival season has been subdued as compared to last year. Also, the sentiment has become positive but unless we have some real economic growth kicking in, we might not see automobile sales going up," SIAM Deputy Director General Sugato Sen told reporters here.
He added that sales would remain subdued for the next two months but may see some revival starting early next year.
"Though we might see some revival in sales early next year, the passenger vehicle segment and passenger cars are expected to grow at sub-5 per cent this fiscal," Sen said.
In August, SIAM had forecast a growth of 5-10 per cent in passenger vehicles and cars for the current financial year.
Car sales in the country grew from May to August this year after a prolonged slump which lasted over two years. The sales, however, declined 1.03 per cent in September.
In October, market leader Maruti Suzuki India posted a growth of 1.95 per cent in domestic passenger car sales at 80,589 units as against 79,040 units in the same month last year.
Rival Hyundai Motor India saw its sales grow by 5.34 per cent to 37,894 units as compared to 35,973 units in the same month last year.
Honda Cars India witnessed a decline of 8.45 per cent in domestic sales of its passenger cars at 10,186 units as against 11,127 units in the year-ago month.
Homegrown auto major Tata Motors' sales were down 12.33 per cent at 9,594 units as against 10,944 units in October 2013, while utility vehicles major Mahindra & Mahindra's sales during the month declined by 13.64 per cent to 19,029 units as against 22,035 units last year.
Motorcycle sales last month declined 8.73 per cent to 10,08,761 units from 11,05,269 units a year earlier, according to SIAM data.
"Motorcycle sales will remain subdued till the end of the year. It follows a pattern. Last year sales were up in October but fell in November and this year sales were up last month and fell in October," Sen said.
Market leader Hero MotoCorp saw its sales dip 11.42 per cent to 4,91,190 units as against 5,54,545 units in the same month last year.

Rate cut: Will it be Arun Jaitley Vs Raghuram RajanNovember 11, 2014, 4:53 am IST Govardhana Rangan in The Skeptic | Economy , Finance , India | ET
25
The buzzword in New Delhi now is empowerment. In a refreshing departure from the past, bureaucrats have the freedom to decide. But where does that leave the RBI governor? Indications are that there is nothing amiss so far — unlike when finance minister P Chidambaram wanted to run monetary policy to the chagrin of then-RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao.
With Arun Jaitley joining the chorus on the need for an interest rate cut, is it going to be another tug of war between an RBI governor and finance minister? It’s unlikely. But cordial relations can’t be taken for granted either.
For a government that trusts its officers to decide, to meddle in the affairs of governor Raghuram Rajan, especially on interest rates at this juncture, would be hara-kiri. Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have turned the investor tide, but Rajan had already done his bit to restore credibility. If India’s poor macroeconomy was half the reason for last year’s currency crisis, the rest was due to loquacious bureaucrats and an activist finance minister who nullified the central bank’s actions by publicly confronting it.
The singular demand from business is that policies on tax and economic activities be stable. But when it comes to monetary policy, it is different. It suits their interest, but not necessarily the economy’s. Just like a governor is not qualified to dictate how businesses are run, chief executives can’t wade into monetary policymaking. Rajan is paid to do that.
The cry for lower interest rates is due to the consumer price index (CPI) sliding below the RBI’s 8% target for January 2015. But there’s a long way to go on the inflation front. The target of 6% by January 2016 may also be possible given the slide in crude oil and tomato prices. Or so goes the argument. But a closer reading of the RBI will tell you that the long-term aim is to have it at 4%, in a band of 2 percentage point on either side. A premature rate cut would jeopardise that objective. If inflation is not below 4% for a decade or so, then returning to the cherished 8% economic growth will remain a dream.
Not many had forecast the fall in crude oil or tomato prices — which rose to .`80 a kg from .`20 in a matter of weeks. How would cheerleaders of interest rate cuts know that prices won’t surge in a matter of weeks? Rewind to April 2012 when Subbarao was browbeaten to cut interest rates without a firm handle on the direction of prices. There was also a flimsy argument that supply-side inflation could not be tamed by monetary policy. When the reality began to bite, Subbarao had to abandon cuts and publicly defy his boss. If the present government repeats this, there is no reason to believe that results would be any different.
What is at stake? There is near unanimity that lower interest rates will not lead to a jump in new projects. Not many are willing to invest in equity. Unless entrepreneurs bring in equity, banks won’t lend to indebted companies. So why force a reluctant governor and damage credibility?
What damage can a cut inflict now? If crude prices jump back to $100 a barrel or if tomato prices surge to .`40 due to poor harvest, the CPI may return to 8% by May or June. Does the RBI raise interest rates then? The repo rate can’t move like tomato prices. If it does, the currency and the economy will be back in the crisis square.
Carry trade has got a new life with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan revving up their currency-printing machines with the end of quantitative easing in the US. This could trigger another bout of speculative jump in commodity prices. And that poses a risk for India. In these circumstances, no principled central banker would lower interest rates, especially after years of battling doubledigit inflation and a currency crisis not so long ago. It would mean frittering away whatever little was achieved in the last 15 months.
Rajan may argue with Jaitley that the time for a rate cut is yet to come. And that when it comes — sometime in February or March when he would have inflation data for a few more months — he would cut rates by 75 or 100 basis points instead of a meaningless 25 basis points now. That could be abooster dose for the economy.

PM Modi s cabinet expansion guided by work  allies and caste balancePM Narendra Modi's cabinet expansion guided by work, allies and caste balance

(The PM has chosen to keep…)
By Neerja Chowdhury
There are four clear messages emanating from the Sunday cabinet expansion undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The first is an obvious one, the requirements of governance when more hands were needed on deck to man the important ministries which were being held by 7 or 8 people, and their workload was becoming too heavy to manage. Hence Manohar Parikkar and Suresh Prabhu, and they are leaders who have a clean image, who the PM trusts and enjoys a rapport with, and who are known to have administrative experience.
Six months into power, Narendra Modi has successfully managed to maintain a momentum, winning an endorsement even in state elections, of Maharashtra and Haryana. But he needs talent to translate his promises into results that people will demand to see very soon. Here Modi is working under constraints of not having enough people in the party who combine talent and experience and this too comes through the expansion exercise. The PM cannot bring people from outside because of the party's inability at this stage to ensure their election to the Rajya Sabha, which it may be able to do at a later stage, when it wins states, and vacancies occur.
The second is a political consideration— and this has taken into account the specifics of caste and community which cannot be sniffed away in the politics of Gangaland, no matter what the rhetoric. The idea is to buttress the party's efforts to wrest the big states of Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh which go to the polls in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively, without which the Modi agenda will remain incomplete.
So Bihar MPs like Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Giriraj Singh, Ram Kirpal Yadav have been inducted, in addition to the five already in the ministry from the state. So also from UP, it is Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, ostensibly to give a suitable signal to the minorities, though Naqvi is a Shia leader and he has only been made an MOS (which he was also in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government). Dr Mahesh Sharma, a first time MP also from UP, has however been given Independent charge, coming as he does under the coveted "technocrat" category. There are also saffron clad Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and Ram Shankar Katehriya, a dalit, made MOSs. As it is there were a whopping 9 ministers from UP already in the Modi government .
With a slump in Mayawati's fortunes in UP, dalits are clearly—and particularly-- on Modi's radar screen keeping in mind the state elections in the next two and a half years. The induction of Vijay Sampla, also a dalit from Punjab, goes to reinforce the "woo-dalit" plan of the party to neutralise the BJP's upper caste image. Punjab, where elections are due in 2017, has 30 % dalit voters, and here to the BJP may keep its options open on continuing the alliance with the Akali Dal. Sampla's entry is a snub to Akali Dal which had hoped for another minister this time round.
Given the good showing of BJP in West Bengal, Babul Supriyo's inclusion as MOS is also a signal to Mamata Bannerji's state of a resurgent BJP on the horizon, and the party's attempt is obviously going to be to push out the Left from the number two position. Supriyo has been known for his extraordinary connect with people through his singing.
Modi seems to have tried to zero in on those who had excelled in their respective fields Like Supriyo. Or Olympian shooter Col Rajyavardene RathoreThe decision to induct Rathore and Sanwarlal Jat from Rajasthan is being seen as bad news for Vasundhara Raje Scindia, for the CM had put her weight behind the inclusion of Col Sonaram Chaudhary, a Jat who she had fielded against Jaswant Singh in Barmer, and her son Dushyant Singh, who is the seniormost MP from Rajasthan today. All the 24 other BJP MPs who won from Rajasthan were either former MLAs or first time MPs.
The third message coming through the expansion is also clear—that the PM is now in the process of shaping what will be his own team, bringing in first timers, and those he has a rapport with like Parikkar and Prabhu. Their inclusion may alter the power balance at the top echelons of Government, including the apex Cabinet Committee on Security.
Fourth, Modi has given an unmistakeable message to the BJP's allies—that alliances will be on his own terms in a situation which has undergone a sea change, with people having given the party a clear mandate.

India’s largest online retail company, Flipkart, will probably attract $1.5 billion in new investments, after garnering over $1 billion in new funding recently. Companies like Snapdeal, or Quickr or Olx, among others, came to the market slightly later, and have different business models that might take some time to scale up. Flipkart too had a bad time a few years ago, when its logistics systems seemed to be crumbling during a recession. Amazon, which started operations in India last summer, has to, thanks to regulation, do its business through a large number of other sellers. Despite these cribs, there is no doubt that thanks to online retail, and the communications revolution that enabled it, the way city dwellers shop in India has changed forever.
In metropolitan India, an app called Zomato will give you a large choice of restaurants or kitchens where you can dine in or order from. Then there are Uber or Ola taxi-service aggregators that can give you the cheapest cab in the shortest time.
How far can this revolution spread from our metropolitan cities to the rest of the country? Not much. Few non-metro towns have regular taxi services. Even fewer have bookshops catering to a varied clientele. The spread of low-cost smartphones, along with widespread 3G and 4G services, could have enabled all this, but spectrum scarcity and a confused legal framework have held things at bay.
There is a darker side to the proliferation of social media apps. They were used in western Uttar Pradesh last year, to instigate riots using patently fake videos, alleging that Hindus and Muslims were at each others’ throats. The e-commerce and social networking networks are welcome. But not if they are used to spread hatred and disharmony among communities. Some regulation is due.

Vodafone Lifts Earnings Outlook Higher as Trading Improves
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 13:13 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
London: Vodafone nudged its forecasts for core earnings higher on Tuesday after reporting a sharp improvement in its main quarterly revenue measurement helped by growing demand for mobile services in its big European markets.
The British group reported second-quarter organic service revenue, which strips out items like handset sales and currency movements, down 1.5 per cent, compared with the near 4 or 5 per cent falls it recorded in the last six quarters. It also beat the consensus of a fall of 2.8 per cent.
The world's second-biggest mobile operator said it now expected its full-year core earnings to be between 11.6 billion pounds and 11.9 billion pounds, compared with the previous guidance of between 11.4 billion pounds and 11.9 billion pounds.
"We have made encouraging progress during the quarter," said Chief Executive Vittorio Colao. "There is growing evidence of stabilisation in a number of our European markets, supported by improvements in our commercial execution and very strong demand for data.
"Our two year, 19 billion pound investment programme is well underway, and customers are beginning to see the benefits."
Having sold its operations in the United States, Vodafone is investing some of the proceeds on new, faster 4G networks to satisfy customers' growing appetite for data.
But that has comes against the backdrop of cut-throat competition as operators battle weak demand in some struggling European economies. Regulatory changes, such as cutting the charges operators can impose to connect calls across networks, have also been a drag.
But results on Tuesday showed some of the pressures in its biggest European markets had eased. While service revenue remained negative in the four big markets of Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain, all four showed an improvement on the previous quarter.

SAT clubs KP Singh s petition with main case  hearing on Dec 10SAT clubs KP Singh, others' petition with main case, hearing on December 10

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT)on Tuesday bundled the petitions from DLF promoter-chairman K P Singh and four others with the main petition that the realty major has filed with the quasi judicial body on October 22 and put off the hearing on the matter to December 10.
DLF chairman K P Singh, his son and vice-chairman Rajiv Singh, younger daughter and whole-time director at DLF Pia Singh, company directors T C Goyal and Ramesh Sanka had earlier moved the tribunal challenging the October 10 Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) ban on them.
Market regulator Sebi had banned the company and six of its senior officials including the Chairman from accessing the capital markets for three years for alleged non-disclosure of three of its hundreds of subsidiaries in the 2007 IPO filing.
Admitting their petitions, the quasi-judicial body SAT directed Sebi to submit respond to these new bunch of petitions on December 6 and directed the petitioners to file their rejoinders on the 8th, and fixed December 10 for hearing on their petitions along with the main case.
On November 5, the tribunal had allowed DLF to redeem Rs 1,806 crore from its mutual fund investments to meet its working capital requirement and to service its debt, till December 31.
DLF had sought permission to redeem money locked in MFs after being slapped with the three-year ban by Sebi. The final hearing in DLF's main appeal against the order would commence on December 10, prior to which Sebi and the company will have to file their replies with the SAT.
As an interim measure, SAT has allowed the company to redeem mutual funds worth Rs 767 crore in November and further funds worth Rs 1,039 crore in December.
 
Sebi order did not ban DLF from continuing its business, but only barred it from accessing the capital markets for three years, a three-member SAT bench said explaining the rationale for the interim relief.
It can be reasonably concluded that the appellant (DLF) should be allowed to use its own funds to meet its every day needs and other working capital requirements, including meeting its obligations to the creditors.
Accordingly, this tribunal justifies the appellant's demand to redeem Rs 1,806 crore from MFs and also allow its lenders to de-freeze/invoke pledged shares of its subsidiaries as and when required, Presiding Officer JP Devadhar had said.
The tribunal had also noted that Sebi counsel Rafique Dada did not object to the interim relief. We are not opposing the plea for interim relief presuming that the tribunal is satisfied with the case made out by the appellant and not that we agree with all the points made, Dada said.
Sebi took action against DLF for active and deliberate suppression of material information at the time of 2007 IPO, which fetched it Rs 9,187 crore, the biggest IPO at that time.

6 ways: How to stop your sugar craving
Experts from the fields of nutrition and fitness say there are ways of reducing sugar craving, reports femalefirst.co.uk (Text: IANS)
Denial is not the answer: Denying yourself sweet foods completely is likely to result in sugar cravings and encourage bingeing. A little of the sweet stuff is fine in moderation and a small serving of your favourite pudding will help satisfy a sweet tooth. Have with a meal to reduce the effect on blood sugar levels. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Get enough sleep: According to Martin Budd, naturopath and author of "Why Am I So Exhausted", when we are tired, we often use sugar. So make sure you actually do build in proper sleep. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Get spicy: You could also try flavouring food and drinks with vanilla or spices such as nutmeg or cinnamon and cardamom. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Take care of nutrient deficiencies: Nutrient deficiencies can make cravings worse and the fewer nutrient deficiencies, the fewer cravings. Certain nutrients seem to improve blood sugar control including chromium, vitamin B3 and magnesium. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Keep moving: Often our little sugar treats especially after a meal are often more a habit or a way of dealing with emotional issues. Before you take a bite, stop and think about why you are doing this and work through that emotion. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
Try a detox: Max Tuck, author of book "Whole Body Solutions", says that introducing lots of greens into the diet, raw and preferably juiced with vegetables such as celery and cucumber, are not only detoxing but help to regulate blood sugar by providing protein, and also minerals that are responsible for maintenance of blood sugar levels. Likewise, the green leaves provide an excellent source of magnesium, the "stress mineral" that many people are deficient in. Juicing greens provides whole-body benefits. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Addressing competing demandsUpdated: November 11, 2014 00:56 IST
Addressing competing demands
government
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first expansion of his Council of Ministers has his unmistakable imprint, with some difficult allies firmly put in their place and immigrants from other parties rewarded. In his quest for as coalition-free a government as possible, Mr. Modi evidently intends to use the BJP’s impressive electoral mandate to minimise the role of tantrum-throwing partners. And so, the Shiv Sena’s demand for a second Cabinet berth at the Centre and key portfolios in the Maharashtra government in exchange for its support were brushed aside, even as Suresh Prabhu from that party, an administratively experienced if politically marginal leader, was inducted into the BJP on Sunday morning and sworn in as Railway Minister hours later. Ex-Congress veteran Birendra Singh, who joined the BJP before the Lok Sabha polls, has been given not just Cabinet status but the key portfolios of rural development, panchayati raj, drinking water and sanitation. Ram Kripal Yadav, who defeated RJD boss Lalu Prasad’s daughter in Bihar on the BJP symbol — after being denied the RJD ticket — is now a Minister of State. Inderjit Singh Rao, who exchanged the hand for the lotus before the elections, had become an MoS with independent charge in the first round itself.
The expansion also reflects the fact that “minimum government” does not always produce “maximum governance”: the government has acquired 21 fresh faces, taking the strength of the Ministry to 66, as some overburdened senior Ministers have been relieved of additional responsibilities. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has shed defence, Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad law, Shipping and Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari rural development, and Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar information and broadcasting. Of course, in acknowledgement of Mr. Jaitley’s status as Modi confidant and his skills as a communicator, he will also steer the I&B Ministry. The choice of new entrants also points to competing demands of inducting talent, increasing geographical and caste representation, and addressing the BJP’s core Hindutva constituency. If the entry of former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar as Defence Minister, the Harvard-educated Jayant Sinha as MoS for finance and Mr. Prabhu mark infusion of talent, the Ministry’s social composition has been enhanced — four more Brahmins, three of whom are in the Cabinet, two Jats to compensate for a non-Jat Chief Minister in Haryana, and more OBCs and Dalits. The only woman to be included, Niranjan Jyoti, is a saffron-clad sadhvi. And the controversial Giriraj Singh, a Bhoomihar from Bihar, had endeared himself to the new dispensation when he declared that all those who did not like Mr. Modi should just go to Pakistan.

Firm With Unlimited Leaves: How It HiresGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
Who wouldn't want to work for a company that allows unlimited leaves! Billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Group allows exactly that, and in a recent blog post, he shared how the company hires its senior-level staff. ( Read: Virgin Allows Unlimited Leaves )
"At Virgin, I have always insisted on being involved with senior-level hiring decisions at all of our companies, even if it sometimes means flying the applicants all the way to Necker Island to spend time with me (something about which I have received very few complaints!)," the Virgin Group founder wrote on his website .
Necker Island is Mr Branson's private island which he calls "my home-and favourite hideaway". The island can accommodate up to 30 guests.
For business leaders who don't like to get hands-on with the hiring process, Mr Branson had some food for thought. "If you're reading this and thinking, 'But my company is big, and I am way too important to busy myself with something as mundane as hiring staff - that's what we have a 'people department' for, isn't it?,' you should think again."
Virgin Group isn't the only one with such a hiring process; at Google too, co-founder and CEO Larry Page insists on being the final arbiter for leadership-role hirings.
"I know from personal conversations with Larry that he sees his involvement in the hiring process not as some symbolic role that he has to make time for, but rather as one of the most important aspects of his job," Mr Branson said.
One of the first things Mr Branson learned as an entrepreneur was the need to delegate duties for the venture to survive and grow, he said adding that hiring should be done with an "eye to the day that you're going to delegate even your CEO position".
Started as a record company in 1970, Virgin's business has diversified into areas like travel, telecom, financial services, since then. Virgin Group has its presence in over 50 countries and employs more than 50,000 people.

HPCL to take 8 pc stake in Petronet s Gangavaram LNG terminalEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
State-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) may pick up 8 per cent stake in Petronet LNG Ltd’s Rs 5,000 crore liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Gangavaram in Andhra Pradesh.
“HPCL has evinced interest in taking stake in the terminal as they have a huge requirement of gas at Visakhapatnam refinery,” a top Petronet official said.
The Viskhapatnam refinery of HPCL, which is only a few kilometers away from Gangavaram port, is being expanded to 15 million tonnes per annum from current 8.33 million tonnes and the expanded unit will have a gas requirement of close to 2.5-3 million standard cubic meters per day.
“We have earmarked a total of 24 per cent shareholding for strategic investors and ports. Out of this, the Gangavaram port has already taken 8 per cent and a similar stake is being offered to LNG suppliers. So HPCL can get 8 per cent equity,” he said.
Andhra Pradesh government too has evinced interest and is likely to get 5 per cent stake, leaving Petronet with 69 per cent shareholding.
Years ago, HPCL had missed the LNG bus when it got left out of the PSU consortium that formed Petronet. Indian Oil, ONGC, GAIL and Bharat Petroleum each have 12.5 per cent stake in Petronet.
The official said gas utility GAIL India Ltd has evinced interest in booking half of the 5 million tonnes a year import capacity of the proposed terminal.
“We are in discussions with GAIL but nothing has been finalised as yet,” he said.
The Gangavaram project received all approvals of the state government only last month, a good one-and-half-year behind schedule, and Petronet is now looking to build an import facility by 2018.
This will be Petroent’s first import facility on the east coast. It already has a 10 million tonnes a year terminal at Dahej in Gujarat and a 5 million tonnes unit at Kochi in Kerala.
Petronet is expanding Dahej to 15 million tonnes by end of 2016 and plans to add another 2.5 million tonnes capacity at a cost of about Rs 1,100 crore.
The official said the company is looking for strategic partners who can either bring in gas turned into liquid at minus 160 degrees Celsius (liquefied natural gas or LNG) or buy a minimum quantity of the imported fuel to be sold in the domestic market.

Bank Strike May Hit Trading Volumes on Wednesday
Reuters | Updated On: November 11, 2014 17:05 (IST)
Government May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
Mumbai: Dealers are bracing for low volumes across all markets in India on Wednesday as unions at most banks have called for a nationwide strike that is expected to leave trading rooms with minimal staffing but not shut down activity altogether.
The strike is expected to hit all state-run banks, and also some private lenders, and could also impact market functions such as trade settlements to some extent, the dealers said.
Still the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will operate as usual and can provide funds via its overnight repo window, traders also said.
"There will be minimum presence in the treasury department to run the necessary functions," said a dealer at a state-run bank.
"So volumes will be affected in government securities, call and forex."
Trade unions have called a bank strike on Wednesday for all state-controlled lenders over a set of demands including higher wages and a five-day work week.
Vishwas Utagi, one of the leaders of a union representing state-run lenders, said he expected 1 million employees to participate in the strike, although the number could not be independently verified.

Standard Chartered to axe up to 100 branches in 2015Standard Chartered to axe up to 100 branches in 2015 under revival plan
Steve Slater     London   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 19:49 IST

Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered plans to cut up to 100 retail branches in 2015, or 8 per cent of its network, to help save $400 million a year to improve profitability.
The bank is under pressure to improve performance after three profit warnings this year and a 30-per cent plunge in its shares, and is holding three days of meetings with investors in Hong Kong to spell out its plans.
"We recognise our recent performance has been disappointing and are determined to get back on to a trajectory of sustainable, profitable growth, delivering returns above our cost of capital," Finance Director Andy Halford said in slides accompanying his presentation to investors.
Ten years of record earnings for Standard Chartered came to an abrupt halt in summer 2012 when it had to pay $667 million for violating US sanctions on Iran. It has since been hit by a surging bad debts in key markets such as China and India.
Standard Chartered said in its slides that returns at its retail bank were being held back by high costs and that it aimed to cut 80-100 branches, out of 1,248 it had at the end of June.
Halford said the bank was aware of investor concerns, including whether its cost cutting plans went far enough and whether its capital was high enough. He also acknowledged their concerns over a rise in bad debts and non-performing loans and whether management was doing enough to tackle problems.
"We understand and are responding to the challenges we are facing. You will see further progress in 2015," he said.
The slides said the bank aimed to increase assets under management in its wealth management and private banking businesses by 10 per cent or more next year, from $66 billion and $56 billion, respectively, at the end of June.
It is also aiming to get more out of its corporate finance bankers. It wants that business to show a 10 per cent or more increase in deals and a similar rise in revenues from its eight priority markets and in revenues per banker.
In retail, where Standard Chartered has more than 10 million customers in 34 countries, it plans to put more focus on its 1.6 million priority retail customers and 400,000 business clients.
At 1030 GMT, Standard Chartered shares were little changed.

death and dying
Interview Kate Gilmore, Deputy Executive Director UNFPA
Kate Gilmore, the Deputy Executive Director, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is in New Delhi to participate in the ongoing global conference on engaging men and boys in gender equality. She spoke to The Hindu about the rights of women, the need to include reproductive sexual education in schools to bring down teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections and about the recent deaths of women who had gone for a sterilisation surgery camp in Chhattisgarh. On why it is important for men to participate in gender equality campaigns, she says it implicates everyone and “there is no place to run”.
Q: Your visit to India coincides with the death of eight women who had undergone sterilisation surgeries at a camp. What is your reaction?
It is a tragedy that has occurred, of course the reports need to be validated and there needs to be an investigation carried out independently to understand what took place. If this is the case, it a great human tragedy, a grave crime and cause of sorrow.
Separate from the circumstances, which we don’t know, to die from sterilisation conducted properly is extremely rare. Look at WHO’s data, this is a clinical science done at quality standards. India has fantastic and elaborate instructions on what those standards are; so if someone has died of sterilisation, something grave has gone wrong.
What troubles me is something still not taking call powerful enough about a shift in the public health approach that needs to be adopted for women to have what they need to make choices.
Q: Can governments carry out sterilisations camps? Is it the most popular form of contraception ?
First, in International standards, what UNFPA also upholds, a woman must have free prior and informed choices between at least three forms of modern contraception. Anything less than this risks being coercive, or can be seen as created to induce her.
It is choice; all the talks about family planning are meant to be about choice, not methods.
Secondly, quality, we must have great quality for those choices. Perhaps these women [in Chhattisgarh] chose sterilisation, the only popularity that one should see is if it is popular with the women. You know it is popular if that is the method they choose. If sterilisation was chosen over the pill, which was chosen over the condom, fine, but if there was only sterilisation then it was imposition.
There must be assurance of quality. If it appears and the investigation validates it, that the women had sepsis or life threatening hemorrhage then, it was not conducted at quality. The choice must be for quality sterilisation not life threatening sterilisation.
The third point is accountability. To uphold choices and quality you must have accountability for those who offer the service, plan the service and pay for the service. Accountability has to include legal accountability; there cannot be impunity for those who have conducted the service at low standards.
Choice, quality and accountability that is what family planning is.
Q India is likely to miss the fifth Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for maternal mortality, what are your concerns about India?
India has had a massive change under the MGD, it is incredible what has been achieved for education. Let’s celebrate that, but is it enough, no. We have fewer children dying of preventable causes, but we still have children dying on the first day or within the first year of their life.
We have many more women with access to skilled birth attendants and clinical support and fantastic outcomes, but still far from enough. No one should ever die giving birth.
In India, we have the means and the know-how and so much skill and expertise. India can put a rocket into space, it has invented the use of communication technology to drive new ways to accessing data; look at how you are doing census. How can it be, that a single woman living in India is dying from the most natural processes of giving birth. It is unacceptable.
Q Adolescent sex education continues to remain a sensitive issue in India. How do you propose to address that?
Earlier this year India launched a ground breaking, global best practice policy through adolescent sexual reproductive health. It is exciting, but it is 2014, how come we are still having to advocate at state level and down to provincial level and then schools that young people need to know about their bodies. How can it be a bad idea? How come we still have to convince parents and teachers that a girl ought to understand that she is sexually active, or a boy should understand what consent means in the context of sex or both boys and girls should know how to avoid sexually transmitted infections?
When you have human rights based, age appropriate sex education in schools teenage pregnancy and SITs go down because young people know how to make better choices for themselves and to stand up against those who impose sex upon them.
Yet, there are people who think comprehensive sex education does not belong in schools.
This is going to take a lot of political leadership, courage, budget, capabilities in teachers and principals and participation of community leaders and politicians.
Q What are your views on legalization of prostitution?
It is quite clear to the UNFPA that criminalisation of prostitution is an imperfect public policy tool if you want to stop gender based violence, STIs and keep women and girls safe. Even the category prostitution is so imprecise; the police, people in the street and doctors and nurses making arbitrary decisions on who they believe is promiscuous, pure or prostitute is imperfect. Who are we to judge in that regard?
What we do know is that every person, without exception is born with inalienable human rights. No one can take them away from us. And it [legalisation] does not include the right to be a prostitute per se, but the right to have sexual reproductive health, to live without fear and without violence. And that is true for us all.
Criminalisation of one category of people or behaviour must be done as the absolute last resort. What does science tell us, criminalisation does not deter prostitution, it does not help minimise the bad consequences of commercial sex work like STIs. On the contrary if you decriminalise you can regulate and keep people safe.
Q You have a meeting with the Health Ministry officials? What is on the agenda?
We will speak about the sterilisation issue. We know that the government understands that the global agenda for family planning is about choice, quality and assurance. We will offer support for the government’s work with the states, so that the state level health policies are compliant with normative standards.

Sena fields its candidate even as CM Fadnavis seeks unanimous vote
Mumbai, November 11:  
The vote of confidence for the BJP-led Government in Maharashtra will be held on Wednesday but the Shiv Sena and BJP have not managed to resolve their differences and come together for a coalition in the State.
The last chances for a patch-up have also receded with both parties filing separate candidates for the position of Assembly Speaker.
On Tuesday, BJP MLA from Aurangabad Haribhau Bagde filed his nomination papers for the post, while the Shiv Sena nominated its MLA Vijay Auti from Ahmednagar.
The deadline for submitting nominations was extended by three hours after the Shiv Sena raised certain technical issues.
The Congress had said that it would support the NCP candidate. Since the NCP did not put up a candidate, it decided to field former minister Varsha Gaikwad from Dharavi in Mumbai for the post.
The Speaker’s election is a crucial litmus test for the Devendra Fadnavis Government. The Chief Minister will have to prove his strength on the floor of the Assembly on Wednesday morning before facing the crucial vote of confidence in the afternoon.
In spite the rancour between his party and the Sena, Fadnavis was very upbeat about both elections. He told media persons that all parties should ensure that a unanimous candidate is elected for the august post of Speaker.
He said he would speak to Shiv Sena and Congress leaders for arriving at a consensus candidate.
At the time of going to press, Shiv Sena MLAs were holding a meeting with the party’s leadership for devising a strategy for the vote of confidence motion. The party had issued a whip asking all its MLAs to remain present in the Assembly during the crucial hours on Wednesday.

I am confident of winning vote trust: FadnavisMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will have to establish his government's majority on the floor of the state legislature assembly on Wednesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:51 pm
The chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said the BJP would win the vote trust and that he was not going to break or poach upon any political party for eliciting support to cross the magic figure of 145. Fadnavis said, “ Yes, I am absolutely confident of winning the vote of trust on Wednesday.”
Fadnavis (44) who was sworn-in as the chief minister of Maharashtra on October 31, will have to establish his government’s majority on the floor of the state legislature assembly on Wednesday.
Officially, BJP has kept its plans ready to win the vote trust both with or without Shiv Sena, NCP. However, late night saw BJP evolving further strategies to consolidate its support base reaching out for support across parties including Sena.
During an informal talks, taking time out of his hectic schedule, Fadnavis said, “ I have the strategy in place. We are confident of number game and sure to win the confidence motion, I see no threat to the stability of the government.”
Throughout the day Fadnavis received stream of MLAs across party lines pledging support to his government. The chief minister indicated, there were feelers from members representing political parties including Shiv Sena who expressed desire to support the government. However, I am not in favour of breaking any political party. I am not in favour of breaking Shiv Sena, he added.
Till, late night BJP had already elicited support from smaller groups and independents. The BJP has 121 MLAs out of 288 MLAs in state assembly. However, support from smaller groups and individuals saw the BJP taking its tally upto 135 MLAs. The list of MLAs who made a beeline to give support to BJP across parties ensured the government would cross the half way mark of 145 MLAs. The MLAs from Vidarbha cutting across party lines wanted to lend a helping hand to Fadnavis government.
A senior Congress leader said, “ Although we have issued whip to our MLAs, if any body remains absent citing valid reasons we cannot disqualify them.” There were concerns expressed from Sena also with a section fearing some MLAs remaining “absent” would make it easier for BJP as it would drastically bring down the half way mark.
The rules mandate that half way mark is counted on total MLAs present during the voting in the state assembly. If total members present are 288 the half way mark would be 145. But if total members present come down to 265 to 270 with 15 to 18 remaining absent, the half way mark would come down to 135. The BJP is trying to win the vote trust with its own party MLAs plus smaller groups and independents.

Nifty ends at new high; Sensex rises 35 pointsMARKET UPDATE: Nifty ends at new high; Sensex rises 35 points
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 22:26 IST

The BSE Sensex on Tuesday gained 35 points in a volatile trade while the NSE Nifty settled at record closing high of 8,362.65 points on continued foreign funds inflows ahead of inflation and IIP data on Wednesday.
The 50-share Nifty continued its record-setting run for the second straight session and ended up by 18.40 points, or 0.22 per cent, at all time high of 8,362.65. It shuttled between 8,378.70 and 8,321.85 in day trade.
The BSE barometer Sensex opened on a strong footing and rose to intra-day high of 27,996.92.
But later it succumbed to profit-booking at near record levels and touched a low of 27,790.40 before settling at 27,910.06, a gain of 35.33 points, or 0.13 per cent, over previous close. The 30-share index had closed at record high of 27,915.88 on November 5.
A positive momentum after government's reforms process and a firming trend at global markets buoyed the trading sentiment, brokers said. Global crude prices dropping to four-year low also helped the positive momentum, they added.
Brent crude for the December delivery eased 22 cents to four-year low of $82.12.
Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth Rs 355.30 crore on Monday, according to the stock exchanges' data.
However, profit-booking at some counters ahead of inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September to be released on Wednesday, slowed down the rally to some extent.
Of 30 Sensex stocks, 16 scrips led by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, HDFC Bank, GAIL, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, L&T, Tata Power, Tata Steel, TCS and Sun Pharma gained.
On the other hand, Infosys, ITC Ltd, Bharti Airtel, BHEL, Coal India, Dr Reddy's, Hero MotoCorp, Wipro and Sesa Sterlite finished lower.
Sectorwide, the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 1.05 per cent, followed by Banking index by 0.74 per cent and Auto index by 0.68 per cent.
Indicating firm sentiments, the breadth of the market was positive with BSE midcap index rising 0.72 per cent and smallcap index by 0.24 per cent.

Official panel finalises floor  reserve price for coal blocksOfficial panel finalises floor, reserve price for coal blocks
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, November 11:  
An inter-ministerial panel on Tuesday arrived at the formula to fix the floor price for e-auction of coal blocks as well as the reserve price for allocation to public sector companies.
The price is expected to be announced within a fortnight, a senior official told BusinessLine, while declining to spell out the rates.
According to the formula, the e-auction price will be determined on the basis of the current value of the asset on offer, the international mine head price, and the three-year average of imported coal price.
While a component for deriving the reserve price will be based on asset valuation, it will also factor in the gross calorific value (GCV) of coal for computing the net value to avoid any adverse impact on power tariffs. GCV is adopted internationally and is linked to the quality of the coal.
After the meeting of the inter-ministerial panel, comprising officials from the Ministries of Coal, Power, Petroleum & Natural Gas, and Finance as well as officials of Coal India and Central Mine, Planning and Design Institute, a Cabinet note will be circulated shortly, a senior Coal Ministry official said.

Nikkei Soars to Seven-Year Highs on Tax-Relief HopesGold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
Tokyo: Japanese stocks jumped on Wednesday as investors cheered reports that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will delay a planned sales tax rise to rejuvenate Japan's fragile economic recovery, and call a snap election to secure his political position.
Mr Abe will postpone a planned second sales tax hike by eighteen months and call a general election on the issue next month, the Sankei newspaper reported.
The Nikkei benchmark gained 1.4 per cent to 17,356.75 by 0157 GMT, hitting fresh seven-year highs.
"That the market would fall on a sales tax rise was a big fear. This is hugely positive," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management.
Given a fragmented opposition, a snap election could cement Mr Abe's grip on power, despite declining approval ratings.
With third quarter GDP figures due on Monday expected to show the economy still struggling to shake off the pain of the April sales tax rise, a delay in the second-stage tax hike was seen as positive for Japan's stuttering recovery.
Economists have warned that given the parlous state of Japan's public finances, fiscal consolidation through tax increases is essential if the country is to maintain its credibility in international debt markets.
For now, however, market players were focused on policy steps to recharge Japan's economy.
"Markets are here and now. They're watching liquidity and reform," said Gavin Parry, managing director of Parry International Trading, referring to the Bank of Japan's radical easing steps and Abe's planned structural reform policies.
Japanese stocks were also encouraged by a solid Wall Street performance, and the dollar's rise to a seven-year high of 116.11 yen overnight.
The dollar was last at 115.84 at 0056 GMT
The weak yen helped Japanese exporter shares, such as Toyota Motor Corp, which jumped 1.6 per cent and Panasonic, up 1.0 per cent.
Fujifilm Holdings shone, its shares jumping 4.7 per cent after it said its Avigan anti-influenza drug will likely be approved for treating Ebola patients early next year.
The broader Topix gained 1.0 per cent to 1,388.23, while the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 1.0 percent to 12,680.66.

Gold Eases as Dollar Firms; Investors Wary of Rallies

Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
Singapore: Gold retreated from sharp overnight gains early on Wednesday as the US dollar edged closer on a four-year high. Gold has struggled to hold rallies with the dollar close to multi-year highs and big outflows from bullion funds.
Spot gold fell 0.2 per cent to $1,161.60 an ounce by 0044 GMT, after gaining 1.2 per cent on Tuesday from a softer dollar. The metal has been unable to make a convincing break from a 4-1/2 year low of $1,131.85 reached last week.
A stronger dollar and equities, along with optimism over the US economic recovery, have hurt gold.
The dollar index remained near a four-year peak of 88.190 hit last Friday, while the greenback was close to a seven-year high against the yen.
SPDR Gold Trust, the world's top gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.12 per cent to 724.46 tonnes on Tuesday - a fresh six-year low.
The bullion industry's annual conference agreed prices would nurse losses over the next year.
Lower prices have led South Africa's AngloGold Ashanti to plan staff cuts through voluntary severances.
The London Bullion Market Association will stop producing its gold lending rates data from January 30 as banks shy away from the risks of providing financial benchmarks, a source close to the situation said on Tuesday.
Physical demand has shown signs of picking up as prices have somewhat stabilised, after last week's muted response to lower prices.

Oil Prices Down Amid Over-Supply ConcernsOil Price Drop Threatens $150 Billion in Investments
Singapore: Oil prices fell in subdued Asian trade Wednesday following sustained speculation about the dim prospects for an OPEC oil production cut in the face of abundant global supplies.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for December delivery fell 46 cents to $77.48 while Brent crude for December was down 39 cents to $81.28 in late-morning trade.
"Oil prices continue to tumble on concerns over modest demand and no signs of clipping supply at OPEC," said Desmond Chua, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore.
Trading volumes were thin in Asian trade with few fresh leads for dealers to track following the Veterans Day public holiday in the United States.
Investors are keeping a close eye on comments by OPEC members ahead of the cartel's next meeting in Vienna on November 27, with dissent evident in the 12-nation group on the need for a production cutback.
"I hope that (oil) prices will not reach a level where they harm (the) national economy," Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali al-Omair told the official KUNA news agency on Tuesday. Oil income makes up around 94 per cent of the country's public revenues.
Omair attributed the slide in oil prices to oversupply and a weak global economy.
He said OPEC would discuss oil prices and "take appropriate decisions that serve the economic interests of its members" when they meet at the end of the month.
A production cut by the cartel would run against its kingpin Saudi Arabia's recent price cuts for crude exports to the US market.
The move was seen by market observers as an effort to maintain market share as it faces competition from cheaper oil from US shale fields.
Elsewhere, the US Department of Energy's closely watched weekly report on oil inventories, normally released on Wednesdays, will be published Thursday due to the Veterans Day holiday.

Panel to Seek Cabinet Nod for Coal Reserve Price Methodology: ReportGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: An inter-ministerial panel on Tuesday decided the methodology for fixing reserve price for an upcoming coal auction and will seek approval of the Cabinet for the same.
The committee met on Tuesday and decided on the methodology for fixing the auction start price, or reserve price, for allotting coal blocks whose allotments were quashed by the Supreme Court in September, sources close to the development said.
The panel comprises secretaries of finance, power, steel, law, mines, petroleum, industrial policy and promotion and coal ministries.
"The Cabinet will take the final call on fixing methodology for reserve price," a source said.
Government had in 2012 constituted the inter-ministerial panel (IMC) to consider and examine the formulation of methodology for fixing floor/reserve price of coal blocks to be allocated through auction.
Based on recommendations of consultant Crisil, it had proposed allotting coal blocks only to government companies or to power plants with tariff-based bidding, to ensure that the benefit of cheaper domestic coal is passed on to consumers.
However, after the Supreme Court on September 24 cancelled allocation of 204 coal blocks, it was felt that there would be many existing power plants, which were linked to these mines, or power plants that have no tie-ups for coal and would either have cost-plus power purchase agreements (where tariff is fixed by power regulator) or would have contracted agreements to sell electricity on the basis of bid tariff.
Sources said it was felt that the methodology decided by the IMC previously needs to be reopened and a new be adopted.
The apex court had quashed allotment of 204 coal blocks to various companies between 1993 and 2009. Of these, 37 are running coal mines and another five are ready to produce by April.
Sources said the government wants to clear all roadblocks and meet conditions precedent for the new owner of the mines, which will be decided through an e-auction, to takeover operations of the 42 mines from April next year.
The 37 running mines produced about 38.14 million tonnes of coal in 2013-14, while the five others are likely to chip in with another 5.85 million tonnes.
Keen to avoid any supply disruption, the government on October 21 promulgated an Ordinance to revert half of these 42 mines to the government entities that were the original allottees. The remaining 21 will be put on auction in the first phase of bidding that will be open for end users in power, cement and steel sectors.
If the winner of these 21 mines is different than the one already operating, the existing owner will be paid compensation and operations handed over to the winner, they said.

Missouri governor: Police prepared for response to grand jury decision on Ferguson shootingBy Mark Berman November 11 Follow @markberman
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. (David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP)
As the  grand jury decision  looms regarding the August shooting of Michael Brown, an announcement that will likely be followed by renewed protests on Ferguson’s streets, authorities said they want to allow people to protest peacefully but stressed that they were preparing to respond to any violence.
“Our dual pillars here are safety and speech,” Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon.
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon outlined law enforcement plans Tuesday ahead of the announcement of a grand jury decision in the Michael Brown shooting case. (AP)
Nixon said that law enforcement officers have extensively prepared for the response to the grand jury decision. State and local agencies would coordinate through a unified command, with the Missouri National Guard remaining available as a “contingency plan” if necessary, he said.
A grand jury in St. Louis County is deciding whether to charge Darren Wilson, a Ferguson police officer , in the shooting and killing of Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old. The shooting on Aug. 9 sparked a series of heated protests that eventually garnered international attention as throngs of angry protesters faced off each night with heavily armed police officers wielding tear gas. The police response was criticized, with President Obama calling the scenes disturbing and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.  expressing concerns regarding the use of military equipment.
The National Guard was eventually called on as the nightly clashes persisted, one of several steps that Nixon took to try and stave off additional unrest. In the days after Brown’s death, Nixon announced a curfew (which was dropped two days later ) and put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of securing Ferguson .
While Nixon discussed the importance of letting people protest peacefully and said Tuesday that most people who planned to protest were going to be respectful, his introductory remarks heavily focused on maintaining order during the expected response. Nixon said that his primary job is ensuring public safety and said peaceful protests in the days after Brown’s death “were marred by senseless acts of violence and destruction,” pointing to fires that were set and gunshots fired during the unrest.
“That ugliness was not representative of Missouri and it cannot he repeated,” he said. Nixon also promised Tuesday that authorities were making progress on the larger issues raised by the shooting.
It is still unclear when the decision on a possible indictment will be announced, Nixon said. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said a day earlier that the decision would come in mid-to-late November, but he did not offer a specific date. The grand jury has until January to make a decision on possible charges, but McCulloch has pointed multiple times to a decision coming this month.
Few in the St. Louis area are expecting that Wilson will be charged, so residents and activists have been talking with police about ways to allow demonstrations while preventing any violence. Protests have continued since the height of the response to Brown’s death, with many activists focusing on removing McCulloch from the case .
Nixon would not discuss the role of the Ferguson Police Department during his Tuesday news conference, and that department was not among the agencies represented or highlighted as part of the planned police response. Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, is expected to  leave his post , according to law enforcement officials.
The Justice Department is conducting a larger investigation into the policing practices of the Ferguson Police Department. In addition, investigators are also carrying out a civil rights investigation, though officials said that it is unlikely this investigation will result in any charges .
Before Nixon spoke on Tuesday, activists issued statements dismissing his plans. “We have proven we can peacefully assemble and function at a protest, can the police say the same?” community organizer Damon Davis said in a statement.
The Don’t Shoot Coalition, which is made up of about 50 groups formed after Brown’s shooting, last week vowed to promote a peaceful response while also calling on police to give protesters enough space.

Devendra Fadnavis govt in Maharashtra to seek trust vote todayLetters to  the editor
The 13-day-old BJP government headed by Devendra Fadnavis today won the confidence motion in Maharashtra Assembly by a voice vote, amid protests by former ally Shiv Sena.
As the motion seeking vote of confidence in the BJP government moved by MLA Ashish Shelar was passed in the House where the ruling party is in minority, Shiv Sena MLAs stormed the Well seeking division of votes.
“The motion has been passed,” Speaker Haribhau Bagade announced in the din.
Agitated members of Shiv Sena, which had earlier said that it will oppose the trust vote and and had demanded that its leader Eknath Shinde be accorded the status of Leader of Opposition, shouted slogans.
The Speaker later also announced appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.
Earlier in the day, Bagde was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly after Congress and Shiv Sena withdrew their candidates from the race.
The Speaker had said he would take up the issue of Sena’s demand for LoP’s post after the trust vote as Congress had also staked claim and he would have to study the legal implications. Congress had demanded LoP’s post on the ground that Sena continued to be a constituent of BJP-led NDA.
After Sena members objected to the passing of the trust motion by a voice vote and sought division, Bagde adjourned the House.
When proceedings resumed, the Speaker announced appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.

Modi not invited to Nehru event  BJP furiousLetters to  the editor
Congress’ decision not to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to an international conference to mark Jawaharlal Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary reflects the party’s narrow-mindedness and is a disrespect to the nation, the government and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said today.
“I think they (Congress) are very narrow minded. There is no politics in being narrow minded. Politics means it should include everybody,” Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptullah told reporters on the sidelines of an event.
“Modi is so large-hearted that he is supporting Nehru’s birth anniversary (celebrations) despite the change of government. He is continuing to do that.
“From November 14-19, a lot of programmes are taking place. See how large-hearted the Prime Minister is and how narrow minded is the Congress,” Heptullah said.
Congress has not invited Modi to an international conference it is organising to mark the first Prime Minister’s 125th birth anniversary with party spokesperson Anand Sharma saying, “We have not given any invitation to the Prime Minister. We have invited all those who truly believe in democracy and the ideals of Nehru.”
Taking an exception to the move not to invite Modi, BJP said that Congress should not forget that he is the Prime Minister of the country and not of any party. By not inviting the Prime Minister, they are disrespecting the nation, BJP said.
“When Congress disrespects the Prime Minister, it should realise that it is in fact disrespecting the nation,” said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra.
He added that Congress should stop feeling that one is trying to appropriate their heroes and should stop playing politics on the issue.
Congress has accused Modi of trying to appropriate leaders of the freedom movement like Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Nehru by launching special schemes and diverting attention from their legacy.
“Can the heroes of yesteryears be stolen by anyone? No one is stealing their heroes. Congress should stop playing politics over people who contributed to the upliftment of this country,” Patra said.

AMU row:  Girls will attract more boys to libraryThe Aligarh Muslim University was yesterday at the centre of a raging controversy over not giving access to women undergraduates to the main library in the campus, evoking sharp criticism even as Government sought explanation over the “insult to daughters”.
The AMU cited space constraints and refuted the charge of having a “sexist approach”.
Taking serious note of it, Human Resource Ministry asked explanation from the AMU Vice Chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah with Minister Smriti Irani asserting that education and constitution rights were same for all.
“…there are some reports which hurt you as a woman and also agitates you that when we attained freedom there was a belief that education and constitution rights were same for all….and now we get reports that amounts to insult to daughters,” Irani said on the sidelines of a function in Delhi.
The Vice Chancellor’s remarks that allowing female undergraduates will attract “four times more boys” to the library, added fuel to the fire.
Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptullah termed the Vice Chancellor’s remarks as “appalling” and “shocking” while the new MoS in the Ministry Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said such remarks were “not acceptable in a civilised society”.
Terming Shah’s statement as “regressive and antediluvian”, National Commission for Women chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam wondered
“Is it legal for them (AMU) to bar any student regardless of gender from acessing such services in a university?
The Vice Chancellor’s explanation that there was no fresh ban and that undergraduate girl students studying at the off-campus Women’s College do not have access to facilities of the Maulana Azad Library since it was established in 1960 found few takers.
He said there over 4,000 female undergraduates and the library cannot accomodate them due to space constraints. “There will be no place even to stand (if this is allowed)” he said.
Shah noted that all postgraduate girls and women research scholars “have been enjoying round the clock access to the Maulana Azad Library since its inception” and rejected allegations of gender bias, terming them “not only erroneous but mischievous and defamatory”.

Wary of fallout  Narendra Modi govt may delay call on changes in land lawNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Worried about the adverse political fallout of watering down provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the NDA government is unable to decide whether to go ahead with its plan to amend the Act in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament or try and build a larger consensus on the issue.
Sources said the government is even toying with the idea of taking the ordinance route after the winter session of Parliament to effect key but politically-sensitive changes to the Act. In fact, the government had earlier also mulled issuing an ordinance to give effect to the changes but the move did not fructify.
One reason for the unease within some quarters of the government are two crucial amendments that the Finance Ministry and some key infrastructure ministries want in the law, which may not be acceptable to the opposition Congress and some other parties.  In fact, sources in the Congress say the party has already reached out to other opposition parties to evolve consensus against the move to dilute the law.
These amendments pertain to completely doing away with or drastically watering down the social impact assessment (SIA) clause in the current Act, confining it to large projects/PPP projects.
While one view that has emerged during discussions is that social impact assessment should not be applicable for these types of projects as it causes huge delays in land acquisition, there are others who are opposed to any move to do away with this clause. Under the current Act, social impact assessment is mandatory and it has to be completed within six months.
The second sticking point is expanding the list of projects which are exempted under the Act by including infrastructure and defence projects.
According to sources, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and former Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari had also drafted some other changes to the Act.
Sources say the proposed amendments include doing away with the consent clause completely or keeping it to the minimal.
Currently, prior consent is required from 70 per cent of the affected families if land is being acquired for PPP projects and from 80 per cent in case of private companies.
Sources say there is a strong view that the ‘Retrospective Clause’ — that stipulates that land acquisition proceedings would lapse if compensation is not paid or physical possession not taken — should also be amended in a way so as to render it redundant and make it ineffective. Essentially, under the current Act, this clause applies to any acquisition where no awards have been made or where awards have been made five years or more before the commencement of the new Act but no compensation has been paid or possession has not been taken.
There is a suggestion that a “saving clause” should be introduced in the Act to achieve the purpose.
Some ministries also want restricting the Rehabilitation and Resettlement clause, by narrowing the scope as well as doing away with the requirement that makes the possession of land contingent upon the provision of the promised R&R. The Rural Development Ministry, in its suggestions to the Prime Minister’s Office in July, had proposed to “re-examine” the “elaborate” definition of affected families, which also includes livelihood losers working in the affected area for three years.

Nano scientist to value-for-money tablet maker  now on SoftBanks radarEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Swipe Technologies founder & CEO Shripal Gandhi will be boarding a flight to Tokyo on an invitation from a prospective investor, SoftBank, later this month.
Swipe is one of the three companies to be invited to Tokyo for negotiations after 15 companies met SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son during his visit to India recently. All of them had three minutes to make their pitch. And Gandhi’s Swipe made the cut. Gandhi is not talking on this or willing to offer any other comment. But then, why SoftBank would have got interested in his two-year-old company is not hard to see.
Swipe is succeeding where many have tried and failed — to become a volume leader in tablet PCs. Swipe is the only start-up in devices category focused on tablet PCs with 80% of its revenues coming from tablets. Around 85% of the Swipe portfolio is tablets.
The humble Akash tablet may have failed but it was the spark that triggered the nanotechnology scientist, his return to India from US and venture into this very space. Within two years, the Ichalkaranji, Kolhapu-born and brought up, UDCT, Mumbai, engineer with a degree from University of California in nanotechnology, Gandhi is now heading the tablet PC business with volumes growing at three digits.
Year one to two growth was 150% and this year ramp rate will be between 250% and 300% and a market share of 10% and 12%. Many of the customers are first time buyers in tier 2 and tier 3 cities who are picking tablet PCs instead of desktop PCs which is driving growth.
Swipe has the biggest portfolio of tablets — 32 — in the market including 27 unique ones such as the first 3D tablet to exclusive tablet for kids who want to chew on it while playing. Many of the Swipe products are attractively priced almost at one third the price of what competition offers with similar features.
Lessons learnt during stints with Motorola, Samsung and Apple in the US as a technology scientist filing patents ensured that Gandhi’s Swipe was not a ‘Me Too’ product and scored high on innovation and understanding on what the Indian customer wants. Swipe’s munition were disruptive technology, disruptive concept and disruptive price. The 3D tablet has sold one lakh units and is priced at Rs 3,999.
Similarly, to grow the brand, Swipe tied up with brands such as MTV for co-branded devices which has worked. Gandhi is a specialist in touchscreen technology and his experience with the complex structure for designing and developing as well as the global supply chain of the tablet ecosystem such as chipset makers, printed circuit boards and people into integration has ensured that the company is able to have a firm handle on costs. It is these cost savings that it is able to pass on to the customers and price the devices attractively.
The Swipe team has grown from four in July 2012 to 140 and a team dominated by product developers with an understanding of product development. Swipe first went into markets such as Rajasthan, Punjab and J&K and not the big metro markets so it has clear leadership in these markets. This was followed by entry into the West and South. Soon, Swipe will be going to Africa and West Asia. Swipe received Series A funding from Kalaari Capital of R30 crore in April 2014.
After demonstrating what it can do in the consumer space and building critical scale with revenues of R150 crore and above, the company is now leveraging these resources, reach and expertise to break into the enterprise segment and the education space. Swipe will foray into the education space with a platform that will have content curated by Swipe for class I to X across all boards in India. Around 70,000 such tablets are already available in the market and will go up to 2 lakh devices by March 2015.

eBay India MD Latif Nathani meets Nirmala Sitharaman  says not seeking FDINarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
eBay India managing director Latif Nathani on Tuesday called on commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Nathani, however, said he did not discuss foreign direct investment (FDI) in e-commerce.
He said that eBay is a great platform that Indian products can use to gain global exposure as it has over 150 million buyers across 200-plus countries. eBay India is a fully local company and pays taxes in India, he said, adding that it was not seeking any FDI.
In August, Sitharaman had said at the Indian Express Group’s Idea Exchange that “FDI is banned in the multi-brand retail and the same applies to e-commerce also”.
The minister’s clarification came at a time when authorities suspect that many e-commerce firms have structured their business in such a way that foreign capital coming to their wholesale business indirectly supports the retail e-commerce business. Recent reports said some of the leading e-commerce companies are being probed by the Enforcement Directorate for alleged violations of foreign exchange regulations.
FE had reported that several e-commerce firms that operate in the B2C (business-to-consumer) space but whose affiliates in the B2B space have foreign direct investment are likely to be in trouble going by Sitharaman’s statement.
India permits 100% FDI in B2B e-commerce activities (as in wholesale trade) but foreign investment is not allowed in B2C e-commerce companies. But some foreign firms are present in the country through what is called the marketplace model. Under this model, they do not retail any products but offers a platform for consumers to place orders, which are then retailed by domestic retailers. This is perfectly legal.
However, there are some domestic B2C e-commerce companies that also operate through the marketplace model but allegedly use their other FDI-funded ventures in the B2B space for retail sales. The minister’s reiteration of the policy would mean that such companies could face the music.
On Tuesday, commerce and industry ministry officials said in the second Services Conclave, a two-day event beginning Wednesday in the national capital, and an international services exhibition that will be held later this month, will see discussions on e-commerce and ways to make India an e-commerce giant.
“We are hoping to get suggestions on reforms in the regulations on e-commerce and we will consider implementing them as e-commerce is an important area for the country,” an official said.

Pope sets up commission to deal with sex abuse appealsPope has set up a new commission to handle appeals by priests who have been disciplined for sexual abuse of minors.
By: Reuters | Vatican City | Posted: November 12, 2014 2:45 am
Pope Francis has set up a new commission to handle appeals by priests who have been disciplined for sexual abuse of minors, the Vatican said on Tuesday.
A Vatican spokesman said the commission, a new part of the Vatican’s doctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, would be made up of seven bishops or cardinals and had been set up to deal with a backlog of appeals.
He said Vatican was receiving four or five appeals a month in cases of “delicta graviora,” the Vatican terminology for offences including sexual abuse of minors by clergy.
Under the changes, the new commission would handle appeals while an existing office in the doctrinal department would continue to handle initial cases.
The Vatican said earlier this year that between 2004 and 2013, it had defrocked about 850 priests who had been accused of sexual abuse of minors.

Factbox: Ebola cases in the United StatesNine cases of Ebola have been seen in the United States since the beginning of August.
By: Reuters | Washington | Posted: November 12, 2014 2:38 am
Nine cases of Ebola have been seen in the United States since the beginning of August. No one in the United States is currently being treated for the disease. Only one person has died in the United States of Ebola, a Liberian man who was treated at a hospital in Dallas, Texas.
The following are details of cases of the hemorrhagic fever seen in the United States:
NEW YORK DOCTOR
Dr Craig Spencer, 33, returned to the United States on October 17 via Belgium after working for Doctors Without Borders charity in Guinea. He tested positive for Ebola on October 23 and was released from the hospital on November 11. His fiancée and two friends are under quarantine until November 14.
NURSES
Nina Pham, 26, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where she helped treat Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan. She was diagnosed four days after Duncan died. On October 24 officials declared Pham free of the virus and she is released from the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, where she had been treated since October 16.
A second nurse at the same hospital who treated Duncan, 29-year-old Amber Vinson, also tested positive for the virus. She was released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on October 28.
Vinson flew from Ohio to Dallas the day before reporting symptoms, raising concerns about possible spread of the disease, which someone can get through contact with bodily fluids. Ohio has not reported any case of Ebola.
NBC CAMERAMAN
Ashoka Mukpo, an American freelance television cameraman working for NBC News in Liberia, was flown out of the country  for treatment at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.
Mukpo, 33, was declared free of the virus on October 21 and left the hospital the next day. “Recovering from Ebola is a truly humbling feeling. Too many are not as fortunate and lucky as I’ve been. I’m very happy to be alive,” he said in a Twitter post this week.
The NBC crew who worked with Mukpo also returned to the United States and were ordered into quarantine after violating their voluntary confinement.
LIBERIAN IN DALLAS
Duncan was visiting Dallas when he began feeling ill and sought treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25. He was initially discharged with antibiotics, despite telling a nurse he had just come from Liberia. On September 28 he returned to the same hospital by ambulance after vomiting outside the apartment complex where he was staying. Duncan died in an isolation ward 11 days later.
EMORY PATIENT
An unidentified American who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone began treatment at Emory University Hospital on September 9. The patient, who has asked to remain anonymous, was discharged on October 19, the university said.

GST dream one step closer to reality; empowered panel of state FMs & Centre agree on 'place of supply' rules
Deepshikha Sikarwar, ET Bureau Nov 12, 2014, 08.56AM IST

Arun Jaitley
(Prime Minister Narendra…)
NEW DELHI: The government's bid to implement the goods & services tax (GST) as early as possible got a significant boost with the empowered committee of state finance ministers endorsing the so-called 'place of supply' rules that form the backbone of the new regime that will replace a plethora of levies, create a common market and likely give GDP growth a lift of up to two percentage points. The states are also confident GST will be in place by April 1, 2016, six years after it was originally scheduled to take effect.
The place of supply rules decide where goods or services will be taxed, fixing a crucial element of the levy that has gained in importance because of the surge in ecommerce and electronic delivery of services. Meanwhile, the Centre is preparing the ground for a national common market commission that will mesh with GST to create a unified area without interstate barriers to trade. However, both the Centre and the states continue to differ on the threshold for the levy with the first wanting it to be raised to Rs 25 lakh while the latter prefers it at Rs 10 lakh.
The Centre has assured the states that they won't suffer any revenue loss on account of subsuming petroleum product and entry taxes within the ambit of GST, promising to meet an important concern of states that are opposed to these duties being included in the levy that was to have been rolled out in April 2010.
"The empowered committee has given in-principle clearance to place of supply rules... This is a key takeaway from today's meeting," a senior government official, aware of the panel's deliberations on Tuesday, told ET.
Tax experts see finalisation of these rules as key to GST. "Place of supply rules are fundamental in determining the state where a service is provided and state GST or integrated GST is required to be paid," said Bipin Sapra, partner, EY. "These are extremely crucial to the basic structure of GST." Place of supply and consumption will determine the tax-recipient state and consuming state and have implications for their revenue.
"Place of supply rules are very critical for GST to run effectively. This is more so in the context of services as determining the state of consumption would be challenging, particularly where the services are not provided from an identified fixed place, such as telecom and transportation," said Pratik Jain, partner, KPMG in India. Jain pointed out that most of the disputes on value added tax in the European Union centre around place of supply rules.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has identified GST as one of the most important items on the government's crowded reforms agenda and progress on the talks is being closely monitored.
The government is expected to finalise the draft of the constitutional amendment Bill that will allow the Centre to tax goods at retail level and states to tax services in a few days. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has already indicated the Centre is in the last stage of finalising the Bill draft, approval of which is an essential step in the process. "If all goes well and the constitutional amendment Bill is carried in Parliament by both Houses, I think the 2016 target date is achievable," said GST Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather.
The empowered panel did not agree to the Centre's demand for a higher threshold for taxing goods and services.
"In September, the Centre wrote to us suggesting that this decision of the empowered committee should be reviewed. The Centre suggested that the limit should beRs25 lakh. Even if it is not Rs25 lakh, the Rs10 lakh limit should be increased," Rather said, adding that the committee wants to stick to the agreed Rs 10 lakh threshold. However, he said the final call on threshold could be taken by the GST Council proposed to be created in the constitution amendment Bill.
GST will subsume central indirect taxes such as excise duty and service tax at the central level and value added tax at the state level besides other local levies such as octroi and entry tax. Though states are reluctant to include entry tax within GST, the Centre is now attempting to persuade them by offering a revenue compensation mechanism. The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, has lapsed and the government has to come up with fresh legislation.

Prabhu s path breaking ideas for Railways | Toilet photos must to end bogus claimsboard member
(“The Rail Land Development…)
NEW DELHI: Railway minister Suresh Prabhu has some path breaking ideas to bring the loss-making retrograde organisation back on track. He has promised new ideas, cutting of red tape, decentralisation and empowering of zonal railways.
Senior railway officials with whom he shared the ideas were impressed but also wary of implementation. Among things that Prabhu talked about are decentralisation of authority from the Railway Board to the zones, incentivising GMs for timely completion of projects and leveraging vast tracts of railway land to raise credit for the cash-strapped organisation. Prabhu was not in favour of privatisation of railway land or leasing it to private builders.
He talked of getting foreign investment into the sector, especially from Japan , which is already funding the Dedicated Freight Corridor (DGC) project of the railways. "All very good and radical ideas but will need a complete change in the way the 161-yearold organisation has been functioning. It will turnaround the railways if the minister can implement them," said a senior railway official .
As per sources, Prabhu is in favour of decentralisation of tendering process to the respective zones. As per the current procedures, most high-value tenders — over `150 crore — come to the Railway Board and are cleared by the minister himself. "He made it clear that he doesn't want time to be wasted in the entire long-winding process and wants GMs to be empowered to handle the tenders at the zonal level. This would also reduce corruption," said the railway official.
However, a railway board member , cynical after over three decades spent in the organization, said that this will only prevent political corruption — the minister will not be able to influence the tendering process. "What about the bureaucrats? Senior railway board members including the Chairman Railway Board will be able to influence the GMs in the tendering process. After all, their ACRs, transfers and postings are taken care of by Rail Bhawan," he said. Moreover, he added, the specifications of the tenders were all issued by the Railway Board, and they were often used to favour some party or the other.
Railway officials said the idea of not privatising railway land or giving it on long-term lease was completely different from what railways have been working on for past decade. "The Rail Land Development Authority was set-up to use the ample railway land as an asset to raise money for the railways. The RLDA had finalised several contracts," said another officer .
"The idea may be good but it will require either scrapping of RLDA or new set of rules to be made. As of the now, the Railway Act does allow for mortgaging of the land. It is a government asset and we do not have the authority to mortgage. RLDA allows us leasing and even outright sale but not mortgaging," he explained. Prabhu refused to comment and said he will talk only after a month when he settles down in the ministry.

A wine festival in hard-drinking DelhiComments
Select wines from across the world, tasting sessions, lectures on global traditions and exhibitions of different types of glassware associated with the premium drink – all this and more will be on display in the Capital early next year with the city government planning to host Delhi’s first-ever wine festival.
The Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) wants to hold the three-day event at south Delhi’s Garden of Five Senses. The government hopes the festival will boost tourism and raise awareness about wine in a city known for its love of hard liquor.
Entry fees would be kept high, said government sources.
“In order to increase the consumption of wine -- which is food-based and natural -- and to wean people away from hard liquor, they have to be educated about the benefits of the drink,” the department has said in its proposal, a copy of which is with HT.
Leading Indian and international wineries will be a part of the fest and officials plan to promote cultural interactions with other countries and attract foreign tourists through the event. Government sources said they are consulting wine connoisseurs to make the event successful.
“Consumers aren’t aware about the quality of wine, the optimum temperature for proper storage of wine and the different types of Indian snacks that go with the drink,” said a Delhi government official. 
Residents also feel the move will help in a city where drinking is considered taboo. “Women still hesitate to go to liquor stores. The festival will help educate people and let them enjoy different varieties of wine,” said Namrata Dubey, a resident of south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar.

In: snack-ish meals eaten at home.
Out: meals eaten at restaurants.
American consumers are putting together more meals at home -- though not necessarily cooked meals -- and eating fewer meals out, according to an a new study by the research firm NPD Group.   This makes for one of the biggest changes in eating patterns of Americans over the past five years, concludes the comprehensive study of more than 7,000 consumers, the 29th Annual Eating Patterns in America Report.
Americans bought just 191 restaurant meals per person over the year ending Aug., 2014,  vs. 215 meals per person in the year 2000, when eating out was at a peak.
"We are eating more meals at home -- but not cooking more meals," says Harry Balzer, vice president at NPD Group, in a phone interview.  "We are taking snacks and making them meals."
Among the most popular snacks: yogurt, sandwiches, cereal bars and fruit.   In a tough economic environment, that's rapidly evolving into the new American meal, says Balzer.
"The real foods and beverages of the decade are not hummus, quinoa, nor kale, and not even Sriracha," says Balzer.   Rather, he says, its snack foods or simple foods that require little to no preparation.
Among the more popular lunches, he says: a fruit cup, cheese stick and yogurt.
In the process, we're now eating about eight in 10  meals at home, he says.  "Restaurants are an expensive proposition when incomes are an issue," he says. "The only thing that benefits restaurants is population growth."
The restaurant industry is certainly paying attention to this trend, but says it's not as bad as the NPD study makes it sound, says an official from the National Restaurant Association.
"Although the economy remains somewhat modest, consumer mindset is improving and restaurant sales continue to advance," says Hudson Riehle senior vice president of research & knowledge.  Eating and drinking places are among the sectors posting the strongest gains in recent months, he says.   The typical Americans orders restaurant meals five to seven times weekly, accounting for 47%of the food dollar, he says.
But less-so among Millennials, the industry's most crucial sector, says  Balzer.
Millennials (18 to 34) ordered just 200 meals from restaurants over the year ending Aug. 2014. vs. 250 meals in 2007.   "The recession really hurt them more than just about anyone in their use of restaurants," says Balzer.
The fast-food restaurant of choice for Millennials:  the convenience store, says Balzer.
So, it's not as if we're cooking more.  "We're still leaving the cooking to others," says Balzer.  "With restaurant visits down, the manufacturers of our foods are filling more of that need."

Major whose wife complained against senior officer gets a rapChandigarh | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:52 am
By Man Aman Singh Chhina
The Army has served a warning to a Major posted in an artillery regiment in Faridkot after his wife complained that the local brigade commander “forced her to participate in rehearsals for a fashion show being organised as part of family welfare activities”. The Major has been accused of “using” his wife to file the complaint “for his own grievances”.
Vidhya A Karajagi, wife of Major Anappa C Karajagi, had complained to Lt Gen A K Sahni, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of South Western Command in July, that she was being forced by Brigadier Sanjiv Yadav, Commander of 16 Artillery Brigade, to take part in rehearsals for a fashion show.
In her complaint, the Major’s wife had alleged that she was harassed for objecting to the fashion show rehearsals in the presence of her husband and his Commanding Officer, Col Rajeev Dhawan
Reacting to the complaint, the Army had instituted a one-man inquiry, conducted by a Brigadier, in August.
While the Major’s wife is yet to hear the outcome of the inquiry, her husband was summoned by the GOC of the Division on October 12 and served with a warning order.
The order charges the Major for having used his wife to file a complaint with the Army authorities whereas it was he who should have done so and warned him not to repeat the mistake.

Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 12:  
Hours before Devendra Fadnavis Government faces trust vote, the Shiv Sena today said it will vote against it in the Maharashtra Assembly.
“Shiv Sena has decided to sit in Opposition. We will vote against the trust vote,” senior Sena leader Ramdas Kadam told reporters at Vidhan Bhawan here.
“We have lost faith in them (BJP),” Kadam said.
After Sena President Uddhav Thackeray addressed a meeting of party legislators here last night, Sena sources had said he will announce the party’s stand on trust vote today.
Meanwhile, the BJP said the decision of Sena, with which it had an alliance for 25 years in Maharashtra, was not in the state’s interest.
“The Sena’s decision is against the interests of Maharashtra,” state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said.

Downward slide: Petrol  diesel prices to be cut again | Crude prices nearing bottomYou are here: Home > Collections > Litre
IOC, BPCL, HPCL to go for round III of fuel price cuts, reduction likely on November 15

NEW DELHI: State oil firms plan to cut petrol rates for the seventh time since June and diesel for the third time since the fuel was decontrolled on October 18 as Indian consumers gain from the sharp fall in global oil prices before polls in Jharkhand and Jammu & Kashmir.
Industry experts said according to current trend Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd ( BPCL ) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd ( HPCL ) are likely to reduce pump price of petrol and diesel by about Rs 1 per litre by the end of this week. For consumers, the two fuels are already 10%-13% cheaper than their peak earlier in the year.
Fuel prices are reviewed and aligned with global trends in the beginning and middle of every month. Prices are likely to be cut on Nov 15, barely 10 days before assembly elections begin in two states.
The cuts could be steeper depending on further slide in international prices of auto fuels in next four days, official sources said. The government has allowed state fuel retailers to align pump prices of petrol and diesel with international market. Benchmark Brent crude dropped four years low at around $82 per barrel on Tuesday.
"International gasoline and diesel prices have so far dropped by $1-3 per barrel since the last price revision on Oct 31. Prices may drop further by Saturday, when companies will review their retail selling price. Reductions would depend on the 15-days average rates of diesel and gasoline fortnight and the rupee-dollar exchange rate that determines the landed cost of fuel if it is imported," an industry source said.
Last time, oil companies reduced petrol prices by Rs 2.41 per litre and diesel by Rs 2.25 on Oct 31. So far, companies have reduced petrol prices by 13% or Rs 9.36 per litre in six consecutive rate revision. They reduced diesel price by about 10% or Rs 5.62 per litre in just two revision since the fuel price was deregulated on Oct 18. Currently, petrol is sold at Rs 64.24 per litre in Delhi and diesel at Rs 53.35 per litre.
Companies are also expected to marginally reduce revenue losses on cooking gas, where they are losing about Rs 394 per 14.2 kilogram cylinder.
The government deregulated diesel prices last month. Companies also enjoys petrol pricing freedom since June 2010. But, this freedom is not absolute as companies would require tacit approval of the oil ministry before changing pump prices of petrol and diesel, sources said.
It is likely that the government would not pass the entire pricing benefits to the consumer for political reasons. The international oil market is highly volatile and a cushion is required to absorb pricing shock if rates move north, especially during month-long assembly elections, sources said. The five-phase polling in Jharkhand and J&K would start from November 25 and continue for almost a month. Results for the two assembly elections would be declared on December 29.

Rakhi in AAP first list  Kejriwal for New Delhi againRakhi in AAP first list, Kejriwal for New Delhi again
Darpan Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 12, 2014
First Published: 00:45 IST(12/11/2014) | Last Updated: 15:12 IST(13/11/2014)
Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and seven other erstwhile AAP ministers will figure in the Aam Aadmi Party’s first list of nearly 35 candidates for the upcoming assembly polls, likely to be released  in a couple of days. 
Rakhi birla
No candidate is expected to change their seat with Kejriwal seeking re-election from the New Delhi constituency, where he won a famous victory last year, defeating then CM Sheila Dikshit by over 25,000 votes. Of the seven party candidates in the Lok Sabha polls, only Rakhi Birla is set to make the list.
As reported by HT on Sunday, the party has decided to drop six sitting MLAs over concerns of poor performance. About 30 other candidates who finished a poor third or fourth in the last assembly elections are also unlikely to get tickets.
The novice party is fighting a resurgent BJP that is banking on PM Narendra Modi’s personal charm to win a majority in the 70-member house in polls likely early next year.
Despite winning 28 seats in a stunning debut in the 2013 assembly elections, the AAP government resigned within 49 days, saying they didn’t have the numbers to pass key legislation.  The party has since seen a reversal of fortune, drawing a blank in the Capital in May’s general elections.
Party leaders Ashutosh and Ashish Khetan – both of whom fought the general elections – are busy with organizational work while Rajmohan Gandhi’s stature is too big to fight an assembly poll, the AAP said.
“Barring Gandhi, all six LS candidates are in contention for assembly poll tickets. They are well known and--despite defeats--got a lot of votes, pushing Congress candidates to the third slot,” said a senior party leader.
Like the 2013 elections, the AAP wants to be ahead of both the BJP and the Congress in selecting candidates so that its picks have more time to campaign. “We announced about 50 names a good six months before the elections. This allowed us to complete door-to-door campaigning in as many as 60 of the 70 constituencies,” said the leader. 
The party is also working to finalise the rest of the 35-odd candidates. “Volunteer meetings are happening in the presence of our observers. We will decide on names that are emerging from these meetings,” he said.

Department store Dillard's has stopped selling a controversial holiday sign that appeared in the girls' section of one of its stores in Florida.
The sign read: "Dear Santa, This year please give me a big fat bank account and a slim body. Please don't mix those two up like you did last year. Thanks."
Instagram | @jerzeegrrrl
#Dillards has this sign in their little girl's department. #ListenupDillards this is a horrid message to send to any child! This needs to be removed.
The sign was supposed to be part of the home merchandise area with other "whimsical" signs, said Dillard's spokeswoman Julie Johnson Bull.
"We immediately removed it from the little girls' display," she said, adding that the sign would also no longer be sold in any of the chain's 298 stores.
As first reported by WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach, Fla., a photo of the sign was initially posted to social media by a mother of three.
"I was appalled by a sign in the little girls department," wrote Julie Khanna on her Facebook post , which was shared 377 times. She added, "This is NOT the message we should be sending our girls!!"
Bull would not comment on whether the sign sent a negative message to adults as well. She said the company's decision to remove the sign from all stores was in direct response to the social media comments.

Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
BSE Sensex and Nifty rose to record highs today, amid buying in rate-sensitive stocks ahead of the inflation data later in the day.
The Nifty rose above 8400 for the first time, after rising nearly 40 points. It rose to a new high of 8,415. The Sensex gained nearly 200 points to rise to a new high of 28,126.48.
Traders are eyeing industrial production and inflation data to be released after market hours today. According to estimates, IIP rose a modest 0.8 per cent in September while consumer inflation in October fell to 5.67 per cent.
Indian markets have set a series of new highs since the third week of October, aided by strong foreign inflows and government's reform measures.
Foreign institutional investors have pumped in close to Rs 10,213 crore since October 20.
Bank stocks led the gains amid expectations that the RBI could cut rates earlier than expected. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC rose 1 per cent. Another rate-sensitive sector auto also saw buying action. Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp were up over 2 per cent.
Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India Research at UBS Securities, said buying from domestic investors is keeping the market supported. Equity mutual funds saw sixth straight month of inflows in October. This takes the six-month total to Rs 39,000 crore, the largest ever for a six-month period.
Indian markets gave up some gains in afternoon trade. At 2:31 pm, the Sensex was up 71 points while Nifty rose 9 points to 8,372.

Cong has created lot of black money: BJPLetters to  the editor
BJP today accused Congress leaders of generating black money in the country while referring to the matter of the alleged tax evasion by its spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi and asked Congress President Sonia Gandhi to clarify on the issue.
“The issue of Singhvi is just a sample as it is only what has come out in the public domain. How many Congress leaders are turning black money into white?
“Congress has created a lot of black money during the last 10 years of its government, which saw a lot of corruption and scams. Congress President Sonia Gandhi should clarify,” said BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma.
Terming the matter “a classic case of tax evasion”, BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “This is a classic case of how black money is produced within the country by the tall leaders of Congress.”
Attacking the Congress, he said, “It sermonises on black money and this is what is happening in its own house. You are producing black money in your own house and are evading taxes. The Congress has a lot to answer for.
“Either you (Congress) own up that your tall leaders are evading taxes and indulging in generation of black money or you disown Singhvi.”
Sharma accused the Congress of being the “fountainhead of corruption” and said this is the reason why its MPs did not give an undertaking on black money in Parliament whereas all the BJP legislators had done so.
“This is only the tip of the iceberg. The country is well aware of the fact that many tall leaders of Congress have stashed black money not only abroad but also at home. Law will surely take its course but will Congress punish Singhvi?” Patra said.
Citing details of revelations by the Income Tax Settlement Commission, Patra said there has been a substantial increase in Singhvi’s income and, in a short span of time between Jan. 15, 2011, to March 31, 2011, there was a considerable jump in payments for his legal assistance.
“In this short span of about two-and-a-half months, about 18,199 vouchers were signed by Singhvi. On a single day, March 31, 2011, about 1,207 vouchers were signed. All these are self -made vouchers. No authentic bills were procured,” Patra said.

Cost overruns of Rs 1.90 lakh cr  delays in 83% infra projects  Plan panel tells PMNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Highlighting the plight of the country’s infrastructure sector, the Planning Commission has told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that 83 per cent of over 700 central sector projects have sustained cost overruns of nearly Rs 1,90,000 crore and delays of up to 12 years.
In a telling commentary of the infrastructure projects, the commission in a presentation to Modi last week said investments of Rs 5.6 lakh crore have already been made on 707 central sector projects including roads, railways, airports, ports, telecom and power sectors, but another Rs 5.7 lakh crore is required to ensure their completion. Of these 707 projects, the Railways incurred the biggest delays, with 274 of its projects missing completion targets. Of these 274 projects, 236 have no date of commissioning, including the coal evacuation projects in Jharkhand.
Railways is followed by the road sector as 118 of its projects are delayed, with 26 having no date of commissioning. The Road Transport and Highways Ministry has been able to toll only 435 km of highways in 2013-14 against a target of 2,148 km. The ministry along with National Highways Authority of India has completed construction of 1,984 km out of targeted 6,300 km, according to the presentation that was made on November 5.
According to the plan panel, the projects are delayed due to a variety of reasons including delay in land acquisition, relief and rehabilitation issues, environment and forest norms and adverse law and order situation in some cases.
Similarly, in the ports and inland waterways sector, the government had set a target for bidding out 26 ports but the Shipping Ministry has managed to bid out only half of the number. While enhancing tonnage capacity to 218 million tonne is targeted in 2014-15, a capacity of 50.97 MT has been achieved so far.
Most importantly, although an investment target of Rs 22,536 crore has been set for the Shipping Ministry, the sector has witnessed an investment of Rs 6,893.04 crore from April to October this year, according to the presentation.
In the power sector too, the government has been able to ensure electricity generation of 11,715 MW against a target of 20,882 MW during the April-October period. According to the presentation, electricity has been provided to 181 towns against a target of 350 towns. In coal production, the state-run Coal India has achieved an output of 313.97 million tonne during the April-October period against a target of 630.25 MT for 2014-15, while coal imports to the tune of 50 MT took place against target of 94 MT.

(Cognizant CEO, Francisco…)
NEW DELHI: In yet another acquisition, Cognizant on Wednesday said that it will acquire Odecee, a provider of digital solutions to enterprises in Australia and New Zealand region. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Significantly, this is the second acquisition made by Cognizant in the digital space, after Cognizant last month bought Cadient Group, a digital marketing agency.
Founded in 2007, Odecee delivers enterprise mobility, web and cloud solutions to clients in the financial services, insurance, healthcare, logistics, and communications industries. "This acquisition further strengthens Cognizant's digital business transformation expertise and expands its portfolio of tools and services to help clients create digital enterprises that capitalize on new business models, drive innovative products and services, enhance workforce productivity, and improve customer experience," Cognizant's press statement said.
As part of this acquisition, approximately 150 digital specialists with expertise across enterprise mobile, web and cloud services will join Cognizant. "This acquisition also brings to Cognizant intellectual property such as Velocedee, a platform that helps centralize highly secure mobile applications and enables rapid implementation of core business processes across a wide range of mobile devices," the statement added.
John Burgin , Regional Head for Australia and New Zealand, Cognizant said, "This strategic acquisition underscores our commitment to the local market and our focus on strengthening our digital capabilities."
"Rapid consumerization of technology is driving business reinvention across industries and blurring the distinction between the physical and the digital worlds. As businesses become increasingly technology-intensive and physical processes get instrumented and digitized, our strong portfolio of services, coupled with our aggressive investments in SMAC (social, mobile, analytics and cloud) technologies, will help clients drive meaningful change and build ever more connected, collaborative, and real-time businesses. We welcome Odecee's talented professionals to Cognizant and look forward to leveraging our combined strengths to empower clients to address the needs of the digital era," Burgin added.
Commenting on the acquisition, Con Mouzouris, Co-founder and Managing Director of Odecee said, "This is a strategic step forward for us and opens up a significant growth opportunity for us across newer technologies and industries."
Cognizant, like its rivals in the IT space, is aggressively beefing up its presence in the digital and social, mobility, analytics and cloud space or Smac, as customers across industries are asking IT vendors to keep costs down and at the same time bring more efficiency. This has led to most companies increase their headcount in these areas or buy some of the smaller firms focused in these areas. Cognizant generates northwards of $500 million business from the Smac business. Other IT firms, including TCS and Infosys does not for now given an individual break-up of business generated from some of these newer areas.

Aurobindo Pharma to buy US-based Natrol for ...Aurobindo Pharma emerges top bidder to buy Natrol Inc for $132.5 million

(Generic drugmaker Aurobindo…)
HYDERABAD: Hyderabad headquartered drug maker Aurobindo Pharma has Wednesday announced emerging as the highest bidder to buy the US-based nutritional supplement maker Natrol Inc, owned by the Indian pharmaceutical firm Plethico Pharmaceuticals, for around $132.5 million (approximately Rs 810 crore).
The nutritional supplement maker, bought by Plethico Pharma in 2008 for about $82 million, had filed a bankruptcy application in June this year in the wake of class actions in the North American market. The process of acquisition is based on an auction and with an agreement to take on certain liabilities of the US firm.
Markets cheered the development and Aurobindo Pharma scrip on BSE rose 2.13% at Rs 580 at around 3pm, while the exchange's benchmark Sensex gained over 100 points at 28,010 points.
Aurobindo Pharma finds Natrol, which has some $500 million of assets and some $100 million of liabilities, has a strategic fit for the company. "Natrol is an excellent strategic fit and provides the right platform for creating a fully integrated OTC platform in the USA and in other international markets," Aurobindo said in a statement.
The Hyderabad drug maker views that the US firm could bring in strong brand reputation and presence in a variety of attractive supplements markets, apart from proven performance in the mass market, health food and speciality channels. Aurobindo also views that Natrol buy will help it benefit from the existing long term relationships of the US nutritional supplement maker with key distribution and retail partners addressing a broad range of consumers.
Aurobindo said the transaction was subject to final approval by the US court and other statutory approvals as may be required and other conditions as per the asset purchase agreement. The US bankruptcy court for the district of Delaware has to approve the process the acquisition.
While Barclays acted as the sole financial advisor, Sullivon and Cromwell LLP offered services as the legal counsel to Aurobindo.
Angel Broking's pharma analyst Sarabjit Kour Nangra said, "On the valuation front, given that the Natrol has been reported to have an overall debt of US $69mn, the company has been acquired at around 2xEV/sales, which is reasonable. On the funding part, the company can easily fund the same, as the company has comfortable debt: equity of 1:1".

(Low prices may induce countries…)
The demand-supply equation, which was pushing global crude oil prices higher in the first half of 2014, has gone awry, with Saudi Arabia aggressively expanding output in a bid to maintain market share rather than cutting it to support prices as it had done for many years. Saudi Arabia's aggressive stance stems from its bad experience in late 80s, when its production cuts to support oil prices helped other countries — including its Opec colleagues — make a killing, while it suffered 16 years of budget deficits.
Thus, it's safe to assume that Saudi Arabia, as well as Opec, are unlikely to cut output in the near future. On the other hand, low prices may induce countries which are largely dependent on oil revenues, to increase production to the extent possible to balance their internal budgets. The most severe impact of low oil prices will be on unconventional oil producers, such as shale oil in the US and tar sands in Canada due to their high cost of production.
According to International Energy Agency , more than 20% of global crude output in 2013 was unconventional, which is expected to reach 33% by 2035. According to various estimates, about a third of the US daily shale oil production of 6.5 million barrel turns uneconomical if the oil price is below $80 a barrel. The price level is regarded as the bottom for Brent, the international oil maker. A recent Goldman Sachs report forecasts Brent hitting a floor of $80 a barrel in the second quarter of 2015, then rising to $90 in 2016 as US shale oil production slows down.

Nikkei @ new 7-year high on tax-relief hopesasian markets
(Equity markets in Asia moved…)
TOKYO: Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Equity markets in the rest of Asia moved little after a flat close in a holiday-thinned Wall Street session, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan off just 0.1 per cent in early trade.
Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8 per cent to hit a fresh seven-year high.
The Sankei newspaper, citing unnamed government and coalition officials, said Abe will delay a planned second sales tax increase by a year and a half and take the issue to voters. Abe on Tuesday said he had yet to decide on the timing of an election.
Abe has said he will make up his mind on the tax increase after assessing the July-September GDP data due next Monday, widely expected to highlight the fragility of the rebound following a sharp contraction in the second quarter.
The first increase in the two-stage sale tax hike in April knocked the Japanese economy hard, and markets view a delay in the second-phase of the tax hike as positive for growth.
A snap election could cement Abe's grip on power because opposition parties are too fragmented to win, despite a decline in the prime minister's approval ratings.
"Short-term players are jumping onto this, although in the long run, this just means a delay in fiscal reform and not necessarily positive," said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
Indeed, Japanese government bond prices fell as a delay in the planned tax hike would heighten doubts on whether Tokyo can achieve its fiscal target to balance the budget outside debt payments by 2020.
  The 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield rose to one-month high of 0.515 per cent, up 3.5 basis points from Tuesday close.
However, given massive bond-buying by the Bank of Japan, investors see limited room for further rises in JGB yields.
The yen, which has remained under pressure for nearly two years due to the BOJ's aggressive stimulus, was on the back foot.
The greenback traded at 115.80 yen, having risen to a seven-year high of 116.11 yen on Tuesday.
The dollar lost a bit of steam against other currencies, as investors took profits from its hefty gains in the last few months.
The euro traded at $1.2477, keeping some distance from a two-year low of $1.2358 hit on Friday.
In the energy market, Brent crude futures in London closed down 67 cents on Tuesday, or 0.8 per cent, at $81.67 a barrel after hitting a four-year low of $81.23. US crude fell 0.7 per cent in Asia on Wednesday.
Some analysts said Brent fared worse on Tuesday because of growing expectations that global producer group OPEC will not cut output.

Hyundai  Kia to triple range of green cars by 2020Hyundai, Kia to triple range of green cars by 2020

SEOUL, Nov 12:  
Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp plan to triple their number of fuel-efficient cars by 2020, addressing concerns about the pair's green track record and competitiveness in fuel economy.
Investors have voiced concern about Hyundai's latest Genesis and Kia's Soul having lower fuel mileage than their predecessors, and about a $350 million fine in the US for overstating vehicles' fuel economy.
The announcement on Wednesday came a week after the pair pledged to raise the fuel economy of their vehicles by 25 per cent by 2020 to meet emissions regulations in the US and Europe and at home in South Korea.
It also followed an announcement on Tuesday that the pair would buy back 670 billion won ($615 million) worth of shares, in what was widely regarded as an attempt to appease investors angered by a $10-billion bid for property for new headquarters.
"Investors have complained about Hyundai's lack of shareholder-friendly policies and communication about its vision, especially after the land deal," said analyst Yim Eun-young of Samsung Securities.
"Today's announcement seems to be part of its efforts to soothe shareholders and better communicate with the market."
Shares of Hyundai have fallen 25 per cent this year, but have risen over 17 per cent since hitting a more than four-year low on November 5. Kia stock has declined 0.9 per cent while the benchmark index has lost 2.4 per cent.
Under Wednesday's plan, Hyundai and Kia will raise their number of fuel-efficient cars to "at least" 22 by 2020 from seven now.
"We have set an internal target of making it to No.2 in the global eco-friendly car market, which is expected to grow from this year's 2.2 million vehicles to 6.4 million in 2020," Hyundai said in a joint statement with Kia.
Hyundai and Kia plan to release 12 models powered by gasoline-electric hybrid engines, expanding the line-up to small cars and sport utility vehicles.
The pair's green range will also have six plug-in hybrid mid-sized and compact cars, two fuel-cell cars and two battery-powered electric cars.

The BSE Sensex on Wednesday closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions. It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points.
It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in Tuesday's trade. A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours on Wednesday, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 per cent), Bajaj Auto (2.10 per cent), HDFC Ltd (1.12 per cent), SBI (0.17 per cent), ICICI Bank (1.33 per cent), HDFC Bank (0.44 per cent), ITC (1.55 per cent), Bharti Airtel (0.64 per cent), BHEL (0.88 per cent), Coal India (0.10 per cent), Dr Reddy's (0.58 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 per cent), Tata Motors (1.71 per cent) and TCS (0.55 per cent).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.

Maoists ask Dalits to launch resistance movement to protest Ahmednagar killingsPrint
Unidentified persons had brutally murdered Sanjay Jagganath Jadhav (42), his wife Jayshree (38) and their only son Sunil (19). (Source: Express archive)
Written by Chandan Shantaram Haygunde | Pune | Posted: November 12, 2014 11:48 am | Updated: November 12, 2014 12:13 pm
The banned Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-M) has issued a press release asking Dalits to form groups for eradication of caste and launch ‘stiff resistance’ to condemn the brutal killings of three persons from a Dalit family in Javkhed Khalsa village in Pathardi taluka of Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra.
The press release issued by Mahatashtra state committee of CPI-Maoists, signed by comrade Sahyadri – who is believed to be Milind Teltumbde, a top CPI-Maoist operative – has compared the Pathardi incident with the Khairlanji Dalit killings. It has asked its people liberation guerrilla army (PLGA), jantana sarkar, revolutionary organisations, Dalits, non-Dalits and intellectuals to condemn and launch a solid protest against the Pathardi killings.
Unidentified persons had brutally murdered and chopped into pieces Sanjay Jagganath Jadhav (42), his wife Jayshree (38) and their only son Sunil (19), in Javkhed Khalsa on October 21. There is not breakthrough yet in this case.
The press release has asked the Dalit population to come out on roads.
CPI-Maoists blame people from the Brahmani Hindu community for such crimes against Dalits. The press release has asked the Dalit population to come out on roads and give a “tit-for-tat” reply for the killings. The press release further says,”The problem of attacks on Dalits would not be solved by giving memorandums and meeting the governor. The only option is that Dalits should show their strength. Maoists would fully support the struggle of Dalits against Brahamani Hindu fascists…. Dalit youths to come together and form Jati Niurmulan Sanghatna all over to put up a stiff resistance against the Hindu fascists.”
The Dandakaranya special zonal committee of CPI-Maoists has also released pamphlets to condemn the Pathardi killings appealing Dalits and non-Dalits to carry out strong protests.
Meanwhile, police believe that Maoists are trying to use the Pathardi killings incident as an opportunity to penetrate into Dalits and prepare them for armed struggle against the government.
Maoists have also released pamphlets to condemn the Pathardi killings.
A section of Dalits agitated recently against the reports in regional media, quoting senior police officers that Maoists allegedly trying to provoke Dalits for taking up arms against the government following the Pathardi killings. Activists claimed such news are planted by police in media to cover up their failure in stopping crime against Dalits.
Even during an agitation of several Dalit organisations in Pune to condemn the Pathardi killings on November 5, Dalit activists raised slogans “Amhi ahot Ambedkarwadi..Amhi nahi naxalwadi (We are Ambedkarites, not naxalites)”.
Special inspector general of police Ravindra Kadam said, “The press release and pamphlet of Maoists make it clear they are provoking the Dalit community for causing violence. It is continued…

Infra to be main focus area for Indo-US com...Barack Obama
("A lot of "good ground work"…)
WASHINGTON: A lot of "good ground work" has been covered, post Obama-Modi meet in the US, and now is the execution time, with infrastructure going to be the focus of the Indo-US commerce ties , a top official has said.
"In the joint statement, one of the big focus areas is infrastructure sector," Arun M Kumar, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the US and Foreign Commercial Service in the US Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, said.
He was referring to the India-US joint statement issued after the September 30 meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Barack Obama .
There is an "enthusiastic" response from the US companies, he noted. Appreciative of the steps being taken by the new Indian government in "improving" the business climate in the country, he said, there were a lot of areas where improvement are required. Land acquisition is one of them, he said.
"We have seen determination (by the new government) to move forward. We definitely want to build the momentum of our interaction with the new Indian Government in the last few months," he said.
The September visit of Modi to the US and his meeting with Obama at the White House, he said, was very successful.
"We are ready to engage," Kumar said. "We are very excited about the infrastructure collaboration," he added.
"I think, we have covered a lot of good ground work. Now it is execution time," he said.
American companies have a lot of good technologies and practices to offer in the infrastructure sector, said Kumar who is now headed for his third trip to India, the last one was along with the New Delhi visit of the Secretary of State John Kerry and the Commerce Secretary, Penny Pritzker.
He was one of the first few top US officials to visited India after the formation of the Modi Government.
The Commerce Department is expected to play a key role in Indo-US ties now that Modi-Obama meeting agreed to take their bilateral business and trade ties to $500 billion from the current $100 billion.
"It is doable and achievable. We have just scratched the surface of our bilateral trade potential," he said in response to a question, adding that this needs a lot of action, simplification of various areas of investment, improvement in ease of doing business.
Kumar said he would like to see the Infrastructure Collaboration Platform, which was announced after Obama-Modi summit, to succeed.
As per the joint agreement, the US Department of Commerce and the Indian Ministry of Finance agreed to establish an Infrastructure Collaboration Platform that will include mechanisms to identify and clarify critical infrastructure needs of India.
It will provide a single Government of India point of contact for coordinating across ministries; and work with US and Indian industry to facilitate a substantial increase in US industry participation in the execution of Indian infrastructure projects in such sectors such as power, water, sanitation, transportation, safety and smart cities.
"We would really like to see some quick wins, some signals to the US companies that things are happening," Kumar said.
"I really feel we need some quick wins to build the momentum" he said.
US companies have expertise in a whole range of areas ranging from ports, roads, power to rail and building smart cities.
During their meeting Modi and Obama agreed that the US would help in development of three smart cities in India - Visakhapatnam, Ajmer and Allahabad.
"We have to understand, what the needs of the cities are and then find right configuration of expertise. Right now we are in the process of connecting with the cities. We would invite them to participate in the NIST Smart Cities challenge," he said adding that in each city the needs would be different.

NEW DELHI: Banking operations like cheque clearances, cash withdrawals and deposits at public sector bank branches across the country were hit today as employee unions went on a nationwide strike to press for a wage revision.
Private sector banks including ICICI and HDFC, however, worked normally.
Services at ATMs of all the banks were normal, barring a few cases where the machines ran out of cash.
Claiming the strike was a success, United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) Convener M V Murali told PTI: "The strike is a clear warning signal to the adamant IBA (Indian Banks' Association) to change its rigid approach and come forward to for a reasonable wage revision."
"This strike has been forced upon us as bank management did not yield to our scaled down demands for a wage hike from 25 per cent to 23 per cent. So, we had to resort to one-day strike and all employees had to forgo one-day salary," he added.
Banks, including the country's largest one SBI, had informed customers about the inconvenience they were likely to face.
"The UFBU has given a notice to IBA calling for nationwide bank strike on November 12 and All-India State Bank Officers' Federation and All-India State Bank of India Staff Federation being a part of UFBU will also participate in the said strike," SBI had said.
The UFBU is the umbrella organisation of nine bank employees and officer unions.
The National Organisation of Bank Workers General Secretary Ashwini Rana said: "Bank employees are still waiting for their achhe din (good day) even after five months of Modi government."
The wage revision of public sector bank employees has been due since November 2012.
This is the second time this year that bank employees had gone on strike demanding wage revision. The staff of public sector banks were on nationwide strike for two days from February 10.
There are 27 public sector banks in the country with a total employee strength of about 8 lakh. There are about 50,000 branches of these banks across the country.

Shiv Sena helps BJP s Bagde become speaker  but will vote against Fadnavis in floor testComments
The Shiv Sena said on Wednesday it would not support the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial trust vote in the Maharashtra assembly, but left a window open by withdrawing its candidate for the speaker's post.
Sena leader Ramdas Kadam told reporters that party chief Uddhav Thackeray had directed legislators to sit in the opposition  and vote against the BJP.
Despite Sena's the Fadnavis government is still expected to sail through with support from the  Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which has offered unconditional support.
NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said his party wanted a stable government, but did not clarify whether his party will vote in favour of the BJP or abstain from voting - both moves will help chief minister Devendra Fadnavis win the floor test.

In the 288-member assembly, the BJP has 121 MLAs - down from 122 after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26. While the Shiv Sena has 63, the Congress has 42 and the NCP has 41 legislators.
Sources close to Fadnavis told HT the CM was sitting pretty with 138 MLAs - only seven short of a majority in the 288-member house.
Apart from its 121 MLAs, the BJP is believed have the support of one legislator from ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, seven independents, three MLAs from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, three from the Peasants and Workers' Party and three from other small parties, insiders said.
Reports said the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) will support the BJP government. Though the MNS has just one MLA, its support to the BJP would be symbolically significant as the party is headed by Uddhav's estranged cousin, Raj Thackeray.
Amid the uncertainty, the BJP, however, passed the first test of the day when its candidate for the speaker's post, Haribhau Bagade, was elected unopposed.
The Congress and the Shiv Sena both withdrew their candidates from the contest ahead of voting, apparently after being requested by the BJP.
But, the second and big challenge ahead of BJP might be marred by the Sena's stand. Even if it wins the trust vote, Sena legislators in the opposition bench might spell trouble for the Fadnavis government.  
The Sena has occupied the opposition benches in a special three-day assembly session - in line with Uddhav's threat that his party will oppose the BJP if it accepts the NCP's support.
Sena's Kadam said his party won't mortgage "self-respect", and will "vote against the government".
He, however, added the Sena leadership was still in talks with the BJP, indicating there could be an eleventh hour breakthrough in discussions over power-sharing deal in the state.
Talks between the two parties, which parted ways ahead of the October elections after 25 years of bonhomie following differences over sharing of seats, have remained topsy-turvy so far.
In mouthpiece Saamna, Sena lashed out at both the BJP and the NCP on Wednesday.
"CM Fadnavis and allies will ensure the government's survival. We have no doubt about that. But the important and real question is: whose tune will you dance to just to ensure the government's survival?"
Taking the fight forward, BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said, "Shiv Sena's decision (to not support the BJP) is purely to benefit their party. It's not in the interests of Maharashtra."
However, it is believed the Sena would be the BJP's first choice for an ally because of their matching ideologies and experience of working together.
But, Sena's reported demand for 10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister is vehemently opposed by the BJP leadership.
Meanwhile, some Sena leaders claimed the BJP's top brass in Delhi, including finance minister Arun Jaitley, were in constant touch with their leaders on Tuesday night and this may result in a positive outcome at the last moment.

Silent suffering: India s women are on their ownprint
In a 24x7 news cycle, there are very few stories that manage to grab a reader's attention - and hold it for a considerable period of time. Yet there are many among those discarded ones that need to be retold because they - and the disturbing issues they raise - are far too important to ignore.
One such is that of Rani's (name changed). Last week, this 45-year-old woman was stripped naked and paraded through a village in Rajasthan on a donkey. Her face was blackened with coal and her hair was cut to ensure that her public humiliation was complete.
Rani was accused of killing her nephew, Vardi Singh, by Singh's wife and the local khap panchayat (KP). Khaps are community groups that comprise elderly men from a community and they are known to deliver "instant justice" that defies all set legal parameters.
The police, however, believe that Singh killed himself in the Rajsamand district of Rajasthan on November 2. Singh's family approached the police and when they "did not act", they went to the local khap. Rani's ordeal came to light when her husband lodged a complaint with the police. They arrested 30 people on Sunday, including nine members of her family.
This is not the first time that such an incident has happened in the country. And, this one won't be the last either. That's because several interconnected issues/norms lead to such manifestations/incidents at regular intervals in this country.
First is society's shocking silence against such crimes against women, especially on those that take place in some remote corner of India and are not covered by the 'mainstream' media.
Second, vote bank-conscious politicians are afraid (and this is despite several court rulings) to ban these kangaroo courts because they control large chunks of votes and are useful during elections.
Third, the failure of the legal machinery to provide an easy, inexpensive judicial route to the people so that they don't end up in these courts that only believe in mob justice.
Fourth, the police's failure to redress complaints quickly and effectively. If they had heard Vardi Singh's family when they approached them and taken proactive steps to tackle the case then possibly they would not have approached the khap and Rani would have been spared of such a disgusting experience.
Fifth, KPs are male-dominated, closed worlds and give two hoots to women and gender justice. Unsurprisingly, they often use different kinds of violence to punish 'erring' women.
Would this anti-women mindset ever change?
Patriarchal mindsets that treat women as second-class citizens will not change unless and until families change their own belief systems, boys and young men are taught to respect women and they are included in structured gender sensitisation programmes. At present, the government's gender sensitisation programmes target women, teaching them how to tackle this unequal society.
"Men need to practice new masculinity... They need to cede control of power," actor-activist Rahul Bose said on Monday at the inauguration of the MenEngage Global Symposium being held in New Delhi ( http://menengage.org/ ).
Academics and practitioners at the conference are discussing how to engage men and boys for healthier, safer women and society.
Of course, what Bose advocated is easier said than done. It is the social conditioning of young men and boys, the warped notions of masculinity and behaviour, which are drilled into them in private and public spheres, end up producing individuals like the members of the khap we are discussing.
In fact, gender activists argue that socialisation of boys, including the role of violence in the disciplining process at home and in institutions, has implications for men's behaviours in later in their lives. Men's acceptance and reinforcement of traditional gender norms not only enhance male 'privilege' but also perpetuates and creates new forms of gender discriminatory practices.
Coming back to Rani, reports say she has now been sent to therapists to overcome the trauma that she endured.
But what about the men? They need help too. Only a stint in the jail will never be enough to change the khap members. As they say, old habits die hard.
And so do the boys and young men, who look up to these khap stars as their role models in the village.
Blaming khaps for punishing women and subverting legal mechanisms and banning such groups would be just short-term measures. For a safer society, we must go beyond the obvious and treat several other deep-seated ailments that afflicts society.

Mahindra & Mahindra hikes vehicle pricesMahindra & Mahindra hikes passenger, commercial vehicle prices

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Mahindra & Mahindra (MAHM.NS), India's top utility vehicle maker, has increased prices of its passenger and commercial vehicles by an average 1 percent effective this month to offset rising input costs, the company said on Tuesday.
The increase will be in the range of 2,300 rupees ($37) to 11,500 rupees ($187) depending on the model, it said in a statement to the stock exchange.
"We have been holding back on price hikes for a while but now it has been necessitated to partly offset the impact of rising input costs," said Pravin Shah, chief executive, automotive division & international operations at Mahindra.
The company, part of the $17 billion Mahindra Group, has also increased the price of its tractors by between 6,000 rupees ($97) and 10,000 rupees ($162) to offset an increase in commodity prices and conversion costs.
Mahindra is the world's largest manufacturer of tractors by volume.

Chennai, Nov 12:  
Banking, ATM services and cheque transactions in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Puducherry were affected today as employee unions went on a one-day country-wide strike to press for wage revision.
About 10 lakh employees and officers of public sector banks, private sector banks and regional rural banks are participating in the strike, All India Bank Employees Association General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said.
In Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, about 60,000 employees are participating in the strike, he said.
All India Bank Employees’ Association, Bank Employees Federation of India, All India Bank Officers’ Association and National Union of Bank Employees are taking part in the strike. All India Trade Union Congress has also extended its support for the strike.
Referring to the failure of the two-rounds of talks with the Labour Commissioner, he said: “The bank unions’ demands are quite reasonable and workable. If the Indian Banks’ Association came with an improved offer, an amicable settlement can be reached.”
“The Indian Banks’ Association must shed its obstinacy. The Government must intervene. Otherwise United Forum of Bank Unions will be compelled to further intensify its agitation,” he said.

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
Boosting domestic tourism and cleaning all heritage places within three months will be the priority, the newly inducted Minister of State for Tourism (Independent Charge), Mahesh Sharma, said on Wednesday.
“My first proposal will be to set up tourist facilitation centres for international as well as domestic tourists and focus on cleanliness, security, and reception for tourists,” he said.
Stating that India has not been able to reach where it should have with respect to tourist arrivals, the minister said that he will not look at the past but look at opportunities such as medical tourism. The 55-year-old BJP MP from Gautam Buddha Nagar is a doctor by profession and the owner of Kailash Group of Hospitals.
On poor connectivity between airports, he said that he will propose helicopter services at 47 international airports for foreign tourists along the lines of the service offered in religious destination Vaishnodevi. Sharma is also the Minister of State for Civil Aviation and Minister of State for Culture (Independent Charge).

Sensex hits new record-high of 28 114; Nifty breaches 8 400-levelSensex jumps 99 points to 28,009 on sustained capital inflows
Our Bureau/Agencies

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by nearly 99 points at 28,008.90 on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors despite weak global cues.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty ended higher by 20.65 points at 8,383.30.
Among BSE sectoral indices, auto and banking indices were the star-performers and were up 1.18 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.37 per cent, followed by metal 0.9 per cent, PSU 0.57 per cent and capital goods 0.53 per cent.
Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and ITC were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel, NTPC and L&T.
The benchmark BSE Sensex surged 203.97 points or 0.73 per cent to trade at a new record-high of 28,114.03 in the morning session, breaking its previous peak of 28,027.96 reached on November 10.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade and hit a new life-time high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-share NSE index crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points or 0.53 per cent to trade at a life-time high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said that the domestic sentiment remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed the trading sentiment, they added.
A report by Equentis Capital said: "We expect markets likely to remain positive. Stay cautious and book profits on higher levels. The government will unveil IIP data for September 2014 and annual rate of inflation based on the combined consumer price indices (CPI) for urban and rural India for October 2014 on 12 November 2014. Inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for October 2014 will be released on 14 November 2014. Slower inflation could support regulators (RBI) to increase liquidity in the market in short-term and positive action by the regulators will be good for interest sensitive sectors/stocks."
European stocks
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS , Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Asian shares
Asian stocks extended their gains for the fourth day as Japanese shares climbed after the yen depreciated to a seven-year low amid speculation the nation will delay raising its sales tax again.
Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Nikkei 225 rose 73 points or 0.43 per cent at 17,197 and Hang Seng jumped 184.08 points or 0.77 per cent at 23,992.36.

General Motors to shed over 500 jobs in at two US plantsMercedes Benz inaugurates Chandigarh's largest dealership
General Motors, under investigation because of defective ignition switches linked to at least 32 deaths, is to cut more than 500 jobs at two plants in the United States.
Approximately 160 employees will be laid off during 2015 at a factory in Orion, Michigan to “better align with market demand,” the company said in an email to AFP, and a plant in Lansing, in the same state, will eliminate 350 of its 1,500 positions for the same reason.
“GM is committed to a strong and lasting presence in Lansing,” a spokesman said, adding that the US auto giant had pledged USD 281.5 million in investment for Lansing-based facilities since 2013.
General Motors last month reported lower third-quarter earnings on weakness in some international markets.
GM is under investigation by Congress, regulators and the US Justice Department over why it waited more than a decade after first uncovering the ignition-switch problem to start recalling cars.

The Hudhud-ravaged coalshed of Sarda Metals and Alloys at Kantakapalli in Vizianagaram district. - CV. Subrahmanyam
Visakhapatnam, Nov 11:  
The ferro-alloys unit of Sarda Metals & Alloys Ltd at Kantakapalli village in the Kothavalasa mandal of Vizianagaram district, 35 km from here, was hit hard by cyclone Hudhud a month ago, sustaining a total loss of Rs 25 crores or so, but it has got back into stride and resumed full production.
The unit has also a captive thermal power plant of 80 MWs which has also resumed full-scale power generation and is now supplying the additional power of 30 MWs or so to the state grid.
Neeraj Sarda, Director of Sarda Metals & Alloys Ltd., said that within a day of power supply for start-up operation from Pendurthy sub-station, the captive power plant resumed power generation.
He said, "We have been successful in reviving production of silicon manganese for export market and ferro manganese for various steel plants in India."
He said the SMAL, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Raipur-based Sarda Energy & Minerals Ltd (SEML), a listed company known for low-cost production of ferro alloys, iron, billets, ingots and TMT bars, had completed the first phase of its project in the Vizianagaram district with an investment of Rs 730 crore.
He said the company had acquired 280.96 acres from the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation for the plant. At present, the plant is generating 80 MWs of power and producing 1.25 lakh to 1.5 lakh tonnes of silicon manganese and ferro manganese per annum.
It also has plans to expand its capacity and set up two more power generation units each with a capacity of 80 MW apiece. Now, the company has two 33 MVA furnaces in the ferro-alloys plant.
He said, “The coal shed, casting and insulation at our plant suffered heavy damage. In fact, we have to build the coal shed afresh at a cost of Rs 10 crore or so as it suffered extensive damage in the heavy gales."
The coal shed with a height of 40 metre, storage capacity of 32,000 tonne and built with 500 tonne of steel, will take one and half years for reconstruction. The damaged one was built with a China firm’s collaboration.
Sarda said the devastated shed had the ability to withstand a wind speed of 200 km per hour. Now it is proposed to design a new one to absorb wind speeds of 300 km per hour.
He said the expansion plans would take some more time.

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
The Government plans to address labour issues, the infrastructure deficit and the high cost of capital soon to meet the “uphill tasks” of raising the share of manufacturing in GDP from 15 to 25 per cent, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said here today.
“I still find in merchandise products, our cost of capital, our labour regime, our infrastructure, the improvements which are required in our trade facilitation — these still have to be assisted in order to bring down the prices of our manufactured products,” he said.
“And as part of the ‘Make in India’ campaign these are special areas which we will have to address and address very soon. We are in the process of doing so,” he said.
India is endeavouring to become a global manufacturing hub, he said at an event organised by Ministry of Commerce.
Noting that real job creation is in the manufacturing sector, he said: “That’s why one of our national challenges is that 15 per cent-odd share of manufacturing today has to be increased to 25 per cent. But that’s an uphill task and, therefore, that leaves us essentially with the services sector whose growth is a low hanging fruit in India.”
Services sector is an area where there is huge space to grow and India has potential to grow, he said.
“I have a lurking suspicion that the services sector would occupy about 60 per cent of the GDP space...this is one sector where Governmental interference is minimal,” he said.
The second aspect is that India has proved to be a competent services provider globally.
“Our success in IT and ITeS are well known... Several US Presidents have tried to impose restrictive regimes on outsourced services to save jobs in the US.
“But that indirectly translated in simple languages means that you are compelling US consumers to buy costlier services from within their own country when the same service is available almost in same real time at a fraction of that cost outside. These rules have substantially not succeeded,” he said.
Talking about the sunrise sector, the Finance Minister said India is beginning to create an impact in the pharma sector.
The other sectors which have potential for growth are healthcare, research and development, tourism and education.
“I think these are areas we need to be aggressive on,” he added.

MFs exposure to bank stocks surges to Rs 63 000 cr in OctoberMFs exposure to bank stocks surges to Rs 63,000 cr in October

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
Mutual fund managers raised their exposure in bank stocks to an all-time high of nearly Rs 63,000 crore in October this year amid a rally in the stock market.
The move comes after fund managers dropped their investment levels in bank stocks in September, after raising it for seven consecutive months.
According to the latest data available with Securities and Exchange Board of India, MF investments in bank stocks as on October 31 surged to Rs 62,718 crore, accounting for 19.91 per cent of the total equity assets under management (AUMs) of Rs 3.15 lakh crore.
The previous high was in August this year when investment in the sector climbed to Rs 56,625 crore.
In comparison, the MF industry’s exposure to banking sector stood at Rs 55,398 crore in September this year.
MFs had been raising their exposure to banking shares since January.
Software was the second most preferred sector with MFs last month with an exposure of Rs 32,838 crore, followed by pharma (Rs 21,845 crore), auto (Rs 20,282 crore) and finance (Rs 17,843 crore).
Mutual funds are investment vehicles made up of a pool of funds collected from a large number of investors. MFs invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
According to market participants, MFs have been showing interest in banking stocks since the beginning of the year amid rising equity market.
They believe that the ongoing market rally might see mutual fund assets getting diversified.
Meanwhile, the banking index (bankex) shot up by nearly 11 per cent in October this year, while the 30-scrip BSE Sensex rose 4.64 per cent.
This year has seen a consistent growth in investment in banking stocks by equity fund managers with fund infusion growing from Rs 30,339 crore in January to Rs 62,718 crore in October.
In percentage term, exposure has risen from 16.6 per cent to 19.91 per cent during the period.

India services sector PMI plunges from 51.6 to 50 during October  says HSBCPrint
By: PTI | Posted: November 5, 2014 12:33 pm
Services sector activity in India stagnated during October amid weaker growth of new business orders, an HSBC survey said today.
The HSBC India Services Business Activity Index, that tracks changes in activity at Indian services companies on a month-by-month basis, fell from 51.6 to exactly 50.0 in October.
A figure above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, while a figure below that level means contraction.
The stagnation in services sector activity follows five successive months of growth amid fall in new business orders, the report said.
“Services sector activity was unchanged in October since growth in some sectors was offset by contraction in others such as in the hospitality sector,” HSBC Co-Head of Asian Economic Research Frederic Neumann said.
Meanwhile, the headline HSBC Composite Output Index — that maps the manufacturing as well as the services sector output — stood at 51, down from 51.8 in September, indicating that growth of private sector output in India eased to the weakest in five months.
However, services sector firms in India remained highly optimistic regarding prospects for activity growth in the coming year.
Business sentiment was the strongest in three months, with panelists commenting on anticipated improvements in demand and new marketing initiatives as key sources of optimism, the report said.
“On the positive side, business confidence rose to the strongest in three months, with the hospitality sector being the most upbeat about the outlook,” Neumann said.
Neumann added: “the revival of reforms post recent state elections, if sustained, should lift growth on a broad basis.”

Indias gas deficit to continue on Narendra Modi govts unimpressive new policy: CIMB GroupExisting deepwater gas discoveries, mostly in the KG basin, are not viable at the new gas price of $5.61. (Reuters)
By: PTI | New Delhi | Posted: November 6, 2014 4:50 pm
India’s natural gas deficit and its reliance on imports will continue as the just-announced gas pricing policy by the Narendra Modi govt with its low rates and lack of roadmap to free pricing may not revitalise near stagnant exploration and production, a research report said today.
Existing gas discoveries in deepsea areas of Bay of Bengal are not viable at the new gas price of USD 5.61 per million British thermal unit, which is just 33 per cent higher than old rate of USD 4.2, it added.
“The new gas pricing policy is unlikely to revitalise Indian exploration and production (E&P),” Kuala Lumpur-based CIMB Group said in its report on India’s oil and gas scenario.
Besides raising price of gas from existing fields, the government had also on October 18 announced that a yet-to-be- determined premium will be paid for new discoveries in deepwater and difficult projects.
“The exclusion of existing deepwater fields from premium pricing may hamper the production prospects of some key Krishna Godavari basin blocks.
“The lack of a roadmap to free gas pricing, possibility of internal rate of return (IRR)-based application of pricing premium and Government of India’s differentiation between reasonable and windfall profits (perhaps erroneous) may fail to boost exploration,” it said.
Stating that existing deepwater gas discoveries, mostly in the KG basin, are not viable at the new gas price of USD 5.61, CIMB Group said, “the denial of premium pricing to the existing discovered fields may have rendered the development of these fields uncertain.”
In the past, the absence of commercially viable gas prices had not only discouraged high-risk new exploration activity but also hindered the development of some of the existing discoveries, such as the satellite fields in the Reliance Industries’ eastern offshore KG-D6 block.
“Building a 3 per cent natural decline rate to the existing production of 88 million standard cubic meters per day, we estimate that India’s total gas production, including the new gas discoveries, can reach about 154-155 mmscmd by 2020-21 – still unlikely to surpass the previous peak of 155 mmscmd achieved in March 2010,” CIMB said.
It said its “study indicates that India’s gas deficit is unlikely to improve over the next 5-6 years implying that reliance on (imported) liquefied natural gas (LNG) is unlikely to abate.”
In the nine New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) rounds since 1999, 131 discoveries have been reported in 41 blocks, 86 (2/3rd) of which are gas discoveries that will require higher gas prices and greater scale of operations to be viable, it said.
CIMB said 15 years since the launch of the NELP, under which 254 blocks or areas were awarded to firms like RIL and ONGC for exploring and producing oil and gas, just one block is materially producing and only continued…

Power sector needs $250 bn over 5 yearsBy: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: November 7, 2014 12:52 am | Updated: November 7, 2014 6:05 am
Coal and Power Minister Piyush Goyal speaks at
the India Economic Summit 2014 in New Delhi on Thursday. (Source: Reuters)
Making a case for doubling the country’s power generation capacity over the next five years, the minister for power, coal and renewable energy, Piyush Goyal, on Thursday said that the sector needs an investment of $250 billion during the period to meet the rising industrial needs and ensure that electricity can be delivered to a fourth of the population that does not have access to it currently.
While $100 billion investment is being targeted for renewable energy and $50 billion for transmission, Goyal said that the bulk of investment will have to come from the private sector.
He, however, added that the government would also invest more for the same Stating that the government is looking to provide power for all, he said, “I am hopeful that in 2019 when we go for the next general elections we have provided power to all houses, offices and other establishments.”
Drawing the importance of nuclear power that has the “potential” to resolve India’s energy shortage, Goyal, while speaking at the India Economic Summit organised by the World Economic Forum and industry chamber CII, said that it has some issues.
“We want to be sure that we are not saddled with something that has been discarded by the West. We have to be clear on what we are getting,” he said.
While fuel supply has emerged as a huge issue for various power plants that have come up in the recent past, the minister said that new government is hopeful that fuel supply issue will be addressed over the next few years as a result of the steps taken in that direction.
He said that coal production will be doubled to 1 billion tonnes by 2019 from around 500 million tonnes now and the revised gas pricing will also result in increased development and discovery.
Reforms can co-exist with social benefits: Naidu
New Delhi: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday outlined his plans to re-build the divided Andhra Pradesh with three mega cities, uninterrupted water and power supply to all families, road connectivity across villages and 100 Mbps data connectivity to all households in the state.
While wooing investors to his state at the India Economic Summit, Naidu said that he would continue with reforms but keep the mandate of the people.
“We have to explain that economic reforms are not against the common man … there is no need to shout for reforms, we can implement reforms and also introduce social benefits. If you can integrate these two, then you can have inclusive growth,” he said at a session.
Naidu, who took back the reins of Andhra Pradesh after a gap of 10 years, also laid out ambitious plans to make the state a favourable investment opportunity.

General Motors (GM), Honda, Toyota and Ford may be rolling out snazzy models and variants onto Indian roads every now and then, but all of them are still reporting huge losses even after having been present in the country for more than a decade now.
According to the latest filings made by these companies to the Registrar of Companies, ministry of corporate affairs, the accumulated losses of the Indian units of these players have jumped by 65% to R11,350 crore in 2013-14.
GM India, which has now been present in the country for close to two decades, is the biggest loss-maker, reporting losses of R3,847 crore in FY14, widening its accumulated losses to R6,587 crore.
While some companies took a hit due to slow sales and recall of defective cars, analysts said that the biggest reason for the losses is because most carmakers have committed heavy investments in both manufacturing capacity and marketing in order to challenge Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai, and with low volumes the break-even is proving elusive. The latter two together command over 60% market share of the country’s 25-lakh-unit passenger vehicles segment.
Gaurav Vangaal, automotive analyst for light vehicle forecasting at his, said, “Profits are essential to remain in business. This is a wake-up call for global manufacturers to remain competitive in India. India has a strategic importance in the global portfolio, especially looking at the long-term potential of the country. Global players need to carefully analyse their business model versus the market leaders.”
As part of its FY14 losses, GM India took an impairment of almost Rs 2,500 crore. Though the reasons for that were not quite clear, the company had been pulled up by the government for “corporate fraud” during the year, forcing it to undertake a major recall exercise for over 1 lakh of its Tavera MPVs, besides diesel variants of the Sail sedan and hatchback models. GM India, a 100% subsidiary of Hong Kong-based SAIC-GM Investment, has also seen its net worth go negative, leading the parent firm to recapitalise the company by infusing Rs 1,423 crore on conversion of a part of external commercial borrowings to equity shares.
“As per company policy, we do not disclose the financial of the company. We are also not a listed company in India,” P Balendran, GM India spokesperson, said in response to emailed queries about the losses.
Among others, the other US-based carmaker Ford saw losses at its domestic arm rise by 42% to Rs 597 crore and accumulated losses climb to Rs 2,360 crore. Incidentally, Ford is expected to start production at its second plant in Gujarat in early 2015. Japanese players Honda and Toyota also saw losses continued…

Dont push to end-use plants within state limits: Mines ministryIt is learnt that states like Chhattisgarh and Orissa have reservations on the bidding process.
Written by Priyadarshi Siddhanta | New Delhi | Posted: November 9, 2014 1:27 am
The mines ministry has asked the state governments to shed their insistence on setting up end-use plants within their boundaries and treat the country as a “single economic space”.
Since end users of minerals are spread across the country, their insistence on setting up plants may evoke mixed responses towards the impending auctioning of mining leases of major non-coal minerals.
The government is concerned that reluctance of the states to allow minerals extracted from within their boundaries to be used elsewhere may invite lukewarm response to the eventual competitive bidding of non-coal minerals like iron ore and bauxite.
It has already short-listed 31 mining leases to be auctioned to prospective bidders by April next year and 150 leases through 2015.
Although preparations are on to promote competitive bidding, the states would have to come on board as they would be executing the mining agreements with the winning bidders. Their established position is that minerals extracted within their territorial domain should be value added there and not outside, a senior mines ministry official pointed out.
But the National Mineral Policy 2008 says that mineral processing units should not only get an assured supply of the mineral raw material but should also have close links with the production and marketing agencies of the mineral based end products.
“Mining as a backward linkage and Value addition within the same state as a forward linkage will, therefore, be encouraged,” says the policy.
It is learnt that states like Chhattisgarh and Orissa have reservations on the bidding process. This is because they feel that this could encourage companies to leave a infrastructure deficient state for other locations which have better evacuation mechanisms and potential markets, the official reasoned.
This offers a direct challenge to the demand for value-addition by the states within their boundaries as the winning bidders can buy mining rights through auction and then ship the mineral to any part of the country for processing it after paying royalty.
Steel plants have traditionally come up in the backward areas and have contributed immensely in uplifting the economic landscape of those places, which these states have maintained.
However, the government is moving ahead with the auctioning of 31 mines in the first phase and it is understood to have decided to invite financial bids wherein the intrinsic value of the mineral would be captured through the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach.
The DCF methodology uses future free cash flow projections and discounts them (most often using the weighted average cost of capital) to arrive at a present value, which is used to evaluate the potential for an investment proposal, the official said.

PM Modi to focus on trade relations  logistics at India-ASEAN summitPrint
By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: November 9, 2014 1:39 am
In a bid to step up India’s engagement with the 10-nation ASEAN bloc, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to make a strong pitch for improving regional connectivity to give a boost to trade and people-to-people contact at the upcoming summit meeting next week.
Modi is slated to leave for Myanmar on Tuesday to attend the 12th ASEAN-India summit on November 12 and the 9th East Asian summit on November 13 on the first leg of his three-nation foreign tour that will also take him to Australia and Fiji.
Giving a broad overview of the summits, Anil Wadhwa, Secretary (East) in the External Affairs Ministry, said India is keen that the next ASEAN-India five-year plan of action starting 2016 should focus on improving people-to-people contact, ramping up trade relations and reinforcing the strategic engagement.
The plan will also focus on security architecture in the region, he said. There could be progress on a project to develop a 3,200-km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand that was originally envisaged to be completed by end-2017. It is now expected to be completed in 2018. Wadhwa said India and the 10-nation ASEAN bloc hope to dovetail the connectivity plans with this highway project.
Modi in a tweet earlier this week said that India’s ties with ASEAN are “deep rooted” and that strengthening relations with the nations in the grouping are an important part of its ‘Act East’ policy”.
He said he looked forward to meeting leaders attending the two summits in Myanmar. “ASEAN is central to our dream of an Asian century, where India will play a crucial role. Am sure the meetings there would be fruitful,” he had said.

Exceptionally good conditions in place for 10 pct growth: Deepak ParekhDeepak Parekh today said India currently has "exceptionally good conditions" in place to aspire for 10 per cent economic growth. (Reuters)

Bullish over robust fundamentals and improving macroeconomic conditions, industry leader Deepak Parekh today said India currently has “exceptionally good conditions” in place to aspire for 10 per cent economic growth but much needs to be done to achieve that target.
While stating that a 10 per cent GDP growth was certainly achievable, Parekh, however, said he would not “hazard a guess” on the time frame for achieving a double-digit growth.
“I try and think back and I can’t recall any other instance than now when India had rising stock markets, falling oil prices and a stable, majority government all at the same time.
“These are exceptionally good conditions to once again lay the foundation for the much-aspired 10% GDP growth for India,” he said while speaking at the ISB Capital Markets Conclave here.
Parekh, known for his candid views on issues related to Indian economy and markets, said it is “suffice to say that a 10 per cent GDP growth will not happen without extensive judicial, electoral, police, labour and land reforms, along with financial sector reforms.”
“At this juncture, much needs to be done to even attain a 6.5-7 per cent GDP growth rate.
“But yes, the picture had changed dramatically for India,” he said, while listing out three fundamental changes including improved confidence with the government being perceived as being able to deliver on growth and what is driving the present euphoria.
On the other two changes, he said: “India has a Prime Minister who leads from the front and key macro fundamentals are working in India’s favour”.
For the current fiscal, Parekh said the estimated GDP growth rate was 5.5-5.9 per cent, while adding that India has been performing significantly better than many other emerging markets.
He said the research analysts are already describing India as being on the top among the BRICs and the “best house” in a bad neighbourhood.
“And to borrow the latest buzz phrase from Bill Gross, India is considered the ‘cleanest dirty shirt’ amongst emerging markets,” he said, while adding that India has become the toast of the FII party as it is perceived as ‘less of a mess’ in comparison.
Parekh said that FIIs have invested USD 37 billion so far this year, including around USD 14 billion in equities and debt inflows of USD 23 billion.
“And while another new high of 28,000 has been touched, brokerage houses have long since sent the Sensex forecast sky high,” he added.
 

Lets base our energy needs on coal  wind  solar & hydro: JSPL MD Ravi UppalIndia has the world's fifth largest reserves of coal and supply bottlenecks have been forcing many power generators to import coal from abroad. (Reuters)
By: Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 8, 2014 5:11 pm
Stating that India needs to base its energy needs on “indigenous resources” like coal and hydro, Ravi Uppal the MD and CEO of Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL), said that the country “need not be miserly about using it’s own coal reserves”.
Speaking on the issue of “Energy security for India” at the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) annual knowledge summit — Connexions 2014 —, Uppal said, “Every country has it’s own model of meeting its energy needs like Sweden and Norway.
Energy is something that should come from your own society. Coal is our mainstay… There is no point in being miserly about using your own coal… Lets base our energy needs from what is indigenous like coal, hydro, solar and wind. That is the energy model to be followed.”
India has the world’s fifth largest reserves of coal and supply bottlenecks have been forcing many power generators to import coal from abroad. “It is an irony that India is sitting on 200 billion tonnes of coal reserves and a case is being made to import 170 million tonnes of coal,” said the official from JSPL, which was one of the companies affected by the Supreme Court’s cancellation of 214 coal blocks.
The comments from Uppal also comes at a time when the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) has called for phasing out of fossil fuels like coal by the end of the century.
Experts who spoke at the event expressed their displeasure on the amount of coal which is being imported inspite of the country having huge coal reserves. Naveen Munjal, director (commercial) of CLP India pointed out that countries like Thailand and China have banned sub-critical power plants and have replaced them with more efficient super critical and ultra super critical plants.
“There is also a need to delink the electricity regulatory commissions from politics, like the way Gujarat has done,” said Munjal while speaking at the event.
He said that political compulsions were forcing state electricity boards in several states to purchase power at higher rates and sell them at lower rates.

Domestic FIs beat FIIs: 6 factsIndia among top recipients of FII inflows. (Reuters)

For the first time in 14 months, monthly net investments into equities by domestic financial institutional (Domestic FIs) at $ 670 million exceeded net investments by FIIs at $145 million, says Deutsche Bank.
What does it mean: This further corroborates the thesis that the role of domestic investors will likely assume greater significance as the nature of savings of Indian households shifts away from physical assets to financial assets, on the back of easing macro imbalances and improving real interest rates.
India among top recipients of FII inflows: Even as FII flows into Indian equities abated sharply to $1 45 million (vs. the six-month average of $1.6 billion), India still emerged as the top recipient of FII flows amongst Asian emerging market peers.
On a YTD (year till date) basis too, India has witnessed the highest FII inflows into equities at $14 billion. FII flows into Indian debt, however, remained strong in Oct as well, coming in at $2.8 billion.
Sensex is trading at price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6x, one year forward, which is not too expensive given expectations of policy overdrive in an approaching election-free window, Deutsche Bank says
FY15 earnings revisions continue to moderate, with analysts raising earnings for 18 companies and cutting them for 26, while FY16 earnings revision saw 21 raises and 25 cuts.
 

RBI unlikely to relent to India Incs rate cut callPrint
Written by George Mathew | Mumbai | Posted: November 8, 2014 2:00 am
The strong pitch by Corporate India on the need to cut interest rates notwithstanding, indications are that the Reserve Bank of India may not oblige in the near term.
The RBI which has already indicated that “it is too early for celebrations” and that “inflation has a long way to go”, has been draining liquidity from the system through its open market operations. The RBI has already conducted five reverse repo auctions between October 29 and November 5 to enable banks park close to Rs 1,45,000 crore with the central bank. It has planned another Rs 25,000 crore reverse repo auction on Friday. Banks are sitting on excess liquidity, indicating that demand for credit has fallen.
This is even as consumer price inflation, which at 6.46 per cent in September, had slowed to its lowest level since the data was first published in January 2012. Local banks are awash with liquidity and the yield on the 10-year benchmark bonds declined to over one-year low levels of 8.20 per cent, contributing to the clamour for a rate cut. The RBI had hiked repo rate by 75 basis points to 8 per cent between September 2013 and January 2014. Since then, it has been maintaining the 8 per cent level to check inflation.
“I agree with the RBI observation it’s too early to celebrate. The base effect will come into play from next month… last year at the same time inflation was at around 12 per cent. The US quantitative easing issue is yet to come. It’s too early to say time has come for the rate cut,” said Krishnamurthy Harihar, Treasurer, Firstrand Bank.
VG Kannan, MD & group executive, State Bank of India, said, “Markets are expecting a rate cut. Commercial paper rates and bond yields have fallen. And banks are carrying surplus liquidity.” Many banks have slashed the deposit rate in the wake of declining credit offtake. According to Radhika Rao, Economist, DBS Bank, pressure is mounting on the RBI to cut rates at its upcoming review meeting in early December, but the central bank may not be swayed by the base effects-driven softening of inflation. Finance minister Arun Jaitley’s recent call to lower rates to encourage construction activity has revived expectations of a rate cut.
This is not surprising. In fact, analysts expect calls for rate cuts to intensify as the December rate review approaches, when weak September quarter GDP numbers and further softening in consumer price index (CPI) inflation will be on hand. Against this backdrop of weak growth and falling inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to face mounting pressure to ease rates at the December meeting. That said, the RBI will look past these base-effect swings to focus on anchoring inflationary expectations and ensuring medium-term stability.
Will a rate cut boost investment? “To be sure, the monetary policy tool of cutting the interest rate is conventionally used to energise a flagging economy. But this does not hold true under all circumstances. Our study shows that factors behind the recent continued…

Need synergy among PSBs to act against defaulters: FinMinUnder the Sarfaesi Act, banks are allowed to impound and later auction properties (residential and commercial) of defaulting borrowers.
Written by Priyadarshi Siddhanta | New Delhi | Posted: November 8, 2014 1:40 am
Citing poor coordination among public sector banks (PSBs) as the main reason for the rise in their non-performing assets, the finance ministry is set to direct them to join hands and mandatorily seize the assets of “wilful and hardcore defaulters”.
The ministry, in a communication to concerned departments last week, said, “Impounding of assets against wilful and hardcore defaulters has not picked up primarily because of lack of coordination among the bankers,” which negates the purpose of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (Sarfaesi Act), 2002.
Under the Sarfaesi Act, banks and financial institutions are allowed to impound and later auction properties (residential and commercial) of defaulting borrowers.
While implementation of the Act has been “half-hearted” during the last 10 years, the problem has compounded as there is no mechanism available for companies to wind up businesses and compensate stakeholders, the ministry said.
“While asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) have come up, there is more supply of restructured assets than there are buyers. The ARCs also pay very little against the securitised receipts issued by them and consequently there is no market for these receipts. The need of the hour is to encourage foreign investment in the stressed assets, because globally there are firms which specialise in handling them,” it stated.
Restructured assets in the banking system could increase in the range of Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 1,00,000 crore within the next five months, according to a study by India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).
The studysaid it found that top 500 corporate borrowers in the country have an aggregate debt of Rs 28,76,000 crore, which is 73 per cent of the total bank lending to corporates.
If some of these corporates do not generate significant cash flow in the near term, lenders may restructure their assets as per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines.
“The absence of a bankruptcy law has aggravated the crisis. Even if corporates want to wind up their insolvent businesses, they cannot do it,” a finance ministry official said. The government has set up the Committee under former law secretary TK Viswanathan on October 20 and has tasked it with studying the corporate legal bankruptcy framework in India and make suggestions.
Its ‘terms of reference’ include early detection and resolution of financial distress, protecting interest of stakeholders, study rescue mechanisms and ways to improve, examining the role of the institutions engaged in the process of rescue and liquidation and liquidation procedure for smaller companies.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley, in Budget 2014-15, had said that the government would bring out an entrepreneur-friendly legal bankruptcy framework for small and medium enterprises to enable easy exits.

JLR owner Cyrus Mistry seeks nod to import most beautiful 1971 E-typeThe Jaguar E-type is considered a classic among cars designed and produced in the world ever.
Written by Shruti Srivastava | New Delhi | Posted: November 8, 2014 1:43 am
TATA Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry has sought the government’s permission to import an E-type Jaguar of 1971 vintage, which was famously described by Enzo Ferrari, the founder of the eponymous Italian sports car manufacturer as “the most beautiful car ever made”.
The permission has been sought from the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) because, as per the import policy, a second-hand or used vehicle can be imported only against authorisation.
Further, the import of such vehicles is subject to the condition that it “shall not be older than three years from the date of manufacture; have right hand steering, and controls (applicable on vehicles other than two and three wheelers); have a speedometer indicating the speed in kilometres”.
It is in view of this that the permission has been sought, a Tata Group spokesperson explained.
“A response to the application is awaited… All procedural requirements will be complied with and all the necessary charges and duties will be paid,” the spokesperson added.
Currently, import of vehicles by foreign diplomats and others belonging to this category exempt from payment of customs duty.
However, private citizens and other individuals have to pay a duty of over 100 per cent for importing a used vehicle.
When the Tata Group had bought the marquee Jaguar Land Rover brand in 2008 from Ford Motor, the move was questioned by industry experts.
However, as Mukund Rajan, a member of the Group Executive Council at Tata Sons, said last year, “At the time, it was seen as a dodgy investment. It is interesting how things have turned out very differently… We think JLR has been a very happy convergence… it has really worked out well.”
In May, Jaguar Land Rover Heritage Business had announced that it will build six brand new ‘lightweight’ E-types from the intended 18-car series.
According to the announcement, “The all-aluminium cars will be assigned the six remaining chassis numbers which were originally allocated in 1963. All six vehicles will be built as perfect reproductions and to the exact specifications of the original 12 cars first produced in 1963….
“Only 12 of the aluminium bodied Lightweight E-types were eventually built, the last in 1964, the remaining six designated chassis numbers having lain dormant, until now.”

Telecom Commission sends back spectrum pricing proposal to TraiTelecom operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone have exhausted their 20-year licence period in circles including Delhi, and will soon in Mumbai and Kolkata.
By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: November 8, 2014 1:45 am
The impasse between the department of telecommunications and operators continues to linger. The inter-departmental secretaries’ panel, Telecom Commission has asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to reconsider its recommendations on valuation of spectrum valuation and pricing norms.
Agency reports quoting a an official of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said, “The Commission today decided to send back reference to Trai as some clarification is required on some of the recommendations. Some recommendations also cannot be implemented.” Trai will now have to debate the issues again.
Telecom operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone have exhausted their 20-year licence period in circles including Delhi, and will soon in Mumbai and Kolkata.
They have won back some of the spectrum at the auctions held in February but have got the possession of those airwaves only now in October.
The spectrum they have won in the 900 MHz band has technical specifications different from what they were using so far, and would need about 16 weeks to re-align their services. The changeover has to come into operation in Delhi by the first week of December.
This problem could have been avoided if the telcos had a backup in the 1800 MHz band, but the amount they have is far less than what is needed.
Seconding their position, Trai had sent a letter to the DoT. The letter from Trai chairman Rahul Khullar to telecom secretary Rakesh Garg noted “the delay in assigning spectrum in the 1800 MHz band may lead to a partial breakdown of services offered by these two operators especially in Delhi”, adding that the two operators have a subscriber base of 20 million.
This issue was left undecided by the Commission. On the issue of auctions next February, the problem is the available spectrum is extremely limited. For more spectrum to be made available, it has to be vacated by the defence ministry or state-owned BSNL.
Trai has asked DoT to clarify if talks with defence ministry to release an additional block of 5 MHz in the 2100 MHz band has occurred and its outcome.

Income inequality  jobless growth key concerns for leaders: WEFDeepening income inequality and jobless growth head the top 10 trends for 2015. (Reuters)
By: PTI | New Delhi/geneva | Posted: November 7, 2014 4:41 pm
Income inequality and jobless growth are two of the most significant challenges facing the world today, says a World Economic Forum report.
According to the Outlook on the Global Agenda, deepening income inequality and jobless growth head the top 10 trends for 2015.
Top 10 trends for 2015 are deepening income inequality; jobless growth; lack of leadership; rising geostrategic competition; weakening of representative democracy; rising pollution in developing world; rising occurrence of severe weather events; intensifying nationalism increasing water stress and growing importance of health in the economy.
The trends are based on a survey of almost 1,800 experts from the Forum’s network of global agenda councils as well as other communities within the World Economic Forum on what they believe would preoccupy leaders over the coming 12-18 months.
Amid growing severity of economic and political trends the ‘lack of leadership’ as a trend has gained significant prominence this year as this has climbed from 7th last year to 3rd place this year, the report said.
However, the challenges facing leaders are not limited to economics and politics alone, but also environmental.
Experts flagged rising pollution in the developing world (6th), increasing occurrence of severe weather events (7th) and increasing water stress as severe concerns.
“All these have the potential to inflict further social, economic and political instability globally,” the report said.
Rounding out the top 10 trends is “growing importance of health in the economy”, which is an opportunity as well as a challenge.
Increasing importance of health in the economy is indicative of the symbiotic link between a healthy population and a healthy economy, the report said.
It also represents an opportunity for leaders, with technology opening up possibilities for better and more cost effective healthcare, which could in turn lead to sustainable economic growth and greater prosperity, the report added.
“Today’s challenges, which are global in scope, heavily interlinked in nature and critical in urgency, will only be addressed through greater understanding and stronger collaboration by all stakeholders,” said Espen Barth Eide, Managing Director and Member of the Managing Board, World Economic Forum.

Inflation has a long way to go  says RBI deputy governor H R KhanRBI believes there is still time for inflation to ease as input costs remain high. (Reuters)

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) believes there is still time for inflation to ease as input costs remain high and food inflation is structural.
“Inflation has a long way to go,” said RBI deputy governor H R Khan at a speech in an event here today adding that markets have perhaps become complacent.
India’s retail inflation has eased to 6.46% in September led by a drop in food as well as fuel inflation. The RBI has stated that it aims to bring down inflation to 8% by January 2015 and to 6% by January 2016.
The RBI will release its bi-monthly policy on December 2. On the back of the recent sharp fall in retail inflation along with a drop in global crude oil prices, expectations of a rate cut have gained momentum in markets off late. Bond yields have fallen to a 15-month low on such expectations. The 10-year 8.40%, 2024 benchmark bond is trading around 8.20% today.
Khan said that the fall in global crude oil prices was a “boon” for India. Brent crude has fallen nearly $20 per barrel over the last two months. The soft oil prices along with a stable currency augurs well for domestic inflation as well as the currenct account deficit position of the country.

Stock markets took a breather today with benchmark Sensex falling about 47 points in volatile trade, retreating from record highs, as investors booked profits in banking, metal and capital goods sector stocks.
After remaining positive in early trade, the Sensex touched the day’s high of 27,980.93. However, investors took some profits off the table at near record levels which pushed the BSE index to day’s low of 27,739.56. A round of buying at the fag-end helped to trim losses.

Among Sensex components, 21 stocks including BHEL, GAIL, Coal India, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Steel and Hindalco fell.
In the previous session on Wednesday, the 30-share Sensex had ended at its all-time closing high of 27,915.88 after touching an intra-day record high of 28,010.39. Continued foreign fund inflows on government’s reform push amid hopes of a rate cut by the RBI had fuelled the rally.
Likewise, the 50-scrip NSE barometer Nifty, which had gained 14.15 points in the previous session, fell 1.30 points, or 0.02 per cent, to close at 8,337.00.

Banking sector stocks saw a round of selling after remaining outperformers in the recent rally. Major losers were SBI and HDFC Bank.
Bucking the overall trend, shares in healthcare, realty, consumer durables and IT sectors continued their upward march.
Shares of DLF rose over 6 per cent after the Securities Appellate Tribunal allowed the realty giant to redeem mutual funds worth Rs 1,806 crore. Traders said market was in an over-bought position and participants preferred to lock gains at lifetime highs.

Indian e-commerce market to reach $ 20 bn next year: ReportE-commerce market in the country is expected to grow 37 per cent to reach USD 20 billion by next year. (Thinkstock)

The e-commerce market in the country is expected to grow 37 per cent to reach USD 20 billion by next year on the back of growing internet population and increased online shoppers, a report has said.
“E-commerce in India is a USD 11 billion market, and is estimated to reach USD 20 billion by 2015, growing at a CAGR of 37 per cent over 2013-15,” Motilal Oswal Securities said in its report on e-commerce.
The research firm said their are multiple enablers for this growth which include increase in the number of internet users and an increased proportion of online shoppers within those users, growth in the per-shopper transaction value and continued flow of capital by willing investors.
The report said currently online travel dominates the e-commerce market but in the future, e-tailing will drive the growth.
Online travel constituted 71 per cent of the e-commerce market in India, followed by e-tailing (16 per cent). Travel has grown at a CAGR of 32 per cent over 2009-13.
“However, going forward, e-tailing will be the biggest growth driver, with expected CAGR of over 60 per cent to USD 7 billion in 2016 from USD 1.7 billion in 2013. Within e-tailing, fashion is likely to be the driving segment,” it said.
Fashion was USD 559 million in 2013, and estimates peg the growth in fashion e-tailing to anywhere between USD 3 billion and USD 6 billion by 2016.
The research firm said heavy discount on online sales is a direct reflection of the industry’s competitive intensity.
“The amount of money raised by Flipkart, lately Snapdeal, and that committed by Amazon is all yet to be invested, indicating that we may not be anywhere near the end of round-the-clock discount seasons at online stores,” it added.

SC convicts Nagarjuna Finance Limiteds K S Raju for contemptPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Posted: November 9, 2014 12:30 pm | Updated: November 9, 2014 4:19 pm
The Supreme Court has convicted K S Raju, Promoter Director of Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Finance Limited (NFL), for contempt of court for not refunding the money to its investors as directed by the Company Law board.
A bench of justices Vikramajit Sen and Prafulla C Pant allowed 60 days time to the company and Raju to return the money, failing which he has to undergo imprisonment for six months.
It upheld the single bench order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court which had convicted the company and Raju for contempt of court and awarded six months jail term and fine of Rs 2,000. The bench set aside the order passed by division bench of the high court which had set aside their conviction and sentence.
“If the amount is paid to the present appellant as directed by this court within 60 days, the sentence shall be reduced to the extent of fine only,” it said.
“In our opinion, K S Raju wilfully disobeyed the order of CLB and breached the undertaking given to CLB, and thereby committed Contempt of Court subordinate to HC as such the division bench of the High Court has erred in law in allowing the contempt appeal by Raju and setting aside his conviction and sentence, recorded against him by the learned single judge,” it said.
The bench passed the order on plea filed by one of the investors E Bapanaiah, who had deposited Rs 4 lakh with NFL in 1997 after the company promised that the amount would multiply to double within 45 months.
Bapanaiah had filed contempt petition in HC after the company failed to return the money alleging there is a wilful disobedience of order passed by Company Law Board, Southern Region Bench, and for breach of undertakings including one filed by Raju before CLB on refunding the money.

LPG subsidy fixed at Rs 568  price to change after MarchThe actual subsidy thus paid for consumers used to change in order to keep the price fixed at the level approved by the CCPA.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office has fixed the subsidy on domestic LPG at Rs 568 per cylinder — to be borne equally by the government and national oil companies (NOCs) — setting the stage for deregulating the pricing of domestic cooking gas.
However, the Prime Minister’s Office on October 22 also decided to keep the consumer price unchanged during the current fiscal year ending March 2015 after which the deliverable price could vary with the change in international price.
At the meeting, the PMO fixed the subsidy for domestic LPG at Rs 40 per kg (or Rs 568 per cylinder of 14.2 kg) to be shared between government and public sector upstream oil companies Oil & Natural Gas Corp, GAIL India and Oil India Ltd.
“Retail selling price of LPG would remain fixed up to March 2015 and any variations in procurement price of LPG by oil marketing companies (OMCs) will be adjusted through fixed compensation of Rs 20 per kg by the government and the balance Rs 20 per kg by upstream national oil companies,” says the proposal for the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA).
“Difference in subsidy admissible from NOCs and actual subsidy will be used when actual requirement of subsidy exceeds Rs 568 per cylinder… The position of actual subsidy requirement would be reviewed in March 2015,” it adds.
Under the system put in place by the UPA government, consumers were allowed 12 subsidised cylinders without any limit on how much loss would be borne by the OMCs.
The actual subsidy thus paid for consumers used to change in order to keep the price fixed at the level approved by the CCPA.
The CCPA proposal prepared by the petroleum ministry says that the PMO also decided that Rs 568 be transferred as the first time “permanent advance” to LPG consumers when the fixed subsidy scheme is launched in 15 districts from November 15 to cover the entire country by January 1, 2015.
The Modi government on October 18, when it decontrolled diesel pricing, announced a re-launch of the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme for LPG (DBTL) as part of fuel reforms. “Under the modified DBTL scheme, the subsidy on a domestic subsidised cylinder will be fixed,” an official statement had said.
When contacted, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said any surplus to the OMCs would be kept in a pool account and would be set off against higher international prices in future.
The proposed fixed subsidy is higher than current under-recovery of Rs 416.35 per cylinder but prices were expected to harden in the winter months of November to February, he added. The CCPA note on finalising the burden sharing mechanism for under-recovery of Rs 92,251 crores on sale of LPG, diesel and kerosene also proposes that:
Subsidy burden of Rs 10,821 crores on diesel until October 18 and Rs 28,382 crores on kerosene for continued…

India may sign WTOs Trade Facilitation Agreement: Study paperBy: Press Trust of India | Posted: November 10, 2014 3:47 pm
India may finally sign the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement following discussions with the US on the details of an indefinite “peace clause” on food security, according to a research paper discussing the effectiveness of the upcoming G20 summit.
The study paper by Melbourne-based think-tank Australia India Institute (AII) titled ‘The G20: Challenges and opportunities Ahead’, said following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US and his talks with US President Barack Obama, India may finally sign the agreement.
“As a part of a revised proposal, India and the US are reported to be discussing the details of an indefinite peace clause on food security until a permanent solution is found,” it said ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane starting November 16. Prime Minister Modi is also attending the summit.
“A peace clause would give legal security to member countries and protect them from challenges under other WTO agreements,” the paper said.
It cited that the G20, with its Doha Lite package, ensured the success of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Bali Ministerial Meeting.
“Though the legal texts and technical parameters including rules are still to be finalised, the meeting succeeded in addressing the core concerns of emerging and developing countries on maintaining public stockpiles of food grains for sale to poorer citizens at subsidised prices beyond permissible subsidy limits, in anticipation of a permanent solution,” it said.
“Some obstacles remain. India is trying to stall implementation of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), agreed to in Bali and has tied ratification of the agreement to a permanent solution to the contentious issue of public stockpiling of food grains,” it added.
The paper also highlighted that the G20 in Brisbane this month would be dominated by the issues of financial sector regulation, trade facilitation measures, protectionism, infrastructure investment and tax policy coordination.
“The G20, as a genuine summit of national leaders, can credibly implement meaningful measures. What is, however, desirable is a more focussed approach to increased economic growth across member nations, especially after the US financial crisis,” it said.
It also sought for strengthening the G20 and that it should be upgraded from a forum to an institution, in a bid to make implementating difficult measures such as structural reform easier and more effective.

Indian firms downsize cyber security budgetWith the rising threat of cyber security breaches and information leaks, spend on security has become one of the most important heads under a corporate’s yearly budget. (Thinkstock)
Posted: November 10, 2014 12:27 pm
India of today is moving towards a digital future with dreams of smart cities, efficient road networks and wider communication channels but
India Inc seems to be dodging or oblivious to the fact that these new dreams require fortification or protection. With the rising threat of cyber security breaches and information leaks, spend on security has become one of the most important heads under a corporate’s yearly budget.
However, a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), shows—though business loss due to information leaks showed an increase of 20%—Indian firms have cut their cyber security spend by 17%.
According to the study, the average cost of a security incident for Indian companies has more than doubled from $194 in 2013 to $414 in 2014 and there has been a 20% increase in the average losses as a consequence. But Indian companies have reduced the average security spending from $4.8 million in 2013 to $4 million in 2014.
The frequency of attacks have also increased imposing financial and non-financial threats to the firms. The annual survey of security, IT and business executives in India found that the total number of security incidents detected was over 1 million this year, which translates to 2,800 attacks per day contributing to rising y-o-y incident cost.
Interestingly, these numbers do not represent the total number of incidents. Many organisations in India continue to be unaware of such attacks, while some others do not report detected incidents for strategic reasons or because the attack is being investigated as a matter of national security. On the global front the numbers are steeper with an average financial loss attributed to cyber security incidents standing at $2.7 million, 34% more than in 2013. A recent study by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies noted that the difficulties in estimating financial impact but stated that the annual cost of cyber crime to the global economy ranges from $375 billion to as much as $575 billion.
“Cyber security is no longer an issue that concerns only IT and security professionals. The impact has extended to the C-suite and boardroom. It is now a persistent business risk. Awareness and concern about such security incidents and threats are a priority for the consumers as well,” said Sivarama Krishnan, executive director and leader—India Cyber Security, Governance Risk and Compliance Services, PwC India. “At the heart of organisational security is the human parameter. Organisations in India need to increase engagement levels with employees to manage this better,” he added.
Cyber attacks are more of a concern for India because there has been increased instances of compromises caused by organised crime. One in five (22%) respondents in India continued…

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty hit new highs  but end flat on profit bookingPrint
BSE Sensex hit new record-high of 28,027.96 and the NSE Nifty touched another peak of 8,383.05, respectively in opening trade today. (Reuters)
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 10, 2014 10:21 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 5:06 pm
After hitting a new record high of 28,027.96 points in early trade as investors cheered Cabinet expansion, the benchmark Sensex today ended just 6 points higher compared to the previous close as investors booked profit across counters.
After opening on a strong footing, the 30-share Sensex surged to hit new lifetime high of 28,027.96, breaching its previous high of 28,010.39 recorded on November 5.
The index soon started losing momentum quickly and briefly slipped into the negative territory in volatile trade to touch a low of 27,764.75. It finally ended 6.10 points higher at 27,874.73.
ITC Ltd, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, Hind Unilever, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, BHEL, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Wipro led the 15 Sensex gainers, while Tata Motors, Tata Steel, TCS, SBI, Sesa Sterlite, RIL, M&M, L&T, ICICI Bank and ONGC were among the 15 losers.
The 50-share NSE Nifty after hitting a new peak of 8,383.05 in early trade, also succumbed to profit-booking. It gave up most of initial gains to touch a low of 8,304.45 before ending at 8,344.25, showing a moderate rise of 7.25 points. The gauge had previous intra-day record high of 8,365.55, touched on November 5.
Market players said sentiment was upbeat on hopes that the government will accelerate economic reforms process after expansion of the Union Cabinet, lifting the Sensex and Nifty to new highs.
Some investors sitting on gains, however, became cautious and booked profits in recent outperformers, dragging down the key indices from record highs, they added.
Sectorally, the BSE FMCG index gained the most by rising 2.81 per cent, followed by consumer durables index 1.00 per cent, power index 0.84 per cent and healthcare index 0.47 per cent.
However, oil & gas index ended in the negative zone with a fall of 1.29 per cent, capital goods index (down 1.01 per cent), banking index (down 0.53 per cent), PSU index (down 0.48 per cent) and auto index (down 0.34 per cent).
A mixed closing at the other Asian markets and a slightly higher opening on the European markets influenced the sentiment, market players said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore on Friday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.

AAI  PHHL to be listed; new draft of civil aviation policy releasedPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 3:29 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 5:26 pm
The state owned helicopter operator, Pawan Hans Helicopter Limited (PHHL) and airport operator, Airports Authority of India (AAI) are to be listed on the stock exchange, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said on Monday. Set up in 1985, PHHL is currently the largest helicopter operator in Asia with a fleet of 47 choppers.
After releasing the draft Civil Aviation policy on Monday, Raju also said that an expert committee would be set up to draw a future road map for Air India, “which will help it achieve its full potential”.
“If a policy existed (during the UPA rule), it was opaque. We want to develop a transparent policy because opaqueness leads itself to allegations. This government wants to work in a transparent manner,” Raju said.
The draft policy, which is now available in the public domain for greater participation from the stakeholders, proposes enhancing regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international travel and transit hubs, create more airports through PPP mode, rationalise jet fuel cost, promote air cargo, Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services and helicopter operations apart from stressing on improving passenger facilitation services.
The Minister said he was hopeful that the draft policy would be finalised by January next year. “It is essential to ensure that Air India, our national carrier, achieves its full potential. An expert committee will be constituted to develop a future roadmap for Air India. AAI will be corporatised, followed by listings in the stock exchanges, in order to improve efficiency and transparency. PHHL will be listed in the stock exchanges with the same objective,” says the new draft policy.
A senior ministry official said no time frame has yet been fixed for by when the two entities will be listed or what percentage of the Government holding in the companies will be shed.
“It will be easier to list PHHL first – within the next six months – as it is already a registered company. We will work with the Department of Disinvestment, the nodal Ministry for divesting stake in PSUs. Mopping up funds is not the prime objective of the exercise in case of both the entities. It will also help bring about greater professionalism in the boards of these two entities,” the official said.
Raju, however, hinted at an eventual divestment of Air India, saying there were several suggestions made by different sections, including those in favour and those against privatisation of the national carrier.
“Some say that privatisation is a solution while others feel it should remain a public entity. Another section says the airline should be managed professionally by professional bodies. All these suggestions have emerged. It is in the country’s interest that it cruises smoothly. We don’t want to open a pandora’s box. We will have to take a conscious decision as it is a delicate matter.”
He said there were several issues as mentioned in the draft policy for which the Cabinet’s approval would be required, including a decision on the five year and 20 aircraft rule (5/20) for allowing domestic airlines continued…

Small investors drive big gains in marketsFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Small investors are known to arrive late to the party. Whether they’re early enough for this bull rally, only time will tell. Meanwhile, they’re certainly making their presence felt in the market — retail turnover as a share of the total cash turnover on the two
bourses, NSE and BSE, surged to a 12-quarter high of 51.04% in the September quarter.
What’s more, many more retail investors want to invest rather than just trade. Data compiled by FE show that in the three months to September 2014, retail investors’ holdings in India’s top traded companies rose for the first time in three quarters with their cumulative ownership of the 494 of the BSE 500 companies to 6.37%.
To be sure, foreign institutional investors have been far more bullish on Indian stocks — their ownership of the universe went up by a more significant 50 basis points to 14.5%. But the reversal in the ownership trends for retail investors — their share had dropped between December 2013 and June 2014 by 30 bps to 6.29% — suggests they’re more confident now.

Those that want to play it safer are opting for the mutual fund route. Retail folios have seen a 4.6% increase in H1FY15, marking the highest rise since March 2009, when industry body Amfi started reporting half-yearly folio data.
Sunil Subramaniam, deputy CEO, Sundaram Mutual Fund, points out that in the September quarter, retail investors pumped in Rs 23,821 crore into equity mutual fund schemes, more than twice seen in the June quarter. “While we have seen keen interest in our micro-fund launches, about 5% of our expanded customer base comprises new clients,” Subramaniam added.
October saw mutual funds buying close to Rs 6,000 crore worth of equities, continuing their buying for the sixth straight month. B Gopakumar, head, broking, Kotak Securities, said client acquisitions are up threefold in the last five months. “Nearly 50% to 60% of these clients are maiden investors although some may have bought mutual funds earlier,” Gopakumar said.
The higher retail participation has prompted many to believe that household savings in shares and debentures could go up meaningfully. JPMorgan wrote in a recent report that earlier phases of broad-based momentum in equities have resulted in as much as 12-14% of household financial savings flowing into share and debentures. Based on the current year’s GDP and household savings break-up — 32% financials, 68% physical — the peak allocation rate would amount to flows of $17 billion into shares and debentures, the brokerage observed.
Given how assets such as gold have been under-performing, it’s possible, say experts, that flows into stocks and bonds could increase significantly. In 2014 so far, the price of gold has dropped by nearly 11% to around Rs 25,887/10 grams, which is near its one-and-a-half year low. The BSE Sensex, on the other hand, has gained 31.64% with mid-caps, typically preferred by retail investors, clocking gains of over 43%.
The average retail cash turnover in September quarter stood at Rs 10,189 crore, with the cash turnover at Rs 19,970 crore. NSE, which registers the bulk of cash volumes, in an email response said the share of retail turnover to the total cash turnover on the exchange has risen to 49.21% in April-October, 2014, up from 42.51% in April-October, 2013. Meanwhile, new client registrations on the exchange are on the rise. About 6.51 lakh new clients were registered on the exchange in September quarter, 40% higher year-on-year.

Govt sets ball rolling for its first full Budget; black money to be key focusThe finance ministry has already begun initial work on the annual financial exercise.
Written by Surabhi | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:22 am
The government has begun working on the blueprint for its first full-fledged Union Budget early next year, which includes steps for curbing black money and encouraging voluntary disclosure, a definite time frame for the roll out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), measures to trim the fiscal deficit and incentives for the MSME and manufacturing sector that would help boost growth.
“There has been some discourse on what should be included in the Budget and reviving growth and curbing deficit are key priorities. Another top focus area is likely to be the issue of black money and how it can be curbed, but it is too early right now,” said a person familiar with the development, adding that the Budget may also include some announcement on voluntary disclosure of unaccounted income.
The finance ministry has already begun initial work on the annual financial exercise with discussions on the revised estimates for 2014-15 and the Budget estimates for 2015-16 but a final shape on policy announcements would be made closer to the Budget presentation in February next year.
But finance ministry officials are hopeful that the model and timeline of the GST would be worked out by then and a formal announcement on its roll out can be included in the next Budget.
“It is on top of the agenda and we are hopeful of a consensus on the GST by then,” said an official.
However, the other tax reform — the proposed Direct Taxes Code — is unlikely to be taken up at present by the government. “It is on the back burner right now. Even when the BJP was in the Opposition, it was not in favour of the proposed Code. So it will have to be reviewed again,” said the first source.
The Union Budget 2015-16 is, however, expected to continue with the thrust on fiscal consolidation by focussing on trimming of subsidies as well as higher efficiency in government expenditure.
The first report of the Expenditure Management Commission is also expected by then and will provide key inputs for curbing the deficit.
The report of the Fourteenth Finance Commission will also be another key input for the Budget on not only devolution of taxes between the Centre and the states but also on fiscal consolidation. The commission, led by former RBI governor YV Reddy, is expected to submit its report by December.
Meanwhile, continuing with its focus on reviving economic growth, the Budget is also likely to include more measures for manufacturing, in particular micro, small and medium enterprises. “The basic idea is to carry on with the measures that have been started by the NDA government in this sector to boost manufacturing growth that in turn would revive the economy and create jobs,” said the person.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in September this year unveiled the ‘Make in continued…

To boost social spend  better movement of money needed: Jayant SinhaSinha says that with a stable mandate for this government, these are strong support bases on which to build the Budget numbers.
Written by Subhomoy Bhattacharjee | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 1:28 am
India’s social sector expenditure is too low by global standards, says newly appointed minister of state for finance, Jayant Sinha. According to him this makes it more necessary to spend the money well.
He says this, too, will be the focus of the government going ahead, with more measures like modified direct benefit transfer to make the money travel well. “We are looking for out of the box radical ways and you will see some of those, soon.” As an example, he points to the government picking up Aadhaar despite that being started by the previous UPA government. Another example he is proud of is the rapid approval given by the Modi government for a set of vaccinations for children. Those didn’t cost money, but were significant interventions which were pending for a long time, the former McKinsey employee adds.
In an interview with The Indian Express before taking over his new assignment, the Lok Sabha MP from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand — one of the poorest state — puts a lot of emphasis on the social sector spend. “Of course from the budgetary perspective there is a strong case to keep a tab on mounting expenditure but we don’t intend to cut social sector spending to reach there.” The best way, according to him, would be to push growth so there is surplus to put in the social sector envelopes. “Ours is not a consumption-led inflation story but that of investment-led growth.”
He says that the government was aware of the pressure points like the power dues for the state electricity boards and the recapitalisation of the public sector banks, which would put the fiscal deficit under pressure. “But there are two safety valves,” he says, pointing out these are the disinvestment receipts the proceeds from which he thinks could be massive including SUUTI.
The other is the uptick in foreign investment flows. They have a concomitant impact on tax revenues. A good percentage of the money, he says is coming in as debt which is an indication that foreigners are sound about the revival of the Indian growth story.
Sinha says that with a stable mandate for this government, these are strong support bases on which to build the Budget numbers. The finance ministry has already begun the Budget exercise.
“Give us time to clear up the pending issues that have been hanging fire for a long time, like the Insurance Bill. Remember it was the NDA government in 1999 (under his father, finance minister Yashwant Sinha) which brought in the Bill to raise the composite FDI cap to 49 per cent. We hadn’t moved much on it since then till this government came to power,” he adds.

Inflation in India seen cooling further in Oct  may not budge RBINarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Indian inflation is expected to slow to a record-low in October, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, a Reuters poll showed, probably intensifying calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India.
The survey of 27 economists and analysts predicted consumer price inflation (CPI), scheduled for release on Wednesday, cooled to an annual 5.80 percent in October.
If the forecast is met, it will be even lower than September’s 6.46 percent and the slowest pace of price rises since retail inflation numbers were first published in January 2012.
It would also make the RBI’s inflation targets – 8 percent by January 2015 and 6 percent a year later – appear more attainable.
Wholesale price inflation is forecast to ease to a near five-year low of 2.20 percent in October from September’s 2.38 percent, the Reuters poll showed. This data will be released on Friday.
The recent slowdown in inflation has largely been due to falls in local food prices, which account for 50 percent of the CPI basket, and Capital Economics’ India economist Shilan Shah said it could still go lower.
“Over the coming months, we suspect that both measures of inflation will remain subdued by past standards,” Shah said.
The poll also predicted industrial production to have increased a meager 0.6 percent in September, albeit better than August’s 0.4 percent.
A poor factory output number on Wednesday will imply Asia’s third-largest economy may struggle to maintain a recent pickup in growth.
“Monetary loosening could come onto the agenda sooner than most seem to expect,” Shah said.
He said the RBI could cut its benchmark repo rate by 100 basis points to 7.00 percent over the next 12 to 18 months.
However, some say the RBI may not want to release the monetary policy brakes in a hurry.
“These releases will point to slowing industrial activity alongside slippery inflation – a combination that will add to the growing chorus for rate cuts in December,” said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS.
“But the RBI is unlikely to oblige.”
It will wait for more clarity on inflation and rates could stay unchanged until March, after the government releases its budget, Rao added.
A Reuters poll last month showed economists expect the RBI to keep its key repo rate steady at 8.0 percent well into next year, as it remains wary of a sudden surge in inflation due to a spike in food and oil prices.

Judge toughens jail sentences in Kabul Bank scandal  freezes Karzai brother s assetsThe case also involved Mahmoud Karzai, the brother of Ghani's predecessor president Hamid Karzai.
By: Reuters | Kabul | Posted: November 12, 2014 1:03 am
An Afghan judge tripled the jail sentences of two former heads of Kabul Bank to 15 years on Tuesday at the end of a re-opened court case into the bank’s collapse, which followed allegations of fraud and triggered a financial crisis.
Afghanistan’s new President Ashraf Ghani announced on October 1 that he would re-open the inquiry into the theft of almost $1 billion from the bank in 2010, fulfilling a campaign promise to make fighting corruption a priority.
The case also involved Mahmoud Karzai, the brother of Ghani’s predecessor president Hamid Karzai. Mahmoud Karzai, a shareholder in the bank, has so far been spared jail but the judge on Tuesday ordered that his assets be frozen, along with those of others, until all the funds stolen from the bank have been returned. They face prosecution if the funds are not repaid.
The Afghan government was forced to bail out the country’s then biggest bank after a run on deposits in 2010. It was later re-launched as the state-run New Kabul Bank, but confidence in the banking sector has yet to fully recover.
Only about a third of the $935 million stolen has been recovered, according to the receivers.
The two former heads of the bank, founder Sher Khan Fernod and former Chief Executive Haji Khalil Ferozi, had been convicted in the initial inquiry of taking $810 million of the stolen money and were both sentenced to jail for five years. Their jail terms were tripled on Tuesday.
“The court sentences you both, Sher Khan Fernod and Haji Khalil Ferozi to terms of 15 years in jail for embezzlement and money laundering of the Kabul Bank money,” the judge, Mehrajuddin Hamidi, said, adding that they could appeal against the verdict.
Foreign donors, whom the Afghan government relies on to pay its bills, have welcomed Ghani’s decision to re-open the inquiry. The Afghan Attorney General’s office had criticised the initial sentences as too lenient for the amount of money stolen.
Mahmoud Karzai was spared a jail sentence after the initial inquiry, conducted when his brother was still president, thanks to a presidential decree that granted immunity from prosecution to those who returned funds.
However, while Karzai said he had returned funds that he owed the bank, Afghanistan’s anti-corruption watchdog said last month that Karzai was among 19 individuals and companies that still owed the bank a total of $633 million.
“Their properties are to be identified and frozen. If they do not return the money, they will be prosecuted,” Judge Hamidi said on Tuesday.
Karzai was listed by the watchdog as having owed $22.2 million in loans from the bank and having paid back only $13.4 million.
He has denied that he still owes money and said last month that he had paid back all his loans with interest and had done no wrong.
On Tuesday, Karzai continued…

A blueprint to make Marathi globalMaharashtra policy seeks 50 pc job quota in MNCs for Marathi-speaking people. (Source: maharashtra.gov.in)
Written by Prasad Joshi | Prasad Joshi | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:46 am
Appointment of special officers to ensure use of “correct” Marathi on TV channels, penal provisions for bureaucrats and institutions if they do not use Marathi in official work, Marathi menu cards in hotels and restaurants and 50 per cent reservation in MNC jobs for
Marathi-speaking population are some of the recommendations that have found place in the draft of Marathi language policy of Maharashtra government for next 25 years.
The draft is open for public feedback till December 15. It was recently put up on state government’s website, www.maharashtra.gov.in
A multi-member expert panel led by writer and academician Nagnath Kotapalle has framed the policy, which also recommends higher education in Marathi medium and availability of Marathi-compatible computers.
The draft also observes that the government machinery and judiciary do not use Marathi in day-to-day working despite a formal resolve to this effect. It stresses that the use of Marathi is almost nowhere in financial institutions as well as industry.
Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers’ Association, said menu cards and bills in Marathi would pose problem to customers visiting establishments in multi-lingual areas such as Koregaon Park and Camp in the city. “We will have to print new menu cards, which will be an extra cost burden. Otherwise, we do not think there will be a major problem,” he said.
Panel head Kotapalle said all recommendations made in the draft policy were feasible and could be practically implemented.
“Our attitude to see realistic things as unrealistic when it comes to conservation and promotion of Marathi language is the real barrier. The state government plays the role of facilitator as well as regulator even for the private sector. Therefore, it can easily implement all the recommendations,” he said.
The policy, spelling out its objectives to be achieved in a time-bound manner, envisages stability and support for Marathi language on different fronts during the next 25 years by developing a liking for the regional language and making it a global language.

BSE places 54 firms on dissemination boardBSE places 54 firms on dissemination board
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 12:  
To safeguard the interests of investors of firms listed solely on exiting stock exchanges, the Bombay Stock Exchange has placed as many as 54 firms listed on the Bangalore Stock Exchange and OTC Exchange of India to the dissemination doard (DB).
The move, which is effective today, would allow buyers and sellers of the securities of these companies to disseminate their bids/offers using the services of trading members on the BSE.
Dissemination board
In separate notices, BSE said it is placing 34 companies exclusively listed on the OTC Exchange as well as 20 firms on the Bangalore Stock Exchange on its dissemination board.
Of these, six entities — C F Technologies, Essemm Information Systems, Krisn Information Technologies, Scarlet Flowers & Agritech, Thungabadra Pulps & Boards Mills and Union Home Products — listed on the Bangalore Stock Exchange are “vanishing companies”, BSE said.
Some of the firms on OTC Exchange which have been moved are Zim Laboratories, Allied Stock Investors, Aditya Coating, Electronica Industries, Cherry Polypack and Hindustan Biotech.
Disseminating mechanism
BSE dissemination board is an information disseminating mechanism made available on the bourse’s Web site for buyers and sellers of companies that are listed exclusively on exiting or de-recognised Regional Stock Exchanges (RSEs) and have failed to obtain listing on any RSE.
The board is required to be set up by stock exchanges having nationwide trading terminals such as BSE.
“Trading members are requested to note that the companies admitted to BSE Dissemination Board are not listed with BSE (are treated as unlisted companies),” BSE said.
“There will be no listing agreement executed by BSE with these companies,” it added.
The exchange also said that there would be no monitoring of any compliance with respect to filings made by these firms and that information received from them would be disseminated on the DB platform.
Under the BSE dissemination board, brokers of the exchange would act as “point of contact” for registered client, for executing the bid/offers placed.
Under the mechanism, there is no matching of trades on the board and they are cleared and settled outside BSE/Indian Clearing Corporation.
Investors, on their part, also do not have any recourse to the investor grievance redressal mechanism, including arbitration and investor protection fund.
As per SEBI norms, firms listed exclusively on exiting or de-recognised RSEs are required to seek listing on at least any other RSE that is not seeking de-recognition and exit.
However, those companies which fail to list on any other RSE are treated as unlisted entity and have to be moved to the dissemination board.

Minister stresses on building international airport in NCRMinister stresses on building international airport in NCR
Ashwini Phadnis
Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Aviation
New Delhi, Nov 12:  
The newly appointed Minister of State for Civil Aviation has indicated that the Government will look to change the existing rule of a second airport not being allowed within 150 km from an existing airport.
Speaking to media after taking charge, Mahesh Sharma said that there is a need to have an international airport in the National Capital Region.
"The new airport project in Jewar in Noida is an important project. The project has to be discussed in the wider interest of the nation. This airport is not a project of Mayawati or Mualayam Singh but of India."
The proposal for a new international airport was first mooted by Rajnath Singh in 2001. The coming up of new airport will be against the existing policy as it is less than 150 km from the airport in Delhi.
Sharma said over 2,378 acres have been acquired for the airport in Jewar and there is more land available if needed. Mahesh added that the proposal for a new airport in Jewar will be discussed within the Ministry, and the Prime Minister before it moves forward.
He pointed out that the infrastructure in Delhi is not able to cope and thus a new airport close to the capital will help in this regard.
Airport director shifted
Addressing the media, the Union Civil Aviation Minister, Gajapathi Raju, said that the airport director in Surat had been shifted out following a buffalo hitting a SpiceJet aircraft taxing for take off on a flight to Delhi. The aircraft had over 140 passengers. The Minister said the shifting of the airport director was not a punishment.

Gold holds gains; investors wary of rallies as dollar firms upGold holds gains; investors wary of rallies as dollar firms up
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore, Nov 12:  
Gold held overnight gains on Wednesday, but could struggle to sustain rallies with the US dollar close to four-year highs and outflows from bullion funds showing no signs of abating.
Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s top gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.12 percent to 724.46 tonnes on Tuesday — a fresh six-year low. ‘
This is the fund’s sixth straight day of outflows and shows investor sentiment is bearish. The ETF is seen as a good reflection of market sentiment due to the size of its holdings.
“I see no reason for gold to rally with the dollar and equities so strong and an interest rate hike on the horizon,’ said a precious metals trader in Hong Kong.
“Gold is extremely sensitive to dollar-yen moves now and it should return to the downtrend soon.’’
Spot gold
Spot gold edged up 0.3 per cent to $1,168.30 an ounce by 0718 GMT, after gaining 1.2 per cent on Tuesday from a softer dollar.
The metal has been unable to make a convincing break from a 4-1/2 year low of $1,131.85 reached last weak and there is a strong resistance around $1,180 — the key technical level below which gold has been sold-off since Oct. 31.
“Gold appears stuck in a tight $1,131-$1,181 trading range and is likely to remain weak,’’ said HSBC analyst James Steel.
Alternative investment
Bullion is seen as an alternative investment to riskier assets such as equities during economic uncertainties. But optimism over the US economic recovery has boosted stocks and the dollar. The greenback is also getting a leg-up from a weaker yen, which is at a seven-year low against the dollar.
The Federal Reserve is also expected to raise interest rates sooner rather than later due to the recovery. The move is likely to add more pressure on gold, a non-interest-bearing asset. Gold producers are feeling the pinch of lower prices.
South Africa’s AngloGold Ashanti said it plans staff cuts through voluntary severances. Physical demand has shown signs of picking up.
Premiums in top consumer China were trading in a $2-$3 per ounce range over the global benchmark. Last week, Chinese prices were largely at a discount.

Sensex jumps 130 points to 28 040 on sustained FII inflowsSensex jumps 99 points to 28,009 on sustained capital inflows
Our Bureau/Agencies

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by nearly 99 points at 28,008.90 on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors despite weak global cues.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty ended higher by 20.65 points at 8,383.30.
Among BSE sectoral indices, auto and banking indices were the star-performers and were up 1.18 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.37 per cent, followed by metal 0.9 per cent, PSU 0.57 per cent and capital goods 0.53 per cent.
Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and ITC were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel, NTPC and L&T.
The benchmark BSE Sensex surged 203.97 points or 0.73 per cent to trade at a new record-high of 28,114.03 in the morning session, breaking its previous peak of 28,027.96 reached on November 10.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade and hit a new life-time high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-share NSE index crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points or 0.53 per cent to trade at a life-time high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said that the domestic sentiment remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed the trading sentiment, they added.
A report by Equentis Capital said: "We expect markets likely to remain positive. Stay cautious and book profits on higher levels. The government will unveil IIP data for September 2014 and annual rate of inflation based on the combined consumer price indices (CPI) for urban and rural India for October 2014 on 12 November 2014. Inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for October 2014 will be released on 14 November 2014. Slower inflation could support regulators (RBI) to increase liquidity in the market in short-term and positive action by the regulators will be good for interest sensitive sectors/stocks."
European stocks
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS , Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Asian shares
Asian stocks extended their gains for the fourth day as Japanese shares climbed after the yen depreciated to a seven-year low amid speculation the nation will delay raising its sales tax again.
Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Nikkei 225 rose 73 points or 0.43 per cent at 17,197 and Hang Seng jumped 184.08 points or 0.77 per cent at 23,992.36.

UK Deputy PM Nick Clegg attributes South Asia growth to  Modi dividendNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
UK’s Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has attributed South Asia’s projected growth momentum this year to the “Modi dividend”, citing the Indian Prime Minister’s initiatives for boosting investment and jobs.
The UK’s coalition leader quoted recent World Bank figures, which forecast South Asia to grow by over 6 per cent this year, making it the second-fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific region.
“A huge amount of this momentum is being driven by what the World Bank calls the Modi dividend,” Clegg said in his address at the annual dinner event organised by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Asian Business Association (ABA) here last evening.
“Prime Minister Modi has made boosting investment, jobs and growth a priority for his Government and, when I met with him in the summer, we discussed the critical role Britain could play in helping India realise its ambitions,” he added.
The Liberal Democrat leader also stressed on the important contribution made by Asian businesses to the British economy.
“There are an estimated 300,000 ethnic-minority led SMEs [small and medium enterprises] in the UK, contributing around 30 billion British Pounds to the UK economy every year.
“You are wealth creators in every sense of the word,” he said, adding, his party stands for an economy that is open to immigration.
“I have been clear about my concerns regarding the way in which the debates over immigration and Europe in this country are moving. There are critical issues to address… but, more than ever, responsible politicians and businesses need to defend Britain’s status as an open economy,” he said.
The ABA was set up in 1995 to provide a voice for London’s Asian origin business community, which brings in approximately 60 billion British Pounds to the UK economy every year and accounts for nearly 13 per cent of the city’s annual turnover.
“We with the London Chamber of Commerce will continue to campaign for a freeze, and gradual reduction, in air passenger duty (APD) to put us on a level playing field with our competitors and European partners,” said ABA chairman Vijay Goel, in reference to a surcharge on air passengers from the UK.
“As an island economy dependent on air links, the UK should encourage, rather than penalise activity like air travel that connects people and markets enabling greater trade,” he added.
The leading NRI lawyer also wowed to continue to campaign for a liberalised immigration policy to secure a “practical policy that facilitates the passage of the highly skilled workers that London needs”.
“In a similar vein, we will lobby for changes to the UK visa regime to ensure that genuine businessmen and women – the very life-blood of the capital’s economy – can swiftly enter the UK to do business without enduring bureaucratic delays in processing or lengthy queues upon arrival at London airports,” Goel said.

Govt will soon meet  uphill tasks  of raising share of manufacturing in GDP: Arun JaitleyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
The government plans to address labour issues, infrastructure deficit and high cost of capital soon to meet the “uphill tasks” of raising share of manufacturing in GDP from 15 to 25 per cent, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said here today.
“I still find in merchandise products, our cost of capital, or labour regime, our infrastructure, the improvements which are required in our trade facilitation– these still have to be assisted in order to bring down the prices of our manufactured products,” he said.
“And as part of ‘Make in India’ campaign these are special areas which we will have to address and address very soon. We are in the process of doing so,” he said.
India is endeavouring to become a global manufacturing hub, he said at an event organised by Ministry of Commerce.
Noting that the real job creation is in the manufacturing sector, he said: “That’s why one of our national challenges is that 15 per cent odd share of manufacturing today has to be increased to 25 per cent. But that’s an uphill task and therefore that leaves us essentially with the services sector whose growth is a low hanging fruit in India.”
Services sector is an areas where there is huge space to grow and India has potential to grow, he said.
“I have lurking suspicion that services sector would occupy about 60 per cent of the GDP space… this is one sector where governmental interference is minimal,” he said.
The second aspect is that India has proved to be a competent services provider globally.
“Our success in IT and ITes are well known… Several US Presidents have tried to impose restrictive regimes on outsourced services to save jobs in the US.
“But that indirectly translated in simple languages means that you are compelling the US consumers to buy costlier services from within their own country when the same service is available almost in same real time at a fraction of that cost outside. This rules have substantially not succeeded,” he said.
Talking about sunrise sector, the Finance Minister said, India is beginning to create impact in pharma sector.
The other sectors which have potential for growth are health care, Research and Development, tourism and education.
“I think these are areas we need to be aggressive on,” he added.

Rose Valley scam much bigger than Saradha  saysEDBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:19 pm
The mobilisation of money from the market is much more in Rose Valley firm than in the Saradha ponzi firms, Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the money laundering aspects of both the firms, said here.
“The Rose Valley scam is of much bigger magnitude than the Saradha. It is probably six times bigger as Rose Valley had collected deposits of around Rs 15,000 crore from the public”, a source in the directorate said.
To track the money trail of Rose Valley, ED had already frozen around 2500-odd accounts of the firm.
While money can be deposited in those accounts, no amount can be withdrawn from them, the source said.
The source said that public attention was much more in Saradha as it turned out to be a high profile one. The CBI had also been directed to probe the Saradha scam which the agency was doing now along with the ED.
Tracking the accounts of these two firms was a humongous task as each account was having several branch accounts.
“For instance, we have unearthed so far ten lakh accounts for the Saradha group. There could be more which is yet to be ascertained”, the source said.
Relating to Saradha probe, which ED started from April 2013, the source said that identification of substantial part of ‘crime proceeds’ was over.
“We will be able to file the charge sheet once the predicate offence was established by CBI”, the source said.

Ghost city Nay Pyi Taw is Myanmars showpiece atASEANPrint

Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:18 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 3:26 pm
The 25th ASEAN Summit that got underway in Myanmar’s capital on Wednesday is being termed a historic moment for the bloc of 10 nations, with its secretary-general Le Luong Minh terming it “the most important turning year deciding the achievement of the Asean Community”. One of the key reasons why the ASEAN and East Asia Summits and the related meetings are relevant is because there is barely a year to go before the member states launch an ASEAN Community, including the Asean Economic Community that aims for greater economic integration and freer movement of resources.
Myanmar has deployed an estimated 20,000 police personnel to secure the Summit, according to official estimates released in the run-up to the event. The ASEAN Summit is happening at the Myanmar International Convention Centre in Nay Pyi Taw, where a number of foreign leaders are coming in for the summit and the East Asia summit the following day, to be attended by 16 regional countries as well as Russia and the United States. Apart from the regular restrictions at entry points, passengers on highway buses are being thoroughly checked.
Myanmar is the rotating chair of ASEAN this year for the first time after joining the group in July 1997. The security cordon around the capital is so tight that about 20 per cent of Myanmar Police Force is now deployed in ensuring security in Nay Pyi Taw. The authorities have already designated Myanmar International Convention Centre-MICC1 and the State’s guest houses, the venues of the summit, as limited zones in Nay Pyi Taw.
In terms of sheer planning and execution of a Greenfield project, Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw would put any Indian city to shame. Ridiculed sometimes as the ‘ghost capital’, the capital city has a short history, having been founded on a malaria-infested shrubland, 3 kilometres west of the country’s logging town and sugarcane refinery center of Pyinmana, and approximately 320 kilometres north of the previous capital of Yangon.
Construction started in 2002 and the administrative capital was officially moved to the militarised
greenfield site on November 6, 2005. Nay Pyi Taw is generally translated as “royal capital”or the “seat of the king”, the name literally means “royal city of the sun” in Burmese.
The city is organised into a number of zones. The residential areas are segregated and organized, with apartments allotted according to rank and marital status. The roofs of apartment buildings are color-coded by the jobs of their residents. But many of the city’s residents, however, live in slums on the outskirts.
Then there’s a military zone, where military officers live in a restricted zone away from regular government employees in a complex continued…

BJP no longer a North Indian party in Tamil Nadu: P MuralidharRaoPrint
Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:01 pm
Setting an ambitious target of winning more than 122 seats in the next assembly elections in 2016, senior BJP leader P Muralidhar Rao said BJP will occupy the political vacuum in Tamil Nadu. Observing the state politics and its transitional phase, Rao said people in the state are now feeling suffocated under the rule of DMK and AIADMK.
At a time when top leaders of both parties are caught up in major scams and charges of corruption, he said, BJP will take up the role of opposition in Tamil Nadu, from Kanyakumari to Chennai. “We are no longer a North Indian party here. Unlike UPA, we fight for the cause of Tamil fishermen and the rights of Sri Lankan Tamils too. Major challenge before us is to expand the party and we are already successful in that effort under the leadership of new state chief Tamilisai Soundararajan,” Rao said, referring her to the most powerful state women chief after Vasundhara Raje.
Rao is in the city as part of the party general council meeting being held here.

(The Liberal Democrat leader…)
LONDON: UK's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has attributed South Asia's projected growth momentum this year to the "Modi dividend", citing the Indian Prime Minister's initiatives for boosting investment and jobs.
The UK's coalition leader quoted recent World Bank figures, which forecast South Asia to grow by over 6 per cent this year, making it the second-fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific region.
"A huge amount of this momentum is being driven by what the World Bank calls the Modi dividend ," Clegg said in his address at the annual dinner event organised by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Asian Business Association (ABA) here last evening.

MUMBAI: The Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in Maharashtra won the trust vote in the assembly on Wednesday, but the manner of its victory, secured through a controversial voice vote, drew condemnation from both Congress and erstwhile ally Shiv Sena. Both parties accused BJP of "murdering democracy" and described the government as "illegitimate".
Later in the evening, five Congress MLAs were suspended for allegedly attacking Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao. The day's events, some analysts said, cast doubts on the stability of the Fadnavis government.
The voice vote was passed amidst considerable drama. After BJP MLA from Bandra, Ashish Shelar, moved the trust motion, Speaker Haribhau Bagde called for a voice vote and then said the Fadnavis government had won the vote of confidence, even as Shiv Sena and Congress MLAs demanded that the motion be put to vote.
Adding to the confusion during the voice vote, Sena MLAs were demanding that their leader should be appointed the leader of the Opposition. All this happened in a matter of seconds. Speaker Bagde asserted that the confidence vote was conducted as per rules. He claimed that Congress and Sena MLAs had asked for a division (i.e. a vote on the floor of the assembly) too late.
"I asked those who say 'aye', say 'aye', those who say 'no', 'nay'. The Opposition asked for the division of votes only after I had pronounced that the 'ayes' had it. They (Congress and Sena) asked a little late. They should have asked (for a vote) at the very moment I said 'the ayes have it'," Bagde said.
Later in the evening, Fadnavis asserted that he had a majority and challenged the Opposition parties to move a vote of no-confidence. BJP has 121 MLAs and needed 145 to prove its majority. The Sharad Pawar-headed NCP, with 44 MLAs, is supporting the government from outside.
Enraged Congress and Sena leaders slammed the Speaker's move. "A confidence motion has never been passed by a voice vote. It's a black day for the democratic process in Maharashtra. This government is illegitimate until it proves its majority in the House by a division of votes," said Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan. The former CM said the BJP government should face a trust vote again and that Congress would meet the governor on the issue. Sena has 63 MLAs and Congress 41.
"This is a black day for Maharashtra. The people of the state have a right to know by how many votes BJP won and who voted for it," said Sena leader Ramdas Kadam. He claimed BJP resorted to a voice vote because it was not sure whether its own MLAs would vote for it as they didn't want Fadnavis as the chief minister. Political experts and lawyers were divided on the Speaker's move. Senior advocate MV Kini said a voice vote is not illegal. "Some manipulations may have been done.
However BJP is the single-largest party. Voice vote is an accepted form of expressing solidarity, it cannot be challenged as it is not illegal." Others were critical.
"Devendra Fadnavis is known as a promising man and otherwise a man of integrity, but his government has started by playing a fraud on parliamentary democracy. It is quite unfortunate and was easily avoidable. The people of Maharashtra have a right to know exactly how many MLAs were supporting the new Fadnavis government," said journalist and political analyst Pratap Thorat.
He added that he didn't see the Fadnavis government functioning for more than two years.
Senior advocate IG Khandelwal said he would file a PIL against the manner in which the trust vote was conducted. "It is totally unconstitutional and (an) abuse of the democractic process of the country. This is not acceptable, I am not in the city right now, but as soon as I return, I will be a filing a PIL against the way the trust vote was conducted."

Rose Valley scam much bigger than Saradha: EDEnforcement Directorate
(Relating to Saradha probe,…)
KOLKATA: The mobilisation of money from the market is much more in Rose Valley firm than in the Saradha ponzi firms , Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the money laundering aspects of both the firms, said here.
"The Rose Valley scam is of much bigger magnitude than the Saradha. It is probably six times bigger as Rose Valley had collected deposits of around Rs 15,000 crore from the public", a source in the directorate told PTI.
To track the money trail of Rose Valley, ED had already frozen around 2500-odd accounts of the firm.
While money can be deposited in those accounts, no amount can be withdrawn from them, the source said.
The source said that public attention was much more in Saradha as it turned out to be a high profile one. The CBI had also been directed to probe the Saradha scam which the agency was doing now along with the ED.
Tracking the accounts of these two firms was a humongous task as each account was having several branch accounts.
"For instance, we have unearthed so far ten lakh accounts for the Saradha group. There could be more which is yet to be ascertained", the source said.
Relating to Saradha probe , which ED started from April 2013, the source said that identification of substantial part of `crime proceeds' was over.
"We will be able to file the charge sheet once the predicate offence was established by CBI", the source said.

(US, British and Swiss regulators…)
LONDON/ZURICH: Global regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on five major banks, including UBS, HSBC and Citigroup on Wednesday for failing to stop their traders from trying to manipulate foreign exchange markets.
Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan were also fined over attempts to rig currency benchmarks in a year-long probe that has put the largely unregulated $5 trillion-a-day market on a tighter leash, with dozens of dealers suspended or fired.
Switzerland's UBS swallowed the biggest penalty, despite being the first bank to come forward with evidence of possible misconduct, paying $661 million to Britain's Financial Services Authority (FCA) and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
UBS was ordered by Swiss regulator FINMA, which also said it had found serious misconduct of the bank's employees in precious metals trading, to hand over 134 million Swiss francs.
FINMA also instructed Switzerland's largest bank to automate at least 95 per cent of its global foreign exchange trading and limit bonuses for traders of foreign exchange and precious metals, where it said it had also found evidence of serious misconduct, to 200 per cent of their base salary for two years.
Other UBS high earners will have to get approval for their bonuses to go above that.
Regulators found evidence that traders had colluded to try and manipulate benchmark foreign exchange rates by sharing confidential information about client orders with one another right up until October 2013.
The traders used code names to identify clients without naming them and created online chatrooms with monikers such as "the players", "the 3 musketeers" and "1 team, 1 dream" in which to swap information.
The financial regulator in London, the global hub for foreign exchange (FX) trading, said it had launched a review of the spot FX industry that will require firms to scrutinise their systems and may involve them looking at how they do things in other markets such as derivatives and precious metals.
The FCA's first group settlement, worth more than $1.7 billion, is the biggest in British history and eclipses the 460 million pounds fines for alleged interest rate manipulation, reflecting increasing political and public demands that banks -- blamed for sparking the 2008 credit crisis -- are held accountable.
The five banks earned a 30 per cent discount for agreeing to settle early.
"Today's record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right," the FCA's Chief Executive Martin Wheatley said.
"They must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits or leave the ethics of their conduct to compliance to worry about."
Barclays had been expected to be part of the settlement but the FCA said its investigation into the UK bank was continuing.
"NICE TEAM WORK"
Investors had been braced for a speedy conclusion to the investigation after an earlier, sprawling inquiry into alleged rigging of interest rate benchmarks such as Libor gave regulators experience in how to cooperate globally.
In its settlement with HSBC, the FCA said that after attempts to manipulate one sterling/dollar currency fix that netted a $162,000 profit, traders congratulated one another, saying "nice work gents... I don my hat" and "Hooray nice team work".
  Under instruction from increasingly intrusive regulators, banks did much of the groundwork themselves, handing over reams of online transcripts, clamping down on chatroom use and either suspending or firing more than 30 foreign exchange traders.
FINMA said it has started enforcement proceedings against 11 former and current employees of UBS
With the UK settlement out of the way, the focus shifts to ongoing US and UK criminal investigations and potential civil law suits.
The CFTC, which regulated swaps and futures in the United States, fined the five banks more than $1.4 billion but that does not resolve probes by the US Department of Justice and the New York's Department of Financial Services.
The FCA fines come days before world leaders are expected to sign off on proposals to reform currency markets when they meet at the G20 summit in Brisbane.
The foreign exchange probe proved particularly uncomfortable for British authorities because it cast a shadow over London's credentials as the world centre for foreign exchange trading, and also ensnared the Bank of England whose head Mark Carney is leading global regulatory efforts to overhaul the FX market.
The Bank of England said an internal probe had found no evidence that any of its officials had been involved in unlawful or improper behaviour.
The Bank has fired its chief foreign exchange dealer after it found information about serious misconduct, but said the dismissal was unrelated to a foreign exchange scandal.

Bayer CropScience surges 13% on Q2 showasian markets
(Equity markets in Asia moved…)
TOKYO: Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Equity markets in the rest of Asia moved little after a flat close in a holiday-thinned Wall Street session, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan off just 0.1 per cent in early trade.
Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8 per cent to hit a fresh seven-year high.
The Sankei newspaper, citing unnamed government and coalition officials, said Abe will delay a planned second sales tax increase by a year and a half and take the issue to voters. Abe on Tuesday said he had yet to decide on the timing of an election.
Abe has said he will make up his mind on the tax increase after assessing the July-September GDP data due next Monday, widely expected to highlight the fragility of the rebound following a sharp contraction in the second quarter.
The first increase in the two-stage sale tax hike in April knocked the Japanese economy hard, and markets view a delay in the second-phase of the tax hike as positive for growth.
A snap election could cement Abe's grip on power because opposition parties are too fragmented to win, despite a decline in the prime minister's approval ratings.
"Short-term players are jumping onto this, although in the long run, this just means a delay in fiscal reform and not necessarily positive," said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
Indeed, Japanese government bond prices fell as a delay in the planned tax hike would heighten doubts on whether Tokyo can achieve its fiscal target to balance the budget outside debt payments by 2020.
  The 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield rose to one-month high of 0.515 per cent, up 3.5 basis points from Tuesday close.
However, given massive bond-buying by the Bank of Japan, investors see limited room for further rises in JGB yields.
The yen, which has remained under pressure for nearly two years due to the BOJ's aggressive stimulus, was on the back foot.
The greenback traded at 115.80 yen, having risen to a seven-year high of 116.11 yen on Tuesday.
The dollar lost a bit of steam against other currencies, as investors took profits from its hefty gains in the last few months.
The euro traded at $1.2477, keeping some distance from a two-year low of $1.2358 hit on Friday.
In the energy market, Brent crude futures in London closed down 67 cents on Tuesday, or 0.8 per cent, at $81.67 a barrel after hitting a four-year low of $81.23. US crude fell 0.7 per cent in Asia on Wednesday.
Some analysts said Brent fared worse on Tuesday because of growing expectations that global producer group OPEC will not cut output.

Maharashtra trust vote: BJP govt sails through  Sena fumesThe BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra won a crucial confidence motion on Wednesday through a voice vote that the Shiv Sena described as “strangling democracy” and the Congress called “a black day”.
 
The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member assembly, passed the test to prove its majority through a simple “Aye” from legislators supporting the 13-day-old minority government, though their voice got muffled in the din raised by the Shiv Sena and the Congress.
 
Speaker Haribhau Bagde suspended five Congress legislators for two years after they allegedly heckled governor C Vidyasagar Rao who was injured in the melee as protests inside and outside the assembly turned ugly.
 
The BJP government needed to prove its majority because it was 22 short of the halfway mark in the assembly. Having snapped its 25-year alliance with the Shiv Sena, it didn’t have the 63 MLAs of its former ally to bail it out.
 
Bagde, who was elected unopposed earlier in the day, called the voice vote valid and rejected the opposition’s demand for a poll.
 
“The house should be run as per rules and the Constitution should not be trampled upon. The new government is strangling democracy. We sought division but the trust motion was passed by voice vote,” said opposition leader Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena.
 
The Congress questioned the legitimacy of the trust vote and said it would approach the governor with the request to ask the Fadnavis government to prove its majority by a poll.
 
“This is the darkest day in the history of the Maharashtra assembly. We will not allow the house to function under this minority government,” said former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan.
 
Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam said the BJP government’s act was against the spirit of the Constitution and threatened to take legal recourse. “Vidhan Sabha stands tarnished today. A division would have made it clear whether they have the support of the majority of MLAs. The confidence motion has not been passed.”
 
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Bagde rubbished the opposition’s claims, saying due process was followed.
 
"Congress and Shiv Sena did not ask for a poll (division of votes) at the appropriate time. Since Congress has always been in power it has forgotten the rules about when to ask for division of votes,” Fadnavis told reporters
 
All this while MLAs of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which had committed its support to the Fadnavis government, sat quietly and watched the opposition demand a division. The division of votes, which according to convention is held with legislators voting for or against a motion, was ruled out by the Speaker.
 
The BJP had said it had direct and indirect support of 140 MLAs but needed some legislators to vote for it or abstain in the event of a poll.
 
Since there was no clarity on which way the NCP voted, the speaker’s move was seen as an attempt to save the BJP the embarrassment of publicly going along with Sharad Pawar’s party that has 41 MLAs, sources said.
 
Despite the day’s developments, the BJP indicated in the evening that it was still open to an alliance with the Sena. Fadnavis told HT that he has plans to expand his cabinet before the winter session of the legislature begins in Nagpur on December 8.

BSE Sensex and Nifty rose to record highs today, amid buying in rate-sensitive stocks ahead of the inflation data later in the day.
The Nifty rose above 8400 for the first time, after rising nearly 40 points. It rose to a new high of 8,415. The Sensex gained nearly 200 points to rise to a new high of 28,126.48.
Traders are eyeing industrial production and inflation data to be released after market hours today. According to estimates, IIP rose a modest 0.8 per cent in September while consumer inflation in October fell to 5.67 per cent.
Indian markets have set a series of new highs since the third week of October, aided by strong foreign inflows and government's reform measures.
Foreign institutional investors have pumped in close to Rs 10,213 crore since October 20.
Bank stocks led the gains amid expectations that the RBI could cut rates earlier than expected. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC rose 1 per cent. Another rate-sensitive sector auto also saw buying action. Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp were up over 2 per cent.
Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India Research at UBS Securities, said buying from domestic investors is keeping the market supported. Equity mutual funds saw sixth straight month of inflows in October. This takes the six-month total to Rs 39,000 crore, the largest ever for a six-month period.
Indian markets gave up some gains in afternoon trade. At 2:31 pm, the Sensex was up 71 points while Nifty rose 9 points to 8,372.

Brent Falls Below $81 as Oil Glut Worries Counter Disruption Risks
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 13:31 (IST)
Oil Price Drop Threatens $150 Billion in Investments
Singapore: Brent crude dropped below $81 a barrel on Wednesday, holding just above a four-year low as concerns over a mounting oil glut outweighed geopolitical and supply disruption risks in Ukraine and Libya.
With oil prices having fallen 30 per cent from a mid-June peak, whispering among OPEC delegates ahead of its November 27 meeting is starting to suggest it could informally cut output by around 500,000 barrels a day (bpd).
But delegates within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also warned an agreement will not be easy, and analysts doubt members will take a decisive stance.
"The consensus view is OPEC won't take any action, or if it does, not big enough or sufficiently definitive to have too much impact on prices," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets.
Brent crude for December delivery fell 81 cents to $80.85 a barrel as of 0735 GMT. It dropped 67 cents on Tuesday after first touching $80.46, its lowest since September 2010.
US crude was down 65 cents at $77.29.
Oversupply issues, doubts over whether OPEC would cut production and the strong greenback were weighing on prices in Asia, said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsExpress.
"I would like to think there is a floor at around $80 a barrel ... but I still see more to play out on the downside," he said.
The markets were still assessing if an OPEC cut of 500,000 bpd would make oil prices more vulnerable to the impact of potential supply disruptions caused by geopolitical risks in Libya and other oil producers, Spooner said.
Exports were still blocked at Libya's 120,000 bpd Hariga port by protesters involved in a wages dispute although talks to resolve the issue were underway, an oil official said on Tuesday. The El Sharara oilfield was also still closed.
European Union foreign ministers will meet next week to discuss the possibility of more sanctions on oil and gas producer Russia over the continuing conflict in eastern Ukraine, where there has been renewed heavy shelling.
US oil inventory data due out later Wednesday and Thursday could show a build in crude oil stocks of 800,000 barrels in the week ended November 7, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.

"When the Government expects banks to play a greater role in reaching out to the common masses, it is unfair to deny the legitimate wage revision for the employees and officers. Bank strikes would affect the economy and dislocate banking services," he said, emphasising the need for urgent intervention in this regard.

Big scope for EU  India to cooperate on standards: CravinhoBig scope for EU, India to cooperate on standards: Cravinho

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
The European Union (EU) and India will look to cooperate in the field of standards, said an official from a visiting delegation here on Wednesday.
Ambassador Joao Cravinho, head of EU delegation to India, met Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and said that the challenges posed by standardisation of commodities were similar in both geographies.
"The EU has 28 countries and we need to have equal standards for all. In India the States have different forms of operations and production. The challenge is to standardise it in India and we will now explore how we can cooperate closely on my areas," Cravinho told reporters after the meeting.
No specific commodities had been identified as yet but the Ambassador said the delegation's technical team would begin work immediately on that front.
"We spoke about consumer affairs and it was interesting, particularly the amending of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS Act). There is a lot of opportunity for the EU and India to cooperate on standards," he added.
The Ministry has been focusing on improving the quality of goods being produced domestically and had recently suggested changes to the BIS Act (1986), including the proposal that the number of goods that had to comply with minimum quality standards under the Act be raised from 102 to 2,300.

India to have bigger participation in drug development: J&JSuprotip Ghosh      Follow @suprotip    Last Updated: November 5, 2014  | 15:26 IST
Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman of pharmaceuticals group at Johnson & Johnson (Photo: Rachit Goswami)
Joaquin Duato is Worldwide Chairman of the pharmaceuticals group at Johnson & Johnson and heads the $25 billion Janssen pharmaceutical companies at J&J. On a visit to India, Duato spoke to Suprotip Ghosh about the slew of products his company plans to launch in India and how the changing global model of discovering new drugs would affect India.
Q- Janssen is a large multinational within the folds of Johnson & Johnson, which is a well-known brand in India. But the pharmaceuticals business is not that well-known. What has the going been like in the immediate past?
A- J&J is a diversified health-care company, which has three main sectors - consumer, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Together, we are the largest health-care company in the world. We have a long history and our focus has always been to try and make an impact in health care. Within that context, the opportunity in APAC (Asia Pacific) is that the majority of the population of the world lives here, so our biggest opportunity to make an impact is here. That would also translate in significant business opportunity. So we see APAC as the cornerstone of the future growth of J&J.
Q- Quantifiably, what are these things that'll make up the growth plan?
A- As J&J we have an end-to-end presence in India already. We do R&D in India, we do manufacturing in India and we have distribution and commercialization. Our strategy is to focus globally, in India and everywhere on medical innovation. We focus on several therapeutic areas - cardiovascular, metabolic, oncology, immunology, and infectious diseases, and in these therapeutic areas we have identified maybe particular severe conditions that meet medical needs and we try to solve those difficult problems. So as a consequence, our portfolio may include multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, which is a problem in India with a heavy burden here, so that's the type of medicine we want. It has been 40 years since another medicine was approved in multidrug resistant tuberculosis. So in that sense it is not like the one you described before, we are not looking to buy a local company in order to build our presence. We take a longer-term approach, we invest in R&D to build these differentiated medicines and then we focus on those medicines that we think are going to make a difference. We are less interested in focussing on generics, expanding generics or other areas. We are going to focus on medicines that are unique, that are going to make us special contribution to the country, the population and ultimately also to our business. Now we have a particular window of opportunity because we will be getting approvals for several medicines that are going to address a particular need. These are relevant in India and that could help us accelerate our presence in India. That's part of the reason we are here.
Q- What are your solutions in India when it comes to the price barriers for good medicines?
A- Access and pricing is a complex issue. We need to as an innovation-based company look at the components. One component is to generate access to our patients to which these medicines are intended. Another component is to be able to have a price which is commensurate with the value that particular medicine brings. There are medicines that bring more value than others and there has to be a difference. The third component is that it has to enable the company to invest in innovation, otherwise we are not going to be able to develop new medication. So there are these three components - of value, of reward and of access. Depending on the geography and the type of product, some of these components are more important than others. Specifically, when we are talking about a country like India, we are talking about communicable diseases that are particularly endemic such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, then the component of access within the three components is most important. Then we try to come to a situation in which prices are not a barrier to receiving treatment. In other areas in which that are maybe not communicable diseases, and are not endemic, then we try to have a price which is commensurate with the purchasing power of the country but that still enables us to make a profit. That's the balance we navigate. In general, prices of medicines vary depending on the country, but prices in India are at the lower end.
Q- There are companies such as Cipla which have a completely different approach to HIV, for example?
A- In certain situations, in countries like India we give free licenses to companies like Cipla and others in order to make the drug available. The difference is that we pay for the research whereas Cipla doesn't.
Q- There are multiple challenges in India. One reason why companies such as Abbott bought an Indian company like Piramal is because, among other things, they needed local knowledge. Are you going to go alone in this market?
A- Our management is 100 per cent Indian. We don't manage the company by foreigners, all our management is Indian as you can see. But we recognise that we need to learn from other parties.
Q- The blockbuster drug discovery model seems to be under considerable pressure. Is that also one reason why exploring markets such as India are becoming more important for companies as large as yours?
A- A pharmaceutical company such as J&J has to be in places where there are significant opportunities to make an impact and demographics is an important factor. From that perspective, emerging markets have the most important demographics. We chose an important area for companies like us that address broad populations. So in that sense it's an area where companies like us are going to continue to invest in a disproportionate way thinking more of the long term.
The blockbuster model is over in the sense that if people are thinking that products in that which have very high level of sales, which address very broad medical needs and have a very strong promotional support, I don't think that it is the area companies are going now. More of these opportunities are in the smaller patient populations, as opposed to larger patient populations and as a consequence we are going to see more different medicines that are perhaps of a smaller size, but tailored towards very small patient populations. The way medicine is going to go is to have solutions that address smaller patient segments in a differentiated way. Ultimately the result is going to be the same, but what you call the blockbuster you may have five, six different smaller medicines.
Q- Obviously you need a different model of drug discovery as well. You can't do the same thing you were doing 10 years ago. You'd need people from that population for trials and testing. Does that mean the drug discovery model will bring more importance to countries such as India?
A- In every aspect of the pharmaceuticals industry the emerging markets are going to have a bigger participation, more commensurate with their importance. But it will be gradual. The development time of a medicine from an idea to the product can be 20-25 years. Over time, countries like India will have a bigger participation in drug development. It won't be overnight.
Q- What are the comparative sizes of your operations in China and India?
A- For different reasons, our operations in China are larger.
Q- What are the new medicines that you will launch in India?
A- We are expecting approvals for several medicines. One of them is a medicine for diabetes called Invokana, which works on a new mechanism of action. Diabetes is an opportunity, because it is particularly prevalent in India. We are also in regulatory process for a new medicine called Simponi for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, which is also a big problem and can be debilitating. The company has been here since 1959. We now have this unique opportunity of having a number of new products approved.
Q- Is the Drug Controller General of India approving more products?
A- Now it is actually a matter of our own pipeline. We are able to have this number of new products that are going to be available to be approved and it is unique for us in India. It is a function of our own pipeline. For us India has been a priority market.
Q- Globally, which are the therapeutic areas where we will see major new therapies and drugs coming out in the future?
A- You have seen a surge in the number of medicines being approved globally. In fact, you see the US FDA approving more number of medicines vs. their historical average. So you are seeing some new technologies being used in drug discovery, genomics and proteomics, they are starting to yield a result in terms of new medicines. It has enabled us to understand better the pathways of the diseases and to identify targets that we can affect using medicines. In cancer, for example, there are medications that are prolonging life, for a longer period of time using your own immune system to combat the disease. It is becoming more evident in diabetes, newer approaches. It is becoming evident in immunological diseases in a very effective way. In areas that need improvement, we have massive problems with diseases such as Alzheimer's in need of a solution in which we are investing too.

Gold monetisation scheme will work if donetransparentlyGold futures price falls on global cues
As the debate on monetising household gold stocks rages on to ease pressure on the country’s current account deficit, some are still sceptical about the efficacy of any such plan. However, Rajesh Khosla, managing director at India’s largest refiner, MMTC-PAMP, says any scheme that seeks to put idle stocks to productive use is worth giving a try because if it succeeds in sourcing even 1% of the more than 22,000 tonne of gold lying with households each year, imports would tumble by 20-25%, restoring some trade balance. Referring to his series of interactions with policymakers in recent months, he says the central bank seems to be in favour of such a scheme and the finance ministry has agreed to set up a working group to explore the idea fully, in an interview with FE’s Banikinkar Pattanayak. Excerpts:
What prompts you to believe people will actually invest in any such gold monetisation scheme?
The scheme is aimed at luring people to put their unutilised gold to some productive use. Now, to explore the viability of any such scheme, we commissioned an all-India survey. As many as 60% of respondents say they are ready to park gold if certain conditions are met: the bank must bring down the minimum quantity of gold that can be deposited to, say, 40 gram; it should have a mechanism whereby the purity of gold can be assessed in front of the customer; the customer must earn interest in gold in the form of gold; the interest should be tax-free and finally the customer should have an add-on account for the metal in the bank.
We have had two interactions with the RBI, which seems to be ready to support the scheme. So it’s now the questions of jewellers, banks, RBI coming under the umbrella of the finance ministry and making the scheme a success. What we are asking the ministry is formation of a working group, comprising key stakeholders, including the RBI, and let the group understand the concept and prepare a roadmap. We have been promised by the ministry that a working group would be set up.
How will the scheme work?
A customer who already has a bank account will apply for an add-on account, which will be designated in grams of gold. The banks must be linked to purification-testing centres. All information must be online so that the customer can choose the location of the centre and even a convenient date. On arrival, he will be explained that the gold he would like to deposit will be melted and once it’s done, he can know the exact quantity and purity. The gold will be credited to his metal account. So when you reach a quantity of 50 gram, you will have the option of a fixed deposit, just like the fixed deposit of cash beyond certain levels. Interest on the fixed deposit of gold will depend on the period of investment. Meanwhile, the gold deposited by the customer has come from the verification centre to the refinery and the refiner has converted it into a bar.
What will banks do with the gold deposits?
The banks have to look for people to lend gold to. Every bank has some registered jewellers whom it can approach. Once the scheme is operational, jewellers can apply for gold online and the bank will credit that much to the jeweller’s metal account for a mutually-agreeable period. Once that period is over, the jeweller has to return gold along with interest. So just like the bank collects money through deposits and offers loans to others, the gold loan will function in a similar way.
What will banks do when jewellers don’t want gold, especially in the off-season?
The banks can pledge more gold and less cash with the RBI against their statutory liquidity ratio requirements. This means banks will have more cash in their hands to lend to people at attractive interest rates. But first the banks will give gold to jewellers and if, for some reasons, jewellers don’t want it, they can park it with RBI for the SLR.
Does such a scheme require changes to any of the existing Acts or norms?
No. The country already has a scheme that says the customer has to deposit at least 500 gram, which effectively leaves out 98% of individuals. So the new scheme should take even less than 50 gram of gold to attract millions of Indians, and not just temple trusts or high net-worth individuals. Moreover, the scheme should be made transparent, flexible and hassle-free, just like the fixed deposits in cash. This is going to be a decisive response to the current account deficit problem. Indian households have more than 22,000 tonne of gold and if we manage to grab even 1% of that stock and circulate locally, our gold imports will fall by 20-25% a year.
Which banks are you talking to for adopting this scheme?
At this stage I can’t reveal the names, but we are in advanced stage of discussions with three private-sector banks. They say until the working group is set up, we can settle issues between ourselves. This shows they are quite keen on it.
Recently, a PwC report said India could lose $3 billion in five years due to less import duty on gold dore than on refined gold? As the country’s largest refiner, do you subscribe to the view?
The PwC report is flawed. It says if the entire gold imports of 800 tonne come in the form of dore every year, there will be a revenue loss of $3 billion over five years, assuming there is an almost 2% duty differential between dore and refined gold. Now look at the reality. Total dore production in the world is 3,000 tonne, of which four countries — China, Russia, South Africa and Canada with production of around 900 tonne — mandate that dore has to be refined locally. Now there are 70 refiners in the world who fight for the remaining 2,100 tonne of dore. So to expect that MMTC-PAMP can contract 800 tonne for imports is ridiculous, especially when we are struggling to refine 60-70 tonne a year. Moreover, although the basic customs duty differential is 2% (8% for dore and 10% for refined gold), refining in India also attracts 9% excise duty. So after factoring in everything, including cess and duty credit, the actual duty differential would be just 0.7%.

In Myanmar  PM Modi eyes regional connectivity booster shot for tradeNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off his 11-day foreign tour on Tuesday afternoon with his first stop at Nay Pyi Taw, the capital of Myanmar, where he held bilateral talks with President U Thein Sein.
The focus was on beefing up engagement in the areas of culture and commerce, with the Indian prime minister giving a strong push to improving regional connectivity as a booster to trade and increased people-to-people contact.
Modi landed here in a special aircraft and was given a ceremonial welcome. Tweeting after his bilateral meeting, Modi said that he and President Thein Sein had reviewed the bilateral relationship. “Had a very good meeting with President Thein Sein. We had extensive discussions covering various aspects of our bilateral relations…. We talked about strengthening ties in the fields of culture, commerce & enhancing connectivity.
Had a very good meeting with President Thein Sein. We had extensive discussions covering various aspects of our bilateral relations.
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 11, 2014
On Wednesday, Modi will attend the 12th ASEAN-India summit and the following day, he will take part in the 9th East Asian summit on the first leg of his three-nation foreign tour that will also take him to Australia and Fiji.
This will be the second visit by an Indian PM to Myanmar in one calendar year after Manmohan Singh’s visit there last March for the BIMSTEC Summit. India has undertaken a slew of connectivity, capacity building and development projects in Myanmar. Among the leaders that he is slated to meet is Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
For the official talks, the agenda includes India’s keenness to ensure that the next ASEAN-India five-year plan of action starting 2016 should focus on improving people-to-people contact, ramping-up trade relations and reinforcing the strategic engagement. The plan will also focus on security architecture in the region.
Issues on the anvil at the ASEAN summit meeting include review of an ambitious connectivity project to develop a 3,200-km highway linking India, Myanmar and Thailand that was originally envisaged to be completed by end-2017, and is now expected to be completed in 2018.
India and the 10-nation ASEAN bloc hope to dovetail the connectivity plans with this highway project. Modi in a tweet earlier this week had said that India’s ties with  ASEAN are “deep rooted” and that strengthening relations with the nations in the grouping are an important part of its ‘Act East’ policy.
He said he looked forward to meeting leaders attending the two summits in Myanmar. “ASEAN is central to our dream of an Asian century, where India will play a crucial role. Am sure the meetings there would be fruitful,” Modi had said.
With the bloc’s plan to float an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015, the free trade pact in services and investment signed in September between India and the ASEAN is expected to help bilateral trade climb to $100 billion by 2015, from $71.6 billion in 2012.
Modi is also said to be keen to tap the potential offered by the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit to attract more tourists from southeast Asian nations.
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
The East Asia summit (EAS) is a major forum for leaders in the region and it currently has 18 members. Besides the 10 countries in the ASEAN region and India, the other EAS members are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the US and Russia.
The EAS bloc represents 55 per cent of the world’s population and accounts for around 56 per cent of global GDP.

US sales of Indian drug firms hit by delay in FDA approvalsIndian drug firms see fall in US sales on FDA approval delays

Domestic drug firms expect a slowdown in new generic drug approvals by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to weigh on sales in their largest market for at least two more quarters, due to an ongoing overhaul of the review process.
The domestic pharmaceutical industry , worth US $15 billion, which has been hit by a spate of regulatory sanctions in the past year due to concerns about production processes, supplies about 40 per cent of generic and over-the-counter drugs to the United States.
The FDA implemented the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) programme in October 2012, giving the agency the right to collect fees from manufacturers to expedite the approval for sale of generic drugs.
However, the agency has not made as much progress with clearing the existing backlog of applications for cheap copycat drugs as some domestic manufacturers had hoped, company executives said, which is now beginning to drag on sales in the US markets.
A rise in the number of filings for new generic drugs from the country and elsewhere, and the need to step up inspections of production facilities before giving final approval, is putting pressure on FDA resources, adding to the backlog, analysts said.
While the regulatory agency is hiring more staff and looking to speed up the process, executives of the domestic pharmaceutical industry say the pace of approvals is unlikely to pick up until 2016.
Leading home-grown generic drugmakers Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals in November posted a drop in their second-quarter US sales, blaming the slowdown in the approval process.
"The US has been challenging in this year because of the significant slowdown in product approvals. The remaining half of this financial year will remain challenging for the industry," Glenmark Managing Director Glenn Saldanha told Reuters.
APPROVAL LAG TAKES TOLL
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, the country's largest drugmaker by revenue, and Cipla, both due to report their quarterly results on Thursday, are also expected to be affected by the slowing approvals, analysts said.
While Sun Pharma is expected to report a 17 per cent rise in net profit for the second quarter ended September 30, helped by a pick-up in sales in its home market, Cipla is expected to report a 7 per cent drop in its net profit.
"The (FDA approval) process will be streamlined with a lag, and that lag is still taking a toll on most companies," said Siddhant Khandekar, vice-president of research at brokerage ICICI Securities. "The implementation has already started, but we will probably see normalisation only by 2016," Khandekar added.
FDA spokeswoman Sandy Walsh said the agency was on track with the implementation of the GDUFA and was "maintaining pace with historical performance". The FDA approved 45 new drug applications in August and September 2014 each, which was more than the monthly average for 2012 and 2013, Walsh said.
"We remain committed to utilising all available resources to ensure expeditious and complete (new application) reviews," the spokeswoman added.
By 2017, the FDA aims to bring down the review time to 10 months from about 30 months now. For applications submitted in the year starting October 2014, the FDA has set a target to complete review of 60 per cent within 15 months.
Some home-grown generic drug firms are, however, uncertain about the pace of approvals in the near future.
"Our inventory is lined up in the United States in anticipation of approvals, and we expect them to come in by January, if not December. But it is not in our control," Dr Reddy's Chief Financial Officer Saumen Chakraborty said.

Both sides see India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway an opportunity for industrial cooperation
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Myanmarese President Thein Sein met at Nay Pyi Taw, the capital of this eastern neighbour of India, on Tuesday, the big focus of discussions was improving connectivity between what they called “brother countries.”
The two leaders spoke about the need for more direct air links, as well as an India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway, and the Kaladan multi-modal transport project. The two nations are now not connected by direct flights. They signed an MoU for a bus service between Imphal and Mandalay only this year.
“Both sides see the trilateral highway as an opportunity for industrial cooperation and sought to explore the possibility of setting up industrial parks along the highway. President Thein Sein said that as India grows and develops, Myanmar will also benefit. The possibility of India investing in special economic zones in Myanmar was discussed,” said a press release.

India, Myanmar to raise bilateral trade
Although bilateral trade between India and Myanmar is well below its potential, efforts are being made to enhance it, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin told presspersons on Tuesday.
Bilateral trade stood at less than $2 billion in 2013.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Myanmarese President Thein Sein, at their meeting at Nay Pyi Taw, also discussed other economic ties and cooperation in the oil and gas sector, as well as the need for more cultural contacts, including sending Myanmarese students to Nalanda University.
The meeting was one of more than 20 bilateral ones Mr. Modi is scheduled to have during his 10-day, three-nation tour during which he will attend the ASEAN-India summit, the East Asia Summit and the G-20 and Pacific Island Leaders-India summits.
During the tour, he is expected to engage with leaders of 40 countries.
On Wednesday, Mr. Modi will meet Myanmar democracy icon and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi as well as leaders of Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and Singapore.
He will also attend the ASEAN-India summit with 10 other countries, where a free trade agreement is being discussed. “ASEAN is at the core of our Act East Policy and at the centre of our dream of an Asian century, characterised by cooperation and integration,” Mr. Modi said in a statement earlier.
On Thursday, Mr. Modi will meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang for the first time, in a structured bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the East Asian Summit. The meeting comes nearly two months after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Delhi. They are expected to review progress in ties based on their announcem-ents during the visit.
In particular, sources said, Mr. Modi will speak about India’s concern over “incursions” by the People’s Liberation Army into the Line of Actual Control.

Stage set for IISCO Steel Plant to go on streamUpdated: November 12, 2014 01:05 IST
Stage set for IISCO Steel Plant to go on stream
Indrani Dutta
plant opening
Run-up to lighting of the blast furnace is slated for Nov. 25
The countdown has started for the lighting up of the blast furnace at the IISCO Steel Plant (ISP) of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), raising hopes of commissioning the 2.5 million-tonne per annum steel plant, which faced myriad trials and challenges since its conception in 2006.
Although it is being labelled as an expansion project, it is actually a Greenfield plant, which has come up on 953 acres in Burnpur almost adjacent to where smelting of iron through the blast furnace mode started in 1922. It is still operational.
The history of erstwhile IISCO is the history of the development of iron and steel in India.
After suffering delays of nearly four years caused by many reasons beyond its control (like finding tonnes of steel boulders in the soil), ISP, which was amalgamated with SAIL in 2005, is entering a penultimate phase.
Rs.18,000 cr project
In industry parlance, it is known as “initial start-up towards integrated operation of the steel plant.” This has started with a process called timbering, which began on Monday. This is the run-up to lighting of the blast furnace, which is scheduled for November 25. The project, whose cost is now being estimated at around Rs.18,000 crore, comprises 32 major packages and 47 auxiliary packages with almost all the major names in global steel and civil works being engaged on the job.
“Nearly 25 per cent of the delay was on account of a 300 per cent increase in piling work, necessitated by ‘discovery” of slag and metal boulders beneath the soil,” Executive Director in-charge Ishwar Chandra Sahu said. The additional earthwork also created problems in movement of heavy equipment, which also caused delays.
However, if there were challenges there were also innovations like allowing some of the readied plants to commence production, supplying the output to sister units.
Although majority of the land was with IISCO, it was not as if the project was totally spared of land woes either. A 300-acre acquisition needed for material movement triggered tension as the movement of a village deity was involved. All that may now be kept for posterity to learn lessons in project management.
It has also embarked on a recruitment drive to run the new plant. It is also reportedly progressing with a plan to set up another unit where the original unit now stands.

Dell Services recasts healthcare focusUpdated: November 12, 2014 00:28 IST
Dell Services recasts healthcare focus
Sanjay Vijayakumar
computing and information technology
To focus on mid-segment for IT healthcare
Dell Services is shifting its IT health care focus to mid-segment in India. The mid-segment typically includes 50-100 bed hospital chains, eye care, dental care and other speciality chains.
Dell Services is now starting to focus on the Indian IT healthcare market. As of now, it derives majority of its revenue from healthcare vertical focused on the U.S., the U.K. and Middle East.
According to Veera Raghavan, Executive Director and Global Practice Head for Healthcare and Life Sciences at Dell Services, about 90-100 specialised healthcare chains are coming up in the mid-segment. “If you look at IT spend by hospital segment, it is upwards of 2-2.5 per cent of revenue globally. In India, even 0.5 per cent is considered high. However, we believe the IT spending in healthcare is growing 25 per cent year-on-year,” said Mr. Raghavan.
About eight months ago, Dell Services launched a programme called ‘hospital IT in a box’, which looks to bundle the IT needs — right from ERP to hospital administration system on the cloud — and offer it as a service. The firm has tied up with Ubq Technologies (which provides the hospital information systems solution in the front-end) and Ramco Systems for the ERP on the cloud. Mr. Raghavan said for a 50-bed hospital chain the cost could be Rs.25,000 plus or minus a month.
“We have already tied up with a hospital chain. In the next three months, we will have three hospital chains signed,” he added. Mr. Raghavan is betting on the Indian IT healthcare spending to go up. Healthcare providers in India are expected to spend $1.1 billion on IT products and services in 2014, an increase of 5 percent over 2013, according to research firm Gartner.

Hamid Ansari bats for liberal nationalismPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:06 am
Vice-President Hamid Ansari lauded India’s “pluralist or liberal nationalism” while delivering Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Lecture at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library on Tuesday.
“In the historically altered context of contemporary India, the thrust of this pluralist nationalism is also on the need to readjust state institutions to meet demands of inclusion of marginalised and disadvantaged political groups,” said Ansari during his address on “A century of turmoil in Western Asia:Some pitfalls of Nationalism”.
Ansari also cautioned, “In many instances, militant nationalism became a reflex of despair resulting from economic failures and of unrealised aspirations along with a motivation to resurrect an imaginary past devoid of these shortcomings. From this, slippage into a religio-cultural form of strident nationalism has been found to be easy.”

Shanghai, Nov 12:  
Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said consumers spent a record $9.3 billion during its 24-hour shopping promotion Singles Day, cementing its position as the world’s biggest online retail event.
Shoppers had yesterday spent $3.5 billion or 60 per cent more than the $5.8 billion sales recorded for the same day last year, the group had said in a statement today.
It also dwarfed the major shopping days in the US in terms of transaction value, toppling the combined online sales of $5.3 billion recorded on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday through to Cyber Monday last year, according to data compiled by Internet analytics firm comScore.
Alibaba has been pushing November 11 as Singles Day — so named for the number of ones in the date —since 2009 as it looks to tap an expanding army of Internet shoppers in China, which has the world’s biggest online population.
The day was originally marketed as an “anti-Valentine’s Day” in China, featuring hefty discounts to lure the country’s singletons and price-sensitive buyers.
It was expanded globally this year to include more than 27,000 overseas brands and merchants as well as customers from more than 217 countries and regions.
Deals settled on Alibaba’s China and international retail market places reached $9.3 billion for the day, the group said in the release.
The number of transactions made per minute peaked at 2.85 million, it added.
“We are very happy with the results of this year’s 11.11 shopping festival,” said Alibaba chief executive Jonathan Lu.
“We are particularly encouraged by the growing trend of consumers embracing mobile shopping on a global stage.”
Approximately $4 billion of deals or 42.6 per cent of total were made via mobile devices, according to the company.
Some 278.5 million packages were expected to be shipped after the event, it said.
The strong set of figures came against the backdrop of a growing online retail market in China and increasing spending power of consumers, analysts said.
Nonetheless Alibaba shares, which have risen strongly since its record-breaking $25-billion initial public offering two months ago, dropped 3.87 per cent to $114.54 in New York yesterday.

FM Arun Jaitley signals reforms for manufacturingFM Arun Jaitley signals labour, infra reforms to increase manufacturing
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 14:14 IST
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
The government plans to address labour issues, infrastructure deficit and high cost of capital soon to meet the "uphill tasks" of raising share of manufacturing in gross domestic product (GDP) from 15 to 25 per cent, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in the national capital on Wednesday.
"I still find in merchandise products, our cost of capital, or labour regime, our infrastructure , the improvements which are required in our trade facilitation - these still have to be assisted in order to bring down the prices of our manufactured products," Jaitley said.
"And as part of ' Make in India ' campaign these are special areas which we will have to address and address very soon. We are in the process of doing so," the Finance Minister said.
The country is endeavouring to become a global manufacturing hub, Jaitley said at an event organised by the Ministry of Commerce.
Noting that the real job creation is in the manufacturing sector, the minister said, "That's why one of our national challenges is that 15 per cent odd share of manufacturing today has to be increased to 25 per cent. But that's an uphill task and therefore that leaves us essentially with the services sector whose growth is a low hanging fruit in India."
Services sector is an area where there is huge space to grow and the country has potential to grow, he said.
"I have lurking suspicion that services sector would occupy about 60 per cent of the GDP space ... This is one sector where governmental interference is minimal," he said.
The second aspect is that the country has proved to be a competent services provider globally.
"Our success in IT and IT services are well known... Several US Presidents have tried to impose restrictive regimes on outsourced services to save jobs in the US.
But that indirectly translated in simple language means that you are compelling the US consumers to buy costlier services from within their own country when the same service is available almost in same real time at a fraction of that cost outside. These rules have substantially not succeeded," Jaitley said.
Talking about sunrise sector of the country, the Finance Minister said, pharma sector was beginning to create an impact.
The other sectors which have potential for growth are health care, Research and Development, tourism and education, he added.
"I think these are areas we need to be aggressive on," Jaitley said.

Nifty crosses 8 400-mark ahead of CPI dataMarket update: Sensex ends above 28,000, Nifty touches 8,400-level

The BSE Sensex on Wednesday closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions. It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points.
It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in Tuesday's trade. A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours on Wednesday, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 per cent), Bajaj Auto (2.10 per cent), HDFC Ltd (1.12 per cent), SBI (0.17 per cent), ICICI Bank (1.33 per cent), HDFC Bank (0.44 per cent), ITC (1.55 per cent), Bharti Airtel (0.64 per cent), BHEL (0.88 per cent), Coal India (0.10 per cent), Dr Reddy's (0.58 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 per cent), Tata Motors (1.71 per cent) and TCS (0.55 per cent).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.

Pope urges G20 leaders not to forget the poorPope Francis is silhouetted during a private audience with Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama at the Vatican Nov. 10, 2014. (Source: AP)
By: Agence-France Presse | Brisbane | Posted: November 12, 2014 2:52 pm
Pope Francis has called on G20 leaders not to forget the poor, saying to do so would be “regrettable” as the heads of the world’s most powerful economies prepare to meet in Australia.
The Group of 20 leaders are expected to sign off in Brisbane this weekend on a pledge to boost the level of their combined economic output by at least two percent above the currently projected level in the next five years, creating millions of jobs.
In a letter to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who holds the G20’s rotating presidency, the pope said world powers “must not forget that many lives are at stake behind these political and technical discussions”.
“And it would indeed be regrettable if such discussions were to remain purely on the level of declarations of principle,” he said in the letter, sent on November 6 but only made public today.
“There are far too many women and men suffering from severe malnutrition, a rise in the number of the unemployed, an extremely high percentage of young people without work and an increase in social exclusion which can lead to criminal activity and even the recruitment of terrorists.”
He said he hoped the talks would mark a step towards “eliminating the root causes of terrorism, which has reached proportions hitherto unimaginable; these include poverty, underdevelopment and exclusion.”
“It has become more and more evident that the solution to this grave problem cannot be a purely military one, but must also focus on those who in one way or another encourage terrorist groups through political support.”
The pontiff said he hoped to see “a substantial and productive consensus” on boosting growth and jobs that took into account “real improvements in the living conditions of poorer families and the reduction of all forms of unacceptable inequality”.
Each country is expected to submit its detailed reform plans to achieve the growth goal in Brisbane, with an emphasis on private sector financing to spur infrastructure investment.
In his letter, the pope also warned about the impact on the environment of “unbridled consumerism” while speaking of the “unbearable humanitarian situations around the world”, pointing to the Middle East.

Aurobindo Pharma set to acquire US nutritional supplements maker Natrol for$133Print
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:31 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 4:19 pm
Aurobindo Pharma is all set to acquire troubled US-based nutritional supplement maker, Natrol Inc for USD 132.5 million (over Rs 810 crore) after emerging as the highest bidder for acquisition.
Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc, a subsidiary of the Hyderabad-based firm, has emerged as the highest bidder for acquisition of Natrol Inc and other affiliate entities, under a process to be finally approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
“Under the auction process, Aurobindo USA emerged as the highest and best bidder with a bid of USD 132.5 million to acquire the assets of Natrol with an agreement to take on certain liabilities,” Aurobindo Pharma said in a statement.
The buyout of Natrol would provide the right platform for creating a fully-integrated OTC platform in the US and other international markets, it added.
Natrol, which manufactures and sells nutritional supplements in US and other international markets, provides Aurobindo with strong brand reputation and presence in a variety of attractive supplement markets, it said.
“This acquisition is subject to final approval by the US court and other statutory approvals as may be required, including any termination of the waiting period or approval under the HSR Act, and closing conditions as per the Asset Purchase Agreement,” Aurobindo Pharma said.
Barclays acted as the sole financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as the legal counsel to Aurobindo USA, it added.
Aurobindo Pharma shares were trading at Rs 1,066 apiece on the BSE, up 3.69 per cent from its previous close.

Government provides operational flexibility to oil firmsGovernment provides operational flexibility to oil firms

Cairn India
(Operational flexibility…)
NEW DELHI: In a bid to make it easier to produce oil and gas, the government has notified a set of rules granting operational flexibility to firms like Cairn India and ONGC to start producing from several discoveries that are mired in contractual disputes.
The Petroleum Ministry in a notification relaxed rigid timelines prescribed in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for development and production of oil and gas.
"The Government of India hereby notifies Policy Framework for Relaxations, Extension and Clarifications at the Development and Production Stage under the PSC regime for early monetisation of hydrocarbon discoveries," the order said.
Operational flexibility has been provided in enforcing contracts by way of relaxing some of timelines prescribed for discoveries so that E&P activities do not suffer on account of excessive rigidity in decision making.
The PSC between the government and the explorer has rigid timelines for each stage of exploration and actions have been initiated against firms even if deadlines are missed by a day.
The notification said 3-6 months extension in the current 18-60 month timeframe for submission of declaration of commerciality (DoC) of discoveries, a prerequisite before investment plans can be finalised, can be given.
Also, the deadline for submission of investment plan for the discoveries too would be extended by up to six months.
The PSC provides for time period for submission of field development plan (FDP) for hydrocarbon discovery after DOC. There is no provision in the PSC for extension of this time period and non-acceptance of FDP due to late submission results in non-monetisation of discoveries.
Also, upstream regulator DGH has been given flexibility to accept discoveries for which operators had failed to provide prior notification to the government.
The notification also provided for reduction in committed work programme in case a block or its part is not available for exploration activities consequent to denial of permission by government agencies.
Reduction of minimum work programme (MWP) will be considered in case of "blocks overlapping with Special Economic Zone (SEZ), reserve forest, naval exercise areas, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) danger zones, National Parks, urban areas and firing ranges of police/armed forces," it said.
Currently, discoveries, mostly of Cairn, ONGC and GSPC are stuck because of lack of flexibility in timelines. These include 10 finds of Cairn in Rajasthan which have not been endorsed by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).
Besides FDP approvals for more than two dozen finds are held up for some or the other reason. Fifteen discoveries lie abandoned in areas that have been relinquished by operators.

Sensex conquers Mount 28K; don t expect big-bang rally next year!BSE sensex
(Most analysts expect the…)
NEW DELHI: After rallying over 200 points in intraday trade, the Sensex lost momentum in late trade, but enthused investors as it closed above the crucial 28,000-mark.
The Sensex closed the day at 28,008.9, up 98.84 points. The Nifty ended the day at 8,383.30, up 20.6 points.
What lies ahead? Analysts say we should not expect a big-bang rally in 2015.
Benchmark indices, namely the Sensex & the Nifty, have rallied over 32 per cent so far in the year 2014, but a similar performance next year might be a little difficult as a lot of positives are already being factored in the price, say analysts.
India has been the top beneficiary of strong foreign flows when compared with other emerging market peers, largely on account of strong macros, stable currency and the Modi factor.
Most analysts expect the market to rally probably by 10 per cent to 15 per cent, while some even expect a negative or flat return for the year 2015.
"Eyeing a 20 per cent return in the next 12 months is far too optimistic and you are absolutely right in saying that India has been one of the top performing markets this year. Year-to-date the Sensex is well above 30 per cent," says Robert Parker, Senior Advisor, Credit Suisse.
"The upside in the Indian market, taking a 12-months view, is probably limited to a further 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Having said that, I reiterate my positive outlook for the Indian economy," he adds.
On Tuesday, global investment bank UBS recommended a target of 9,600 on the Nifty by end-2015, which presents an upside of nearly 15 per cent from current levels. That is half of what the markets delivered in the year 2014.
They remain bullish on Indian equities for the year 2015 considering the fact that the economic growth recovery is underway, which will sustain current valuations.
Unlike the last three years, UBS expects FY16 and FY17 earnings growth estimates of over 15 per cent to be met. The Nifty target of 9,600 is based on top-down expectation of 15 per cent earnings growth in FY16E and 18 per cent growth in FY17E (on a base of 13% in FY15E), explains UBS.
The S&P BSE Sensex rallied to 28,000 for the first time last week and is well on its way to touch 30k by the end of this year, and probably 35000 by December 2015, which only provides an upside of 25 per cent from current levels
According to an ET Now survey of 15 brokerage firms, conducted last month, reveals that most analysts are eyeing a level of 30000-35000 in the next 12 months.
As per the poll, 33 per cent of respondents are of the view that the Sensex could see the levels above 35000 in the next 12 months, while 50 per cent or majority of the respondents see the index trading in the range of 30000-35000. And, only 17 per cent of the respondents see the index hovering in the range of 26000-30000.
The government is making the right noises, moving the right levers, albeit a little slowly, but very-very steadily. But achieving a growth rate of over 6 per cent may take a while.
"Unlike what most market participants would like to believe, running a country is a little different from running the markets. So it is going to take a while to change," says Dipen Sheth, Head-Institutional Research, HDFC Securities.
"It is a huge country. We keep on talking of 125 crore people or what have you, and to get things to steer this big ship around is a little different from taking a quick U-turn on a scooter. We want to see everyday excitement on our screens and that is not going to happen," he adds.
There are some experts who think that the present momentum may not continue for long or in the next year, as the Reserve Bank of India may take a while before it starts cutting rates and the US may well hike interest rates, which would put some bit of pressure on the emerging markets, including India.
"Momentum may not continue as interest rates are going to be raised in the US next year. The RBI is not going to cut rates before FY16. So we can expect significant volatility," says Yogesh Nagaonkar, VP-Institutional Equities, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
"The Nifty can give no or negative returns in the next 1 year," he says, adding that the Budget will be the next big trigger for the Indian markets, and if the next Budget fails to live up to the expectations of the market (implementing key reforms such as GST ), then the market will react negatively.
Markets running ahead of fundamentals?
Most economists across brokerages feel that the economy has bottomed out, but will take time to pick up. With factors turning favourable, the growth is expected to gain momentum in FY16.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has lowered India's growth forecast to 5.4 per cent from 5.7 per cent estimated earlier for the current year, it expects the Indian economy to expand 6.4 per cent next year compared with 5.9 per cent estimated less than two months back in its September'14 interim outlook.
"In terms of underlying economic activity - whether it is credit off-take, auto sales or earnings numbers- it is clear that the economy has not really turned meaningfully," says Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO-Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital.
"My reading is that the second quarter growth will come in well below the Q1 number of 5.7 per cent. We are looking at a number closer to 5%. So there is a concern that the economy has not actually turned in a significant way," he adds.
Mukherjea is of the view that this is a slow recovery and it will take time to overcome the fundamental issues of the economy. The best way to make profit it is buy good-quality names, which will stand the test of time, because you will need to be patient to make money in India, he adds.

Indian markets have set a series of new highs since the third week of October, aided by strong foreign inflows and government's reform measures.
Foreign institutional investors have pumped in close to Rs 10,213 crore since October 20.
Bank stocks led the gains amid expectations that the RBI could cut rates earlier than expected. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC rose 1 per cent. Another rate-sensitive sector auto also saw buying action. Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp were up over 2 per cent.
Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India Research at UBS Securities, said buying from domestic investors is keeping the market supported. Equity mutual funds saw sixth straight month of inflows in October. This takes the six-month total to Rs 39,000 crore, the largest ever for a six-month period.
Indian markets gave up some gains in afternoon trade. At 2:31 pm, the Sensex was up 71 points while Nifty rose 9 points to 8,372.

Dubai, Nov 12:  
Dubai today became the first city in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to launch a tram service.
The tram, spanning 10.6 km and 11 stations that will cover major residential and commercial areas in the city, is also the first tram outside Europe powered entirely by on-ground electric cables, extending throughout the tramway and thus avoiding the need for hanging cables, Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) said in a statement.
The tram was inaugurated last evening by Shaikh Hamdan Bin Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, from Al Sufouh depot, who travelled in the tram with senior government officials. The tram was opened for the public this morning.
Each tram measures 44 meters in length and has a capacity to accommodate 405 riders. The tram is expected to serve around 27,000 people daily and, in the second stage, with an extension of 4 km and six more stations, the ridership is expected to increase to 66,000 daily.
The tram will be gender segregated with two cabins set aside for women and children, and a further car for ’gold-class’ passengers.
More than 150 police officers and 64 speed cameras have been employed to keep trams and cars apart and avoid accidents on the tram network.
Fines up to the tune of $8,160 can be slapped on car drivers if they cause a fatal accident on the tram network.

Petrol  diesel rates likely to be cut by Re 1Petrol, diesel rates likely to be cut by Re 1
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 12:  
Petrol and diesel prices are likely to be cut by close to Re 1 per litre this weekend on sliding global oil rates.
This would be the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August and the third in rates of diesel since its decontrol last month.
State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) following the fortnightly review practice, are due to revise rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday.
In all probability, rates will be reduced if the current trend of declining international oil prices continue, industry sources said.
Petrol price was last cut by Rs 2.41 a litre on November 1. On the same day, diesel rates were reduced by Rs 2.25 per litre. A litre of petrol in Delhi today costs Rs 64.25 a litre.
Since August, petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs 9.36 per litre.
Diesel price was for the first time in more than five years cut on October 19 by Rs 3.37 a litre when the government decided to deregulated the fuel. This was followed by another cut on November 1 and diesel currently costs Rs 53.35 a litre in Delhi.
Prior to the October 19 reduction, diesel rates were previously cut in January 2009.
Sources said oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee—US dollar exchange rate.
Brent crude fell for a third day amid signs that OPEC members are reluctant to reduce supply even as prices slumped deeper into a bear market. It declined by 82 cents to USD 80.85 per barrel.
Brent has lost almost 30 per cent since its June peak amid speculation that global supply is outpacing demand.

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
Mobile tower company Bharti Infratel has approached Vodafone and Idea Cellular to buy their mobile towers in seven out of 22 telecom circles in the country, a top official of the company said today.
“I have made it very clear to Vodafone and Idea Cellular that we are interested in buying their towers in seven circles where Bharti Infratel is sole operator and Indus doesn’t operate,” Bharti Infratel Executive Chairman Akhil Gupta said on sidelines of an event here.
Infratel has over 36,381 standalone mobile towers spread across 18 states under 11 telecom circles.
The company also has a 42 per cent stake in Indus Towers— joint venture between Bharti Infratel, Vodafone and Aditya Birla Telecom.
The states where Bharti Infratel has no overlapping business with Indus includes, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam and North Eastern states. These states jointly come under 7 telecom circles.

All systems go for comet landing: ESAPhilae will touch down about seven hours later before carrying out scientific experiments on its surface — a double first in space history. Photo credit: ESA
Darmstadt, Nov 12:  
The probe Philae has been given the green light to attempt the first landing on a comet today, the European Space Agency (ESA) said.
“We’ve got the final go” for the operation, an ESA spokeswoman said at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany.
A science lab bearing 10 instruments, Philae will be ordered to separate from its mother ship Rosetta at 0835 GMT and head towards Comet 67P/Churyumov—Gerasimenko, the agency said, after the last of four checks.
“Final Go/NOGO complete! We’re GO for separation!!!,” the Rosetta mission said in a tweet.
If all goes well, Philae will touch down about seven hours later before carrying out scientific experiments on its surface — a double first in space history.
Conceived in the 1980s, the Rosetta mission seeks to reveal secrets about the origins of the Solar System and maybe even life on Earth.
The USD 1.6—billion project was approved in 1993.
Rosetta, carrying Philae, was hoisted into space in 2004, but needed more than a decade to reach its target in August this year —— a six—billion—kilometre trek around the inner Solar System.

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by nearly 99 points at 28,008.90 on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors despite weak global cues.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty ended higher by 20.65 points at 8,383.30.
Among BSE sectoral indices, auto and banking indices were the star-performers and were up 1.18 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.37 per cent, followed by metal 0.9 per cent, PSU 0.57 per cent and capital goods 0.53 per cent.
Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and ITC were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel, NTPC and L&T.
The benchmark BSE Sensex surged 203.97 points or 0.73 per cent to trade at a new record-high of 28,114.03 in the morning session, breaking its previous peak of 28,027.96 reached on November 10.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade and hit a new life-time high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-share NSE index crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points or 0.53 per cent to trade at a life-time high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said that the domestic sentiment remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed the trading sentiment, they added.
A report by Equentis Capital said: "We expect markets likely to remain positive. Stay cautious and book profits on higher levels. The government will unveil IIP data for September 2014 and annual rate of inflation based on the combined consumer price indices (CPI) for urban and rural India for October 2014 on 12 November 2014. Inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for October 2014 will be released on 14 November 2014. Slower inflation could support regulators (RBI) to increase liquidity in the market in short-term and positive action by the regulators will be good for interest sensitive sectors/stocks."
European stocks
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS , Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Asian shares
Asian stocks extended their gains for the fourth day as Japanese shares climbed after the yen depreciated to a seven-year low amid speculation the nation will delay raising its sales tax again.
Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Nikkei 225 rose 73 points or 0.43 per cent at 17,197 and Hang Seng jumped 184.08 points or 0.77 per cent at 23,992.36.

The perils of surpluscapacityGold futures price falls on global cues
The issue of excess capacity is being cited as one of the primary reasons behind the downward trend in commodity prices. For crude oil, the OPEC group is restraining production to match it with falling demand. For many other products, specifically for products requiring extraction and exploration, the challenge of surplus capacity is taken care of by cutting down output. The same strategy is being pursued by BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Frotesque and coal miners of the US, Australia, Mozambique, South Africa and Indonesia.
The resources stay put under the ground, if not explored. For some other products, export thrusts may be a temporary way out, but looking at the subdued demand scenario all over the globe, this strategy may provide a temporary solution with reduced margin only.
According to latest WSD estimates, around 145 million tonne of finished steel is lying surplus in China after meeting domestic demand. It is not difficult to assume that in Japan, Russia and South Korea, the other major steel producing countries, surplus capacity is plaguing all and it has forced these countries to look for other destinations to sell their products.
In 2013, exports from these countries along with China formed nearly 40% of total global exports of finished steel. In some major products where China carries excess capacity, like rebars (estimated surplus capacity: 18 mt), wire rods (40 mt), HR coils (15 mt), galvanised/coated products (23 mt) and plates (30 mt), it has emerged as the major exporter to India.
In H1 of FY15, the Chinese share in total imports by India is: rebars/wire rods (63%), plates (45%), coated products (20%) and HR coils (29%). The surplus capacity in HR and CR in Japan and South Korea is shifted to India with 60% import share in HR, 59% share in CR and 79% share in coated/GP products.
It can be safely concluded that one of the objectives of FTAs and RCEPAs is to find a market for the surplus capacity that is creating job and income losses and poor capacity utilisation in some of these countries which are otherwise clamouring for fair and unrestricted trade.
The problem of excess capacity is in reality compounded in steel as production cuts enhance the fixed cost component of production apart from other technological problems associated with not running furnaces below the capacity for a longer duration.
In developed economies, the share of steel service centres that provide customised, tailor-made sizes, cut-to-length dimensions and shapes is more than 25% of total production. The inventory build-up by the centres to cater to the regular needs of the various processing industries provides an additional outlet for surplus steel.
India is way behind in realising the full potential of this phenomenon and instead many global producers like Posco, Arcelor Mittal, Corus and Nippon-Mitshubishi have created world class facilities in India, thanks to land and environment related issues that have kept them away from greenfield ventures.
Following the passing of MM&DR, allocation of coal blocks and initiation of demand boosting stimulus measures like investment in infrastructure and manufacturing growth in the country, all efforts by indigenous steel producers towards cost competitiveness and thrust on value-added products would continue to face stiff challenges from the steady flow of imports under concessional duties from countries weighed down under surplus capacity.

No Cong invite to Narendra Modi for Jawaharlal Nehru birth anniversary eventPrint
Sources said that Congress will not invite any leader of BJP and its allies for the event.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 7:28 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 7:55 pm
The Congress has not invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to an international conference it is organising to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, joining the battle with Modi, who it accuses of trying to appropriate freedom movement leaders.
The two-day event to highlight the legacy and worldview of the first Prime Minister is being organised on November 17 and 18 and will be attended by a host of international leaders and representatives of various political parties from India and abroad.
“We have not given any invitation to the Prime Minister. We have invited all those who truly believe in democracy and the ideals of Nehru,” Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said replying to a volley of media questions about whether it has invited Modi and why not.
Interestingly, the party has put out the eulogising remarks about Nehru made by BJP’s first Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the website specially launched for the event on Tuesday.
“Have we not acknowledged Atal Bihari Vajpayee. We are acknowledging all those who have said something meaningful. As a political party, we have our freedom to decide who subscribes to Nehru’s views,” he said.
Sources said that Congress will not invite any leader of BJP and its allies for the event.
The party has accused Modi of trying to appropriate leaders of the freedom movement like Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Nehru by launching special schemes and diverting attention from their legacy.
There is already a National Committee for commemoration of Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary chaired by the Prime Minister, which was reconstituted after the new government came to power.
Sharma said the conference will discuss Nehru’s views on democracy, inclusion and empowerment in India and for the representative global order. It will provide a platform to reflect on Nehru’s worldview and legacy in the context of contemporary global challenges.
The event is being organised separately by the Congress even as the government has already indicated that it will organise Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary this year in a mega way to increase awareness about ‘Chacha Nehru’ through a number of initiatives like organising ‘Year of Bal Swachhta’.
“Is it not the duty of Congress to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru, who was its leader…we are not subordinate to the government…We are neither the petitioners before the government nor we will make a demand when it comes to upholding the dignity of freedom fighters and our leaders,” Sharma said.
He was asked whether the AICC is trying to make the occasion an issue of confrontation with the government and whether it will demand that the government celebrate the occasion in a better way.
The official committee, initially set up by the Manmohan Singh government also included Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who had opted out of the committee continued…

Crude Fall Above Expectation  to Help Fight Inflation: RBIMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Mumbai: An ongoing decline in oil prices is more than what the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has expected and this will help in fighting inflation, the apex bank's Executive Director, Deepak Mohanty, said on Tuesday.
"Whatever assumptions we made in terms of oil prices and other commodity prices, subsequently what we see now is that the prices have come off even more. So, the disinflationary process would see a bit stronger than what the last policy had done," Mr Mohanty, whose remit includes the crucial monetary policy department, said at a conference.
The price of Indian crude basket has fallen to a low of around $81 a barrel as against $108.05 in May-end. At the last policy review on September 30, Governor Raghuram Rajan had said the trajectory of inflation was on course as assumed by the RBI in its glide path.
He had said the target of getting consumer price inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 was more certain, while the risks to the January 2016 target of 6 per cent had subsided.
It can be noted that the RBI has been very vocal with its resolve to contain inflation in a decisive manner and has been holding on to elevated rates to achieve this objective even at the cost of criticism from the pro-growth lobby, which wants a rate cut.
The comments from Mr Mohanty come days after Deputy Governor H R Khan flagged the concerns on inflation, pointing to systemic issues which are resulting in price rise.
The Executive Director said the lower crude prices, coupled with a stable currency has helped reduce inflation. He, however, expressed caution, saying one should not be "overly joyous" as the 6.46 per cent number will rise further soon.
"There is a base effect in that and we should not be overly joyous over the fact that we are at 6.5 per cent, but it could slightly go up as we go down the line," he said.
Mr Mohanty said that even though the headline inflation number is coming down, expectations of households continue to be for double digits inflation, which need to be addressed.
"The inflationary expectations of households continue to be high at double digits, it is important we bring down the expectation," Mr Mohanty said, adding that the government resolve to reduce fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent of GDP has also helped fight inflation.
He said there is also some moderation on the rural wages, which will help the inflation situation. Mr Mohanty said that with the reduction in inflation, policy rates have come in the positive territory after a long time.
He also defended the RBI's elevated rate stance, saying it is not affecting growth.
On exchange rates, he said the RBI intervenes in the market only in case of excess volatility and the forex reserves we have built up are "healthy".
Current account deficit, which had caused much damage to the currency last year, is "sustainable" at present, he said.
Mr Mohanty also expressed concern about diversion of savings into physical assets like gold, saying there is a need for the financial savings to grow.

To get future ready  RBI re-drafts core purposeTo get future ready, RBI re-drafts core purpose
G Naga Sridhar
To retain autonomy, independence of views
Hyderabad, November 11:  
In line with the changing demands of the economy, the Reserve Bank of India is re-thinking its role and function.
Contemplating a change in its core purpose, for the first time in its over 79 years of existence, the RBI is seeing a shift in its role from the bland “monetary stability” (in its current Preamble) to fostering “monetary and financial stability conducive to sustainable economic growth and to ensure the development of an efficient and inclusive financial system.”
Ready for approval
The draft of the new document re-stating the core purpose, values and vision — a copy of which is with BusinessLine — has been prepared by the senior management committee and will be sent to the central bank’s board for formal approval soon.
The purpose of the new vision, according to the RBI, is to delineate its strategic objectives and provide the framework and backdrop within and against which its policies will be formulated and the direction the bank would take.
The thinking at the RBI has been on these lines for quite some time now. During the central bank’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in April 2010, the then Governor D Subbarao had said: “Even at the risk of being clichéd, let me say that at the Reserve Bank, we need to ‘think global and act local’. The idea is not to fight globalisation but to manage it to the country’s best advantage.’’
Thus, the draft document focuses on issues of current importance such as autonomy in functioning, fostering confidence in the internal and external value of the rupee, and achieving inclusive growth. The RBI appears to be significantly enlarging its scope even while sending a strong message of retaining its “independence of views”, and “valuing’’ independent judgment in formulating its policies.
This goes well beyond what the Preamble says now “...to regulate the issue of bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.’’
Perfect timing
The vision document comes at a time the Government and the RBI have been discussing the central bank’s role. During a recent visit to the Indian School of Business here, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had said the central bank was discussing various issues with the Government, including fixing of inflation targets and implementation of the recommendations of the Financial Sector Legislature Reforms Committee on changes in the RBI’s role.

Five ways to keep cyber crime at bayFive ways to keep cyber crime at bay
Hannah Kuchler in San Francisco
©Dreamstime
The enemy within: Cyber threats have changed rapidly and defences are struggling to keep up
Target, Home Depot, Staples , Neiman Marcus, Michaels , Sally’s Beauty . What once looked like a list of US retailers is now a list of hacking victims, as cyber criminals attack chains in hope of harvesting millions and customer credit card details.
Cyber security industry experts say it was the attack on Target in last year’s holiday season that shook complacent boards awake to the threat of malicious hackers. But as the series of more recent victims shows, not every retailer has got its cyber security measures sorted as we head into the shopping season of 2014. Here are the five key things retailers should be doing:
More
Alibaba aims for ‘Singles’ day’ record
Get a third party assessment
Boards have often shied away from talking about security simply because they do not understand it. But relying on a company’s own security teams’ assessment is like having the students mark exam papers, warns David Burg, global and US advisory cyber security leader for PwC.
“The reality is that the beauty of objectivity, a separate set of eyes, maybe not the brain who created the approach, strategy and priorities works,” Mr Burg says. “Independent third parties help management understand what you’re good at and not.”
A third party – be it a security or consulting firm – can also compare your security to your peers, which is important as cyber criminals often choose the easiest targets.
Hire the right staff
Cyber threats have changed rapidly and defences are struggling to keep up. Experienced and capable security professionals are hard to find, particularly for retailers, as many of the best are lured by security or other technology companies. Paying the right salary for the right people is important, says Mr Burg. “The skills are in very high demand, so the supply demand equation means you have got to compensate this kind of professional, even though that can be a real problem when you are running on thin margins,” he says. “We don’t think many companies have that choice.”
Security should also be the responsibility of everyone in the organisation. David Katz, a partner and leader of the privacy and information security practice at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough in Atlanta, says people needed to start viewing data as the “new cash”. “You wouldn’t leave cash on the table so everyone should be responsible for protecting revenue,” he said.
Build internal walls inside the network
Retailers need to assume their adversary is already inside the network and ensure the company “crown jewels” are protected. Once an attacker is inside the perimeter there should be many more walls for them to overcome. This should help with the problem of giving suppliers access to your computer systems, which was how the attackers entered Target’s network, through a refrigeration and air conditioning supplier who should have been far from the customers’ financial data.
Many also try to enter through employee remote access logins, says David Ostertag, global investigations manager at Verizon, so the security on these should be improved. “First off, is to remove the availability of single factor authentication, and replace with multi-factor authentication at the access point. If that was in place, it would never happen,” he says.
Cyber criminals will try to get the login details of the people with the most access – the “God-level credentials”, as Mr Ostertag calls them – so these should be particularly well protected.
Share information
The latest spate of attacks on retailers have all been caused by malware, short for malicious software, so swapping tips on how to deal with such attacks could be helpful. Buying threat intelligence from cyber security companies is important, but so is sharing human intelligence with your peers, as the financial industry does informally and through the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center .
Retailers should certainly take a leaf out of the banks’ book, argues Margaret Tofalides, a data protection partner at law firm Clyde & Co. “Financial services have led the way in cyber security protections, due to information sharing on cyber risks in the market and the adoption of protective measures against cyber crime,” she says. “Retailers should be taking similar steps to share information.”
Insure yourself
Cyber attacks are going to happen and retailers are going to have to spend more on protecting themselves. But they should also be spending money on insurance for when the worst happens, says Mr Katz. The cyber insurance market is nascent but developing fast.
“I would be reviewing my [policies] very closely,” he says. “A lot of brokers and carriers sell policies and they may not appreciate the nuances and risks involved in these emerging areas. So we’re starting to see very specialised [insurance policies] being written. Brokers who specialise in this area are really critical to protecting an organisation.”

Sebi revamping listing agreement guidelines: SinhaSebi revamping listing agreement guidelines for greater enforcement, says UK Sinha
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 11:49 IST
Sebi Chairman UK Sinha
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Chairman UK Sinha on Tuesday said the existing listing agreement guidelines are being revamped and will be made into listing regulations shortly.
Speaking on the sidelines at a Morgan Stanley event in Mumbai on Tuesday evening, the chairman said, the listing guidelines were being changed into listing regulations so that they have more force of law.
Sinha also said the capital market regulator was working on new guidelines in the fields of prevention of insider trading and delisting regulation . Sebi has been encouraging institutional investors, especially mutual funds, to have a voting policy and also disseminate their voting pattern on various resolutions on their websites, he said.
On proxy advisory firms, the chairman observed that they should avoid conflict of interest. "You will recall that there have been some advisory firms which have now come up in the country and they are playing an important role. In the new regulations, which have come up, we have also been careful to place some discipline so that these advisory firms avoid any conflict of interest," the chairman said.
Earlier in the day on Tuesday, addressing a mutual fund summit organised by MorningStar, Sebi's whole-time member Prashant Saran said the market watchdog was revamping the listing agreement in general, and Clause 36 in particular, to make it mandatory for corporates to disclose non-events for the benefit of investors/share-holders.
"To build trust, we are reviewing Clause 36 of the listing agreement under which corporates have to disclose non-events. We found that disclosure are just fill in the blanks now. We have issued a discussion paper on Clause 36 so that investors get meaningful information," Saran said.
Under the new norms, corporates would be required to disclose non-events such as loss of market share or technology obsolescence on a periodic basis (annually to start with) to share-holders through an exchange filing, Saran added.
The capital market regulator had issued the discussion paper on August 19, 2014 which is expected to be taken up during the next board meeting scheduled for November 19.
Clause 36 of the listing agreement requires a listed entity to disclose details of all events which will have a bearing on the performance/operations of the listed entity as well as price sensitive information to stock exchanges immediately. This usually consists of information on events like labour strikes, lock-outs, closure on account of power cuts among others.

More safety features in cars will mean less road safety: Maruti chiefMercedes Benz inaugurates Chandigarh's largest dealership
RC Bhargava, chairman of the country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki, has cautioned the government against falling for any global body’s assertion that safety measures like airbags or disc brakes be made mandatory for all cars, even entry-level ones.
In an interview with FE, Bhargava said recommendations like the recent one from the Global NCAP (New Car Assessment Programme), a private autonomous body, would only expose consumers to more risks. He said that if carmakers incorporate such features in even entry-level cars, obviously the price would go up, which would lead consumers to opt for two-wheelers, which would be more unsafe.
He said that such findings by global autonomous bodies did not take into account Indian conditions and acting on them could be counterproductive.
“The intention should be to reduce road fatalities. Therefore, we have to take a total picture of Indian road issues. If you only take cars, that results in just 3-4% improvement. But this may also do damage somewhere else, because the risk factor of a person driving a two-wheeler is far higher than those driving even old Fiat cars,” he said.
“Are you overall helping or reducing safety? The person who graduates to a car from a two-wheeler is a very marginal guy, a little bit of price increase and he will push the purchase away for the next year. We saw that when the petrol prices went up, these guys could not afford cars,” he added.
Though the road ministry has not come forward with any concrete proposal so far, there have been suggestions at the official level to make airbags mandatory in all cars to increase road safety.
Going by current cost estimates, adding two front airbags to an entry-level and the country’s top-selling car like the Alto 800 would add about R30,000 to the starting price of R2.4 lakh. Further, adding an anti-lock braking system, which reduces braking distances especially in wet conditions, will further push the price up by about R10,000.
In the most recent tests conducted this month, Global NCAP tested the Maruti Swift and Datsun Go. In February this year, it had tested the Maruti Suzuki Alto 800, Tata Nano, Ford Figo, Hyundai i10 and Volkswagen Polo. Besides the Polo and Figo, all other cars completely failed the tests. The agency conducts side impact test, where another car hits the target vehicle at 40 kmph, and a frontal offset test at 64 kmph.
“People are talking of car safety and we have about 1.5 lakh road fatalities, therefore cars should be made more safe. None of these people have established any link between the number of deaths and cars. If you actually look at the data, there is huge difference. One point is that in the EU, 50% of the road fatalities are inside cars, but in India it is 16%. This is because two-wheelers and pedestrians are far higher,” Bhargava said.
He said that a “commercial angle” is always present in pushing such technologies. “Somebody wants to sell an airbag, what does he do? He pushes the safety angle. Nobody has yet proved that unsafe cars are the reason for higher road fatalities,” he said, adding that most companies now offer airbags in the top variants of all car models, so if buyers drive on highways at higher speeds, they can buy that version.
Incidentally, Global NCAP chairman Max Mosley has also written a letter to Nissan chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn asking the company to withdraw the “substandard” Datsun Go model from India and other markets because its body shell is so unstable that even adding airbags would be pointless.
Bhargava speak
There’s no linkage in India between road fatalities and unsafe cars
Unlike in EU countries where 50% road fatalities are inside cars, in India it is only 16%
There could be a commercial angle in pushing such safety technologies
Such measures can improve road safety by only 3-4%
Features like airbags are offered in higher-end cars

BJP govt wins trust vote in Maharashtra Assembly
The development was preceded by the unanimous election of BJP leader Haribhau Bagde as the new Speaker of the Maharashtra assembly.
Yahoo India –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014

MUMBAI: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' minority government Wednesday won the vote of confidence of the state assembly by a voice vote, while the Shiv Sena opted for the role of opposition here.
The development was preceded by the unanimous election of BJP leader Haribhau Bagde as the new Speaker of the Maharashtra assembly.
The Congress and Shiv Sena cried foul over the newly-elected speaker's decision to reject the demand for balloting in the trust vote and instead to settle for a voice vote.
State Congress president Manikrao Thakre alleged that the government has failed to prove its majority as per Governor C.V. Rao's directives.
"This is a murder of democracy and the entire state has witnessed it. This government continues to be in minority and must resign immediately," Thakrey demanded.
Shiv Sena's Ramdas Kadam and other leaders also demanded a count of the voice votes to ascertain how many were in favour of the BJP government.
Thakre said a delegation of all parties would meet the governor to apprise him of the developments.
"We will urge the governor to either order a fresh of vote of confidence since today's vote was not done properly. The A.B. Vajpayee government in the past at the Centre had fallen because of just one vote. Here, this government fell short of at least 25 votes and has no right to continue. We will not allow the government to work," he declared.
Congress Legislature Party leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said the ruling party violated rules and must seek a fresh vote of confidence of the house.

BlackBerrys profit from India declines 50% to Rs 11.46 croreEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry’s Indian arm, BlackBerry India saw its net profit decline sharply in fiscal 2014, by around 50% year-on-year to Rs 11.46 crore. According to the standalone balance sheet for fiscal 2014 filed with the Registrar of Companies by BlackBerry India, the company’s revenues nearly halved to R142.05 crore in FY14.
Analysts state that the earnings reported by BlackBerry in India aren’t surprising as the company has seen its smartphone sales in the rapidly growing Indian market decline, as it lost out market share to rivals selling phones based on Google’s Android operating system.
“BlackBerry’s revenue constitutes services, software and devices. Over the past one year, our focus has been on driving profitable growth thru an optimal mix of all the above. I am happy to state that this strategy is paying off for us in India with over 1000 enterprises adopting BlackBerry
Enterprise Service 10 during this period,” a BlackBerry India spokesperson said in an email.
While the Canadian parent company has been running in losses, India is one of Blackberry’s profitable markets and, in fact, the company saw its net profit and turnover from India improve year-on-year between FY11 and FY13.
The decline in BlackBerry’s turnover in India mirrors the trend in the reported earnings of the parent company in 2014. BlackBerry reported a 38.5% y-o-y drop in its revenues at $6.81 billion, while its net losses widened to $5.87 billion from $646 million in fiscal 2013.
According to Anshul Gupta, principal analyst at Gartner, the total shipment of BlackBerry handsets to India in FY14 stood at a third of what the company shipped in the previous fiscal.
BlackBerry, which is repositioning itself as a provider of enterprise solutions, is banking on the widespread adoption of the BYOD (bring your own device) concept in India to drive revenues. BlackBerry’s earlier generation of enterprise solutions was restricted to its own operating system and smartphones. But the new generation of solutions is being customised for platforms like Android, iOS and Windows, and will be rolled out in India soon. The company expects these initiatives to boost earnings in the coming quarters.
“BlackBerry is still relatively new in the enterprise market in India. While their device sales are not doing so well, and their financial numbers are not exciting, they are bringing their latest services from global launches to the Indian market which is a exciting prospect for the company going forward,” Gupta said.

Aurobindo Pharma set to acquire US nutritional supplements maker Natrol for $133Editorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Aurobindo Pharma is all set to acquire troubled US-based nutritional supplement maker, Natrol Inc for USD 132.5 million (over Rs 810 crore) after emerging as the highest bidder for acquisition.
Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc, a subsidiary of the Hyderabad-based firm, has emerged as the highest bidder for acquisition of Natrol Inc and other affiliate entities, under a process to be finally approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
“Under the auction process, Aurobindo USA emerged as the highest and best bidder with a bid of USD 132.5 million to acquire the assets of Natrol with an agreement to take on certain liabilities,” Aurobindo Pharma said in a statement.
The buyout of Natrol would provide the right platform for creating a fully-integrated OTC platform in the US and other international markets, it added.
Natrol, which manufactures and sells nutritional supplements in US and other international markets, provides Aurobindo with strong brand reputation and presence in a variety of attractive supplement markets, it said.
“This acquisition is subject to final approval by the US court and other statutory approvals as may be required, including any termination of the waiting period or approval under the HSR Act, and closing conditions as per the Asset Purchase Agreement,” Aurobindo Pharma said.
Barclays acted as the sole financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as the legal counsel to Aurobindo USA, it added.
Aurobindo Pharma shares were trading at Rs 1,066 apiece on the BSE, up 3.69 per cent from its previous close.

Stalin calls Panneerselvam  benami  CM  says he is scared to convene assemblyPrint
Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: November 12, 2014 1:44 pm
With Chief Minister O Panneerselvam rubbishing the opposition demand to convene the winter session of legislative assembly, which usually begins in October, DMK treasurer M K Stalin said history is just repeating in Tamil Nadu as the CM is scared to convene the assembly. Stalin, in his Facebook post on Tuesday, recalled that Panneerselvam did not convene the assembly even once during his previous tenure also.
Calling him a ‘benami’ CM, Stalin said Panneerselvam’s helplessness can neither be condoned nor pardoned. “Your duty is to serve the people of Tamil Nadu, your subservience to convicted criminals cannot be above that,” he said.
“With a host of problems facing Tamil Nadu, it is the duty of elected members to find solutions and address issues that affect the state. But Panneerselvam seems to have forgotten or is rather too frightened to admit that he is the Chief Minister,” said Stalin, adding that belittling his request to convene the assembly is an act of humiliating himself and the post he holds.
Stalin demanded to convene the assembly to pass a resolution seeking the protection of the five Indian fishermen sentenced to death in Sri Lanka and to discuss issues like milk price hike.
On Tuesday, reacting to Stalin’s demand, Panneerselvam said Stalin has been taking efforts to “fish in troubled waters.” “We are expediting all steps to save the five fishermen, while his intention is to fish in troubled waters, which will not fructify,” said the CM in a statement.
Listing out the number of steps the government is taking to save fishermen and a financial aid to fight case, Panneerselvam said the government knows when to convene the Assembly. “There is no need to get advice from Stalin about this,” he said. He also alleged that throughout the assembly sessions in the last three years, DMK has been making false charges and creating confusion when Ministers replied and staging walkout or getting evicted. “DMK should explain if it wants to re-enact the same drama again,” he said.

Honda Motor grandees chide CEO Takanobu Ito over quality, recalls
Reuters Nov 12, 2014, 03.04PM IST
(Honda has recalled some…)
BEIJING/TOKYO: Two former Honda Motor chiefs have called on CEO Takanobu Ito this year, urging him to focus more on quality issues, increasing the pressure he's already under from U.S. regulators and politicians over mass air bag recalls.
Nobuhiko Kawamoto and Hiroyuki Yoshino made separate visits to Ito at the Japanese car maker's Tokyo headquarters, three people familiar with the visits said. They said the former CEOs had a firm message for Ito, 61, urging him to act quickly on quality issues that risk damaging the Honda brand.
Honda has recalled some 9.5 million cars of various models since 2008 for potentially defective air bag inflators made by Takata Corp. It has also had five recalls of the electric-gasoline hybrid versions of its Fit subcompact car and Vezel crossover utility vehicle since their launch just last year, and five recalls on its Super Cub utility motorbike since 2011.
"We don't know how, but Honda is fraying around the edges," said one of the knowledgeable individuals, who was on Honda's management board in the 1980s and was briefed on the visits by Yoshino and Kawamoto. The people didn't want to be named as the meetings they described were private.
"All of us think there's something more fundamentally wrong with the company," he said, referring to a group of concerned Honda former senior executives. "But all the company's doing is to get through recalls one by one instead of comprehensively reviewing operations."
NO PRESSURE TO QUIT
Kawamoto, 78, who was Honda CEO from 1990-98, visited Ito last month and had "stern words", one of the knowledgeable individuals said, about the sharp rise in recent recalls.
"We think there's little sense of crisis at Honda," the knowledgeable former executive said. "That frustration drove Kawamoto to go out of his way to meet Ito. I'm not sure Ito got the point."
And earlier this year, Yoshino, a 75-year-old engineer who was Honda's CEO from 1998-2003, told Ito he must focus on day-to-day operations at Honda rather than accept an invitation to be head of Japan's automobile manufacturers association.
The knowledgeable individuals said there was no pressure from the former executives on Ito to resign. "There's a rumour that Kawamoto asked Ito to step down, but if that's true Ito would be gone by now," one of them said.
Akemi Ando, a Honda spokeswoman in Tokyo, declined to comment specifically on the visits. "Generally speaking, visits from former executives are not that unusual. We receive advice from them on various issues," she said.
The message to Ito may be getting through.
Having agreed last month to take a pay cut of one-fifth for three months in the wake of the Fit recalls, he said this week he would put quality improvements ahead of Honda's sales targets, echoing Toyota chiefs' re-prioritisation five years ago when they were reeling from mass recalls over sudden-acceleration in some of their cars.
SUPPLY SWITCH
The former executives believe Honda's recall problems may stem in part from a decision Ito made after he took over in 2009 to change how the company develops and procures components.
Honda achieved industry-leading levels of quality over the past three decades through forming 'keiretsu' - bringing parts makers closer to the core through cross-shareholdings to allow close cooperation in designing components. Toyota and Nissan had similar set-ups.
But, as cars have become less mechanical and more technical - and quality is seen as a given - the focus has shifted to who can offer buyers 'more car' at an affordable price. That has prompted automakers like Honda to focus on core technology such as hybrid propulsion and hydrogen fuel-cell cars, while commoditised parts like doors, seats, and even transmission, are now procured more widely rather than from 'keiretsu' suppliers, with the risk they may be cheaper rather than better.
"We think this change might have been one cause for some of the recalls we've seen," one of the knowledgeable individuals said, adding he thinks Honda engineers may now be having to do too much.
Ando said Honda selects suppliers around the world "looking at competitiveness (and) weighing their ability to deliver quality and cost effective parts timely."

Let's say you're a veteran with lots of free time — and big ambitions to rake in plenty of pay-back for your service to your country.
Well, some of America's biggest and most patriotic brands have three words of advice for you:  go for it.
If you play your cards right on Veterans Day — and some other days, too — here's how freebie-seeking veterans and active military can cash in. This list is not comprehensive — and some require military ID or have other requirements.
YOUR TAKE: Honor your favorite vet
• Get a free haircut. Veterans who visit Great Clips shops on Nov. 11, can either receive a free haircut — or a card for a free haircut to redeem by Dec. 31.
• Eat a free meal. At Hooters, the freebie meal on Veterans Day can be worth up to $10.99, with any drink purchase.  Applebee's, Chili's and California Pizza Kitchen all offer free meals from a special menu to vets and active military.
• Eat a free buffet. Golden Corral is serving free dinner buffets (with beverages) from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 17, at all restaurants, to anyone who is serving or who has served in the military.  That same date, Bonanza Steakhouses also will offer free buffets for vets and active military.
• Down a free burger. Shoney's offers its signature All-American Burger, free, to vets or active duty military all day on Veterans Day. Or, you can head to Red Robin and get a Red's Tavern Double burger with Bottomless Steak Fries, on the house. Max & Erma's offers a free cheeseburger combo and dessert to vets and active military.
• Drink a free coffee. Starbucks is offering a free, tall brewed coffee on Tuesday to all U.S. military veterans and active duty servicemembers — and their spouses.
• Scarf down free pancakes. IHOP offers vets and active military free Red, White and Blue pancakes from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday.  Bob Evans also has all-you-can-eat hotcakes on Veterans Day for veterans and active military.
• Lick a free cone. Handel's Homemade Ice Cream and Yogurt shops are giving away free single-scoop ice cream cones to all veterans and military personnel on Tuesday.
Work-out for free. 24-Hour Fitness offers free use of the health club to vets and active military through Tuesday.
• Enjoy a free appetizer. Red Lobster, through Thursday, is offering free appetizers to veterans and active duty military.
• Sip a free beer. Restaurants owned by CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries (including Gordon Biersch Brewery, Rock Bottom, Old Chicago Pizza and ChopHouse & Brewery) offer a free craft beer to active and retired military Tuesday.
• Down a free doughnut — and coffee. Krispy Kreme will give a free doughnut and small coffee to anyone who identifies themselves as a veteran or active duty military on Veterans Day.
• Get free game tokens. Chuck E. Cheese will give 20 free tokens to U.S. military vets and active-duty military through Saturday.
• Get your junk hauled, free. For disabled veterans, JDog Junk Removal & Hauling locations, will offer free junk removal to disabled vets who book on Veterans Day.

While Black Friday may be a couple of weeks away, several companies are getting a jump on the holiday shopping season releasing their planned deals now. On Tuesday both Target and Best Buy joined the fray, releasing their full Black Friday catalog on their respective websites.
As with holiday seasons past, electronics are a big feature in Black Friday sales. Both retailers are planning deep discounts on TVs, with Best Buy offering a 50-inch Panasonic LED HDTV for just $199.99 and Target charging $219.99 for a 39-inch Vizio LED HDTV, $130 off its usual price. As with other major deals, these two are "doorbusters" and are in-store only.
Both stores are also offering deep discounts on Beats headphones, Fitbit fitness trackers, iPads, including the new iPad Air 2, and individual Blu-rays and video games. The two retail giants will also be selling a PlayStation 4 bundled with Grand Theft Auto 5 and The Last of Us for $399.99.

Other notable deals from Target so far include an Xbox One Assassin's Creed Bundle (including the new Assassins Creed Unity as well as last year's Assassin's Creed Black Flag) with a $50 Target gift card for $329.99 as well as a Google Chromecast for $25.
In addition to the Panasonic TV deal, Best Buy has a few other notable deals including an 11.6-inch MacBook Air with 128 GB of storage for $779.99 ($120 off its usual price), a 4 GB Amazon Kindle for $49.99 ($30 off, though this is not the latest Kindle Voyage), and $100-$150 off of Microsoft Surface Pro 3s with at least 128 GB of storage.
While there is still some time before these deals go into effect, both Target and Best Buy have made their full catalogs available for your scouting on their respective sites. The stores will also be following the recent trend of opening Thanksgiving night, with Best Buy opening its doors at 5 PM local time and Target following at 6 PM local time. Best Buy however will close its stores at 1 AM local time to prepare for a reopening at 8 AM on Black Friday itself. It has also said that it will be doing separate "doorbusters" during each opening.

  Government Considering Raising Import Duty on SteelGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: India is considering raising import duty on steel due to surging shipments from China, and a decision may be taken in the next two to three days, Steel and Mines Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Wednesday.
India's steel imports from China, the world's biggest producer of the alloy, doubled in April-September from a year earlier, though the country has enough capacity to meet its demand. Steelmakers such as JSW Steel Ltd are clamouring for higher import tariffs as a result.

Modi dividend  driving SAsia growth: UK Dy PM CleggNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
UK’s Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has attributed South Asia’s projected growth momentum this year to the “Modi dividend”, citing the Indian Prime Minister’s initiatives for boosting investment and jobs.
The UK’s coalition leader quoted recent World Bank figures, which forecast South Asia to grow by over 6 per cent this year, making it the second-fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific region.
“A huge amount of this momentum is being driven by what the World Bank calls the Modi dividend,” Clegg said in his address at the annual dinner event organised by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Asian Business Association (ABA) here last evening.
“Prime Minister Modi has made boosting investment, jobs and growth a priority for his Government and, when I met with him in the summer, we discussed the critical role Britain could play in helping India realise its ambitions,” he added.
The Liberal Democrat leader also stressed on the important contribution made by Asian businesses to the British economy.
“There are an estimated 300,000 ethnic-minority led SMEs [small and medium enterprises] in the UK, contributing around 30 billion British Pounds to the UK economy every year.
“You are wealth creators in every sense of the word,” he said, adding, his party stands for an economy that is open to immigration.
“I have been clear about my concerns regarding the way in which the debates over immigration and Europe in this country are moving. There are critical issues to address… but, more than ever, responsible politicians and businesses need to defend Britain’s status as an open economy,” he said.
The ABA was set up in 1995 to provide a voice for London’s Asian origin business community, which brings in approximately 60 billion British Pounds to the UK economy every year and accounts for nearly 13 per cent of the city’s annual turnover.
“We with the London Chamber of Commerce will continue to campaign for a freeze, and gradual reduction, in air passenger duty (APD) to put us on a level playing field with our competitors and European partners,” said ABA chairman Vijay Goel, in reference to a surcharge on air passengers from the UK.
“As an island economy dependent on air links, the UK should encourage, rather than penalise activity like air travel that connects people and markets enabling greater trade,” he added.
The leading NRI lawyer also wowed to continue to campaign for a liberalised immigration policy to secure a “practical policy that facilitates the passage of the highly skilled workers that London needs”.
“In a similar vein, we will lobby for changes to the UK visa regime to ensure that genuine businessmen and women – the very life-blood of the capital’s economy – can swiftly enter the UK to do business without enduring bureaucratic delays in processing or lengthy queues upon arrival at London airports,” Goel said.

Indirect tax collections rise 5.6 per cent i...Arun Jaitley
(Indirect tax revenues rose…)
NEW DELHI: Indirect tax collections grew by 5.6% in first seven months of the current financial year, indicating that the government could well miss the budget target of more than 20% rise in collections this fiscal.
The government has managed to collect Rs 2.85 crore in indirect taxes during April-October, or 45.7% of the budget target of over Rs 6.24 lakh for the full fiscal, raising concerns of fiscal slippage.Excise duty collections, levied on manufactured goods at factory gate, declined by 1.2% during the seven month period to Rs 88,330 crore, an official statement said on Wednesday.
Service tax collections increased 10.9% during the period under review to Rs 90,673 crore while customs duty mop-up rose 7.5% to over Rs 1.06 lakh crore.In the month of October indirect tax collections were up 7.5% on the strength of a 19.5% rise in customs collection. Excise collections were up 1.4% and service tax 1.2%.
While economic growth is expected to improve to 5.4%-5.9% this fiscal after remaining at sub-5% levels in the last two years, it's unlikely that indirect tax collections will achieve the ambitious growth target of 20.28%.Economists have already expressed concerns over slower revenue growth."Declining crude prices have improved both the fiscal outlook as well as the inflation outlook.
No doubt the decline in the oil subsidy is a breather for the government on the expenditure front, but slow growth in tax collection so far is a major concern on the revenue front," D K Pant, chief economist at India Ratings, said in a note. "According to our estimate fiscal deficit would be 4.2% of the GDP in FY15, marginally higher than the budget estimate of 4.1%."
Finance minister Arun Jaitley is keeping a close tab on the tax collections and held a review meeting with the apex indirect taxes body, the Central Board of Excise and Customs.
The diktat from the North Block is clear that collections should be augmented without harassing taxpayers.
The department of revenue has pitched for a rejig in indirect taxes rate on petroleum products and crude as it had to undertake cut in revenues to provide cushion to consumers when crude prices skyrocketed.

Maharashtra: Fadnavis wins trust vote; Sena  Cong fumeThe BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra won a crucial confidence motion on Wednesday through a voice vote that the Shiv Sena described as “strangling democracy” and the Congress called “a black day”.
 
The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member assembly, passed the test to prove its majority through a simple “Aye” from legislators supporting the 13-day-old minority government, though their voice got muffled in the din raised by the Shiv Sena and the Congress.
 
Speaker Haribhau Bagde suspended five Congress legislators for two years after they allegedly heckled governor C Vidyasagar Rao who was injured in the melee as protests inside and outside the assembly turned ugly.
 
The BJP government needed to prove its majority because it was 22 short of the halfway mark in the assembly. Having snapped its 25-year alliance with the Shiv Sena, it didn’t have the 63 MLAs of its former ally to bail it out.
 
Bagde, who was elected unopposed earlier in the day, called the voice vote valid and rejected the opposition’s demand for a poll.
 
“The house should be run as per rules and the Constitution should not be trampled upon. The new government is strangling democracy. We sought division but the trust motion was passed by voice vote,” said opposition leader Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena.
 
The Congress questioned the legitimacy of the trust vote and said it would approach the governor with the request to ask the Fadnavis government to prove its majority by a poll.
 
“This is the darkest day in the history of the Maharashtra assembly. We will not allow the house to function under this minority government,” said former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan.
 
Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam said the BJP government’s act was against the spirit of the Constitution and threatened to take legal recourse. “Vidhan Sabha stands tarnished today. A division would have made it clear whether they have the support of the majority of MLAs. The confidence motion has not been passed.”
 
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Bagde rubbished the opposition’s claims, saying due process was followed.
 
"Congress and Shiv Sena did not ask for a poll (division of votes) at the appropriate time. Since Congress has always been in power it has forgotten the rules about when to ask for division of votes,” Fadnavis told reporters
 
All this while MLAs of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which had committed its support to the Fadnavis government, sat quietly and watched the opposition demand a division. The division of votes, which according to convention is held with legislators voting for or against a motion, was ruled out by the Speaker.
 
The BJP had said it had direct and indirect support of 140 MLAs but needed some legislators to vote for it or abstain in the event of a poll.
 
Since there was no clarity on which way the NCP voted, the speaker’s move was seen as an attempt to save the BJP the embarrassment of publicly going along with Sharad Pawar’s party that has 41 MLAs, sources said.
 
Despite the day’s developments, the BJP indicated in the evening that it was still open to an alliance with the Sena. Fadnavis told HT that he has plans to expand his cabinet before the winter session of the legislature begins in Nagpur on December 8.

Jharkhand polls: JMM to release manifestoagainPrint
By: Express News Service | Ranchi | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:59 pm
The JMM will release a new manifesto for the Jharkhand Assembly elections, reportedly after the one released on Monday was riddled with errors.
The manifesto released by Shibu Soren on Monday was surprisingly brief and had a number of grammatical as well as spelling errors. It contained only a page on the achievements of the outgoing government under Hemant Soren.
The manifesto even failed to mention the party’s stand on the domicile policy, something that has been at the core of what the JMM stand for. General Secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the new manifesto would be released on Wednesday. “We were missing a page… It was not because we made mistakes,” he said. When asked about the absence of domicile policy, Bhattacharya said the new manifesto would correct that mistake: “The missing page was about the domicile policy.”

A Syrian activist group says U.S.-led coalition airstrikes against the Islamic State group and other extremists have killed more than 860 people, including civilians, since they began in mid-September.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the vast majority those killed — 746 people — have been Islamic State militants. It says another 68 people killed were members of al-Qaida’s Syrian affiliate known as the Nusra Front.
The Observatory also said on Wednesday that at least 50 civilians, including eight children and five women, have been killed in the airstrikes.
The U.S.-led coalition’s aerial campaign in Syria began on Sept. 23. The Islamic State group has been the primary target, although on at least two occasions the United States has carried out strikes targeting the Nusra Front as well.

Govt provides operational flexibility to oil cos | Price cut likely by Nov 15Government provides operational flexibility to oil firms

(Operational flexibility…)
NEW DELHI: In a bid to make it easier to produce oil and gas, the government has notified a set of rules granting operational flexibility to firms like Cairn India and ONGC to start producing from several discoveries that are mired in contractual disputes.
The Petroleum Ministry in a notification relaxed rigid timelines prescribed in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for development and production of oil and gas.
"The Government of India hereby notifies Policy Framework for Relaxations, Extension and Clarifications at the Development and Production Stage under the PSC regime for early monetisation of hydrocarbon discoveries," the order said.
Operational flexibility has been provided in enforcing contracts by way of relaxing some of timelines prescribed for discoveries so that E&P activities do not suffer on account of excessive rigidity in decision making.
The PSC between the government and the explorer has rigid timelines for each stage of exploration and actions have been initiated against firms even if deadlines are missed by a day.
The notification said 3-6 months extension in the current 18-60 month timeframe for submission of declaration of commerciality (DoC) of discoveries, a prerequisite before investment plans can be finalised, can be given.
Also, the deadline for submission of investment plan for the discoveries too would be extended by up to six months.
The PSC provides for time period for submission of field development plan (FDP) for hydrocarbon discovery after DOC. There is no provision in the PSC for extension of this time period and non-acceptance of FDP due to late submission results in non-monetisation of discoveries.
Also, upstream regulator DGH has been given flexibility to accept discoveries for which operators had failed to provide prior notification to the government.
The notification also provided for reduction in committed work programme in case a block or its part is not available for exploration activities consequent to denial of permission by government agencies.
Reduction of minimum work programme (MWP) will be considered in case of "blocks overlapping with Special Economic Zone (SEZ), reserve forest, naval exercise areas, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) danger zones, National Parks, urban areas and firing ranges of police/armed forces," it said.
Currently, discoveries, mostly of Cairn, ONGC and GSPC are stuck because of lack of flexibility in timelines. These include 10 finds of Cairn in Rajasthan which have not been endorsed by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).
Besides FDP approvals for more than two dozen finds are held up for some or the other reason. Fifteen discoveries lie abandoned in areas that have been relinquished by operators.

Monkeys create panic in Shimla  kill womanMarauding monkeys create panic in Shimla, woman dies
By Vishal Gulati | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Mon 10 Nov, 2014

Shimla, Nov 10 (IANS) Marauding monkeys prowling in gangs on the streets of this popular tourist resort has created panic among residents and tourists with a woman being their latest victim.
A mother of two died last week after falling off the roof of her house. According to the police, Mamta Sachdeva was on the balcony when she was attacked by the simians. She jumped off the balcony in panic.
In another incident, a girl was bitten by a langur in her school Friday.
"They have been causing havoc by biting the passersby, stealing food and brawling on the streets," said local resident Ambika Sharma.
"It's an extremely dicey situation once again as the wildlife officials tasked with managing the monkeys have failed to check the menace," she added.
Shimla Municipal Corporation deputy mayor Takinder Panwar charged the government with failure to contain the menace.
"On an average, more than 100 dog bite and over 60 monkey bite cases are being reported every month in the Rippon Hospital (which was set up in 1884 by the British rulers and functioned as the government district hospital) alone," he said.
Panwar said the monkey menace has reached an alarming proportion and needs to be tackled scientifically.
Kuldeep Singh Tanwar, state convener of farmers' outfit Kheti Bachao Sangharsh Samiti, said that selective killing of the marauding simians is the only solution.
"The state high court in 2011 restrained the state government's decision to allow farmers to shoot monkeys that have been destroying their crops and fruits. Since then the previous (BJP) and the present government (Congress) have failed to convince the court about the need to declare to go for selective killing," Tanwar told IANS.
Export of monkeys, which was allowed till 1978, for research is the only option to tackle their growing numbers, Tanwar added.
Coming down heavily on the state government, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Kurian Joseph and Justice V.K. Ahuja Jan 6, 2011, directed authorities to stop issuing permits to kill monkeys.
"The state should have to protect all the beings... by giving permission to kill the problematic monkeys, the state has not understood and applied its mind to understand the basic intent of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act," the bench had observed.
The interim order came on the petitions of the state chapter of non-governmental organisation People for Animals (PFA) and central agency Animal Welfare Board of India, which challenged the government decision to allow killings of monkeys which have been damaging crops.
The petitions are still pending in the high court.
In localities like Jakhu, Tutikandi, Nabha, Phagli, Kaithu, Summer Hill, Tutu, Boileauganj, Chotta Shimla and Sanjauli, the residents have literally converted their houses into jails by erecting iron grills on the doors and windows to check the intrusion of monkeys.
Himachal Pradesh Forest Development Corp vice chairman Kewal Pathania said the government has been taking measures to deal with the monkey menace.
A multi-pronged strategy is being adopted so that besides preventing damage to standing crops, the common people could be saved from nuisance of the wild animals.
Pathania, quoting Forest Minister Thakur Singh Bharmouri, said the government would bring a resolution in the next legislative assembly session seeking permission for lifting the ban on the export of monkeys.
More than 85,000 monkeys have been sterilized till date through seven monkey sterilization centres, he added.
Wildlife officials said around seven years ago the monkeys were trapped from Shimla and banished to the jungles and that was the best technique to reduce their population.
"Now their population has grown manifold and they need to be relocated once again," said an official.

In February this year, Vodafone bought some back-up spectrum in the 1800 MHz band in a few circles. According to Marten Pieters, the company does not have enough quality spectrum. The day is not very far when telecom companies in the country will have to shell out more for spectrum acquisition than what they would need to spend for developing the infrastructure if the government continues with its current stand, Vodafone India managing director and chief executive officer Marten Pieters said in ...

Vodafone CEO wants govt to release more spectrumVodafone CEO wants govt to release more spectrum
Venkatesh G
Bangalore, Nov 12:  
Vodafone CEO Martin Pieters believes that there is an urgent need to release more spectrum.
Addressing delegates at the CeBIT India conference, Pieters emphasised the need for spectrum at a time when the government has plans to have 600 million broadband users by 2020.
"No way it is possible unless spectrum is released. Already the quality of services is getting impacted due to shortage of spectrum," he added.
The problem is not confined to Vodafone and others are also facing similar constraints, according to industry watchers.
Pieters is hopeful that the new government will address these issues. "In the past, we had written to the government but did not get any response," he said.
The company gets 50 per cent of its revenues from data and this growth needs more spectrum, according to analysts.

Translation row: UPSC puts up reference details onlineTranslation row: UPSC puts up reference details online
PTI

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has put details of the methodology used in translation of questions from English to Hindi language on its Web site to help the candidates of various competitive examinations conducted by it.
The details include glossary of words used in Hindi and in other languages in subjects such as geography, administration, history, business and communication, among others, which are asked in the examination.
UPSC, which conducts the civil services examination to select IAS, IPS and IFS officers, among others, uses terminologies or translation of words from the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT).
The move comes following a recommendation of a three-member committee that went into issues relating to Hindi translation in various examinations conducted by UPSC, official sources said.
Some students had complained of anomalies in Hindi translation in questions asked in this year’s civil services preliminary examination. After that, UPSC constituted the committee to look into the matter.
A link to CSTT’s website — www.cstt.nic.in — has been put up on the UPSC portal to help the aspirants.
CSTT is mandated to evolve and define scientific and technical terms in Hindi and all Indian languages and publish glossaries, definitional dictionaries and encyclopaedia.
It also ensures that the terms evolved by it and their definitions reach the students, teachers, scholars, scientists and officers.

European markets pull back on FX settlementEuropean markets pull back on FX settlement
Reuters
Tweet
London, Nov 12:  
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS, Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Barclays was among the biggest losers, down 2 per cent, after the FCA regulator said its investigation into the bank was continuing.
“Even though the fines are manageable, the news flow for the banks remains negative, and the latest fines come on top of massive fines such as the one paid by BNP Paribas. Banks are getting increasingly reluctant to take risks,’’ said Saxo Bank trader Pierre Martin.
Quarterly trading updates put UK retail stocks under pressure: J Sainsbury sank 5.0 per cent and Tesco fell 3.7 per cent after Sainsbury took a hit on profits and the dividend to fund lower prices for customers.
Nikkei hits 7-year high
Such price moves contrasted with the 0.4 per cent rise in Japan’s benchmark Nikkei index, which earlier touched a seven-year high and put the rest of Asia in the shade amid expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would postpone a planned tax hike and may call an election for December.
That followed a surprise ramping-up of economic stimulus by the Bank of Japan at the end of October that has seen the yen fall to multi-year lows against the dollar.
“A snap election is likely to generate greater support for Abe and his policies and keep the bias for yen weakness,’’ said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.
Bond yields
Investors took refuge in core bonds, where German yields nudged lower ahead of a two-year bond auction where demand for the zero-interest-bearing paper was seen supported by the prospect of more European Central Bank policy easing, though investors have cast doubt on the timing of more stimulus.
Also in focus was the Bank of England’s latest economic outlook, which was expected to signal that British interest rates will stay at a record low until around the middle of next year.
ECB growth forecast
Economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank to trim forecasts for growth and inflation it published three months ago because prospects elsewhere in Europe have dimmed and a four-year low in oil prices is pushing down inflation.
Oil prices extended their recent drop over fears of cooling demand and a supply glut, with Brent falling to $81.04 per barrel and US crude prices down 67 cents to $77.29.
“Given the weakening fundamental outlook, we are reducing our allocation to Europe stocks and shifting the proceeds to the US and Japan,’’ BofA Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a note to clients.

Indian pharma cos well positioned for global growth: S&PIndian pharma cos well positioned for global growth: S&P

New Delhi/Singapore, Nov 12:  
As countries increasingly focus on affordable health care, the Indian pharmaceutical firms are well positioned for global growth, says a report by Global rating agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P).
The report titled “Indian Pharmaceutical Companies Have a Global Opportunity, If They Conquer Compliance Issues,” by S&P Ratings Services published today, however, said failure to comply with the stringent quality requirements in developed markets is a key factor.
““Expansion into developed markets, especially the U.S., is positive for the credit profiles of Indian pharmaceutical companies. The market’s size and the absence of price controls are likely to support the revenue growth and profitability,” Standard & Poor’s credit analyst Vishal Kulkarni said.
The growth prospects are particularly high for Indian companies in the speciality and complex generic drugs segment in the U.S., the report said.
However, failure on compliance with regulations could seriously hurt creditworthiness. It could lead to disruptions in production, import bans, remediation costs, and above all reputational and litigation risks, it added.
While the largest 10 Indian pharmaceutical companies are much smaller in terms of revenue than their global generics peers, they make up for it by their robust product pipeline, the report said.
“What the Indian companies lack in size is largely offset by their strong product pipeline, presence in emerging markets, and conservatively maintained financial health,” Kulkarni said in the report.

Chennai, Nov 12:  
On a day when European Space Agency (ESA) is attempting to place a robot Philae on Comet 67P/Churyumov—Gerasimenko, ISRO today released images of Comet Siding Spring , taken by its Mars Orbiter last month.
ISRO’s Mars Orbiter had the opportunity to witness the Comet Siding Spring approach Mars on October 19, for which the spacecraft repositioned itself for its safety. After the comet passed by, @MarsOrbiter tweeted, “Phew! Experience of a lifetime. Watched the MarsComet SidingSpring whizzing past the planet. I’m in my orbit, safe and sound.”
The Mars Colour Camera on board ISRO’s Mars Orbiter has captured the Coma (top bright portion) of the comet partly, as it approached MOM during last 40 minutes of the imaging session before Mars—Comet close encounter, ISRO said in its social networking site along with the pictures.
“Sequence of MCC images show the Coma move closure to MOM from 1.8 lakh to 1.3 lakh km between 17.44 to 18.25 UT on October 19,” it said.
Commenting on a streak radiating out of the comet’s nucleus, it said that jets usually represent out—gassing activity from vents of the comet—nucleus, releasing dust and ice crystals. “The outgassing activity gradually increases as the comet moves closure to the Sun,” it said.
As on 3 PM IST, ESA’s Rosetta — and her companion spacecraft — Philae — have parted ways, ahead of a historic landing on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov—Gerasimenko on Wednesday, according to ESA.
Philae is heading for a landing site named Agilkia, it said.

As Samsung falters  low key scion in the wingsSEOUL, South Korea, November 5, 2014
Updated: November 5, 2014 16:08 IST
As Samsung falters, low key scion in the wings
AP
PDAs and smartphones
As Samsung’s smartphone business suffers a dizzying decline, another issue is vexing investors.
Command of one of the world’s most valuable consumer brands will eventually pass to the son of its ailing patriarch whose business abilities remain a mystery despite being elevated two years ago to a top role at the company.
Expectations of a leadership shift at Samsung intensified after the chairman of the flagship company, Samsung Electronics Co., suffered a heart attack in May. Lee Kun-hee, 72, remains hospitalized and has never publicly named his only son, Lee Jae-yong, as heir apparent. But within the financial world and South Korea, where Samsung’s annual sales equal a quarter of the economy, there is little doubt he’ll be the third generation of the Lee family to head the sprawling business.
The 46-year-old was promoted to vice-chairman level in 2012 after joining the company in 1991. His increasing sway comes as Samsung’s rapid success with the smartphone product category pioneered by rival Apple Inc. is undergoing an equally stunning reversal. Earnings from Samsung’s smartphone business began declining this year, undermined by lukewarm sales of the Galaxy S5 smartphone and the competitive onslaught from cheaper Chinese brands.
“There is no information to know the track record of his leadership, his crisis management ability and how he carried out his business vision,” said Park Yoo-kyung of APG Asset Management Asia, a Dutch fund which is a Samsung investor. “When shareholders approve management during the shareholders meeting, they do not know the most important profile.”
The little that is known about Lee paints a picture of a privileged and rarified existence. Kim Yong-chul, Samsung’s former top lawyer, who authored a book exposing corruption at Samsung, wrote that Lee Jae-yong had little understanding about the lives of ordinary people and was not embarrassed by that.
A substantial part of his $4.7 billion fortune stems from access to shares in Samsung-affiliated companies before they went public. He has increasingly become a public face of Samsung, meeting people such as Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and China’s president Xi Jinping, but has never given an interview.
Samsung declined to comment on his role at the company.
South Korea’s media increasingly attributes big decisions at Samsung Electronics, the crown jewel of the Samsung empire, to Lee Jae-yong. His known business record, however, includes the failure of Samsung’s Internet ventures in 2000. He sold his stake to other Samsung affiliates a year later.
Smartphone troubles are the most obvious and immediate challenge for the Harvard-educated Lee Jae-yong. Earnings from Samsung’s mobile business plunged by nearly 75 percent last quarter as Chinese competitors such as Xiaomi wooed customers in developing nations. But there are other tests facing him.
Founded in 1938 by his grandfather Lee Byung-chull, Samsung bulked into an empire spanning washing machines to finance and semiconductors during an era when South Korea’s government gave cheap finance to companies in a rush to catch up with Japan and other developed nations. What mattered were results. How they were achieved was less important.
Even today, the group acts in ways that are frowned upon by investors and regulators.
Despite a minority shareholding, family control is maintained through a maze of cross-shareholdings in the 70 companies that make up the group. Neither Lee nor his father is part of the Samsung Electronics board of directors, the group of individuals with legal responsibility for the company’s decisions.
“I think that Lee is aware that he can’t manage the group in the same leadership style as his grandfather or his father,” said Kim Sang-jo, director of Solidarity for Economic Reform, a group that advocates stricter accountability for South Korea’s powerful conglomerates. “Rather than just meeting up with the Facebook CEO, he should have official rights and responsibility as a registered director at Samsung.”
Some attribute his low profile to South Korea’s culture of filial piety. Out of respect to the family patriarch, he may be reluctant to highlight his achievements at Samsung while his father is still at the helm. It also helps explain a puzzling phenomenon to outsiders - reports in the South Korean media extolling Lee Jae-yong’s vague achievements that rely on anonymous company sources.
An indication of change may come from how he deals with the legacy of his father’s conviction for embezzlement and tax evasion. He was given a suspended prison sentence and later pardoned.
One of the court’s findings was that Lee Kun-hee ensured his son got rich by issuing him securities in an IT services company, Samsung SDS, at much less than their value, causing losses to other shareholders.
Samsung’s de facto holding company Cheil Industries, which was involved in a similar court case over how Lee Jae-yong became a majority stakeholder, and Samsung SDS are set to go public in coming months. Critics say that the big profits Lee Jae-yong will reap should be a reminder of his larger responsibilities.
“He should show social responsibility by implementing an ownership structure and leadership that markets and the public can accept.”
Samsung critics say that means turning away from the past. But Lee Jae-yong might still gain inspiration from his father, who famously urged Samsung workers in a 1993 speech to transform the company at its most fundamental levels. “Change everything,” he said, “but wife and children.”

Gold jewellery  coins exports jump 22% in Apr-Septgold and precious material
Exports of gold jewellery, coins and medallions rose by 22 per cent to Rs 33,594 crore in the first half of this fiscal mainly due to RBI’s 80:20 scheme.
Under the 80:20 scheme, the Reserve Bank, in August last year, had allowed nominated agencies to import gold on the condition that 20 per cent of the import would be exported.
To boost value-added gold exports, RBI in May this year eased gold import norms by allowing select trading houses, in addition to already permitted banks, to procure the precious metal.
According to the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), the country exported gold jewellery and coins worth Rs 33,594 crore in April-September period this year, up by 22 per cent from Rs 27,551 crore in the year-ago period.
Of total gold exports, jewellery was worth Rs 27,530 crore and coins/medallions were worth Rs 6,064 crore in the review period.
However, the shipment of gold jewellery from Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as well as Export Processing Zones (EPZs) fell in the first half of the current financial year.
Gold jewellery worth Rs 11,299.67 crore was exported from SEZs and EPZs during April-September of this year, as against Rs 14,578.72 crore in the same period corresponding year.
In 2013-14 fiscal, the country had exported gold jewellery and coins worth Rs 70,000 crore.
India is the world’s largest gold consumer and meets its entire demand of almost 900 tonnes through imports.

Tribune Media reports lower third-quarter earnings0
Liguori cited several factors for the decline in core TV advertising: weakness in overall ad spending, political ads displacing some regular advertising, the elimination of "unprofitable sports programming" and "softness" in Fox Television's prime-time ratings. Tribune Media owns or operates 42 television stations and is the largest Fox affiliate station group.
With television revenues flat, Liguori went to great lengths during the call Tuesday to position Tribune Media as more than a local broadcast company.
"While we experienced declines in core advertising revenues, our business transformation and diversification strategy is beginning to show results," Liguori said. "As a percentage of overall revenues, core advertising from our local station group represented only 62 percent of our total consolidated revenues."
Tribune Media's real estate portfolio consists of 80 properties and some 8 million square feet of space, from the Times Mirror Square complex in Los Angeles to Tribune Tower and the Freedom Center printing facility in Chicago. The company generated more than $13 million in rental revenue during the third quarter, most of it from Tribune Publishing, which leases about 4.1 million square feet.
"We are managing these real estate assets for maximum cash flow, and with focus and purpose are pursuing development opportunities for some of our properties to realize maximum value over time," Liguori said.
The digital and data segment generated nearly $45 million in revenue during the quarter, up from about $19 million last year. Much of that revenue came from the February acquisition of music metadata company Gracenote. During the third quarter, Tribune Media pulled the plug on Newsbeat, a mobile app launched in March to provide audio streaming of newspaper stories, the company said.
WGN America remains integral to Tribune Media's long-term strategy. By January, WGN America will be about halfway toward converting from superstation to a full-fledged cable network, opening the door to increased distribution, ad revenue and affiliate fees from cable providers. The plan includes rolling out more original programming such as "Salem" and "Manhattan," while working to expand WGN America's reach to 90 million homes from 75 million over the next few years, Liguori said.
"We have a three- to five-year horizon to transform WGN America into a formidable general entertainment network," Liguori said.
The former Tribune Co. spun off its newspaper business, including the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, to focus on its higher-growth broadcasting and entertainment assets, as well as real estate holdings and equity investments. In September, Tribune Media filed registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for listing its stock on a major exchange. Tribune Media trades as an over-the-counter stock under the symbol TRBAA.
Executives on Tuesday said they expect Tribune Media to be listed on a major exchange by December, pending approval by the SEC.
Tribune Media has seen its stock price fall by about 30 percent since spinning off its publishing assets Aug. 4. Last month, the company authorized a $400 million stock repurchase program to be funded with existing cash balances. Tribune Media Chief Financial Officer Steven Berns said the stock repurchase can "commence shortly," and reiterated the reasons behind the move during Tuesday's call.
"We felt that the share price was low ... and did not represent full value," Berns said. "We think the share repurchase is a good first step."
Tribune Media has nearly 94 million outstanding shares of Class A stock. About 36 percent of outstanding Class A common stock is owned by Oaktree Capital Management; Angelo, Gordon & Co.; and JPMorgan Chase, the former senior creditors of Tribune Co., which emerged from bankruptcy at the end of 2012.
The stock was trading down more than 2 percent to $60.70 Tuesday morning.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accuses Israel of religious warPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel on Tuesday of leading the region toward a "religious war".
By: Associated Press | Ramallah | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:41 am
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel on Tuesday of leading the region toward a “religious war,” saying frequent visits by Jewish worshippers to a site sacred to both Islam and Judaism are fueling clashes that have raised fears of a widespread outbreak of fighting.
The accusation drew a sharp response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Abbas was making matters worse.
“Instead of calming tempers, he is inflaming them. Instead of educating his people for peace, Abu Mazen is educating them for terror attacks,” Netanyahu said in a nationally televised address, referring to Abbas.
After meeting his Security Cabinet for several hours, Netanyahu also said security forces had been bolstered, and that he would begin imposing tough measures against violent demonstrators.
Much of the recent unrest has stemmed from tensions surrounding the holy site in Jerusalem’s Old City known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.
Visits by Jewish worshippers have raised concerns among Muslims that Israel is secretly trying to take over the site, fanning strife in a region already on edge following the collapse of U.S.-led peace talks, Israel’s bloody war last summer in the Gaza Strip, and new Israeli settlement construction plans in east Jerusalem.
The tensions at the shrines have frequently boiled over into violent demonstrations and have provided the backdrop to a series of bloody attacks on Israelis by Palestinians.
In a fiery speech to thousands of supporters at his West Bank headquarters, Abbas said Israel was trying to divide the Jerusalem site, which includes the Al-Aqsa Mosque, much as it split a shared holy site in the West Bank city of Hebron after a Jewish settler gunned down 29 Muslim worshippers 29 years ago.
“Leaders of Israel are mistaken if they think they can divide the Al-Aqsa Mosque as they have done in Ibrahimi Mosque, and they will retreat from this one, too,” Abbas said.
“By dividing the mosques, they are leading us to a religious war, and no one — Muslim or Christian — will accept that Jerusalem be theirs,” Abbas said, urging Palestinians to defend the site. “Jerusalem is our capital, and there will be no concessions.”
Abbas’ speech marked the 10th anniversary of the death of Yasser Arafat, the longtime Palestinian leader and founder of the dominant Fatah faction.
He also used the occasion to attack the rival Hamas movement, accusing the Islamic militant group of undermining reconciliation efforts after a seven-year rift. The rivals agreed in June on the formation of a unity government, but Hamas, which overran Gaza in 2007, continues to control the territory.
Abbas accused Hamas of carrying out a series of bombings on the homes of Fatah leaders last week that led to the cancellation of what would have been the first Arafat memorial in Gaza since 2007. continued…

Fresh low in Andaman Sea may help break lull in N-E monsoonFresh ‘low’ in Andaman Sea may help break lull in N-E monsoon

Thiruvananthapuram, Nov 10:  
A fresh low-pressure area has formed over south Andaman Sea, an update by India Met Department said this afternoon. It is expected to strengthen a round and become well-marked by Tuesday.
Birth of the ‘low’ also meant the premature death of a persisting well-marked counterpart over west-central Bay of Bengal off the coast of Andhra Pradesh.
Remainder whirl
The sea-based could not make it to the coast. Only a remainder circulation hovered higher in the atmosphere above the sea, the Met said. The parent system was done in by the lower sea-surface temperatures nearer to the coast making for cool to cooler waters.
Cool water prevents evaporation from taking place and thus cuts off moisture feed into the system. Moisture is the fuel that makes the storm engine hum and sustains it. Also, wind shear values (sudden shifts in wind direction and strength with height) were tending to be high along the coast with a western disturbance approaching from the opposite direction.
Rains for TN
These conditions may prevent the new ‘low’ from achieving traction as a strong weather system. Indications are that the system may seek out warmer waters along the Sri Lankan coast for a landfall.
Thus, it may avoid the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh coasts where the waters have cooled down to negative values (less than threshold temperatures of 28 deg Celsius for systems to sustain).
But these coasts may expect rain or showers over the next couple days from the outer wind bands of the incoming weather system. The Met has forecast heavy rain along the Tamil Nadu coast and progressively into the interior tomorrow and day after.
Rains may grow over south coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema and north Tamil Nadu on Thursday and Friday. They may also extend to Karnataka and Madhya Maharashtra.
May break spell
The incoming spell of rain is expected to break the lull in the North-East monsoon rains during the last week when even the Tamil Nadu Met subdivision registered a deficit of 54 per cent.
The deficit is worse with neighbours – 99 per cent in north interior Karnataka; 97 per cent in south interior Karnataka; and 87 per cent in Rayalaseema. Kerala was relatively better off with a deficit of 24 per cent.
The rest of the country didn’t fare much better either with all-India deficit for the week ending on October 31 at 78 per cent. Even for the season (October 1 to November 5) for which statistics are available, the overall rain figures for the country tossed up a deficit 30 per cent.
Tamil Nadu provides an exception having recorded excess rainfall of 23 per cent. Kerala was next best with 16 per cent (classified as normal). The rest of peninsula is variously under deficit.

Delhi: Cops for closure of Kiran Bedi case; will BJP want her as CM pickComments
The Delhi Police crime branch has filed a closure report in a cheating case against Kiran Bedi. The development, coming as it does in the run-up to assembly elections, has triggered speculation of the former IPS officer joining the BJP.

Bedi, previously associated with AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, has voiced her support for the Narendra Modi government on Twitter and lauded his Swachh Bharat campaign. Before the December 2013 polls, a section of the BJP was said to be keen on making her the chief ministerial candidate.
The case against Bedi was filed in November 2011 when the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement, of which she was a part, was at its peak. She was accused of misusing funds donated by Microsoft to her trusts, India Vision Foundation and Navjyoti Foundation. She was also accused of buying computers for Rs. 50,000 each against an actual price of `20,000 when she was principal of the Police Training College. A city court then had ordered the registration of an FIR against her on charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy.
In the closure report, submitted to the court on October 28, the police have taken statements from Microsoft denying any embezzlement of funds by Bedi, sources said.
The investigating officer has also submitted a copy of audit reports from the Police Training College. These reports, the police said, state that all purchases were cleared and were aboveboard.   The closure report comes up in court later this month.
Contacted by HT, Bedi said Tuesday she wasn’t aware of the closure report but “glad to hear about it”. She added, “It was a matter of time for the report to be filed. No way did this case disturb me. I knew it had no substance.”

Fadnavis wins trust vote in Maharashtra assembly  Cong says BJP govt  illegitimateBJP government
(Adding to the confusion…)
MUMBAI: The Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in Maharashtra won the trust vote in the assembly on Wednesday, but the manner of its victory, secured through a controversial voice vote, drew condemnation from both Congress and erstwhile ally Shiv Sena. Both parties accused BJP of "murdering democracy" and described the government as "illegitimate".
Later in the evening, five Congress MLAs were suspended for allegedly attacking Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao. The day's events, some analysts said, cast doubts on the stability of the Fadnavis government.
The voice vote was passed amidst considerable drama. After BJP MLA from Bandra, Ashish Shelar, moved the trust motion, Speaker Haribhau Bagde called for a voice vote and then said the Fadnavis government had won the vote of confidence, even as Shiv Sena and Congress MLAs demanded that the motion be put to vote.
Adding to the confusion during the voice vote, Sena MLAs were demanding that their leader should be appointed the leader of the Opposition. All this happened in a matter of seconds. Speaker Bagde asserted that the confidence vote was conducted as per rules. He claimed that Congress and Sena MLAs had asked for a division (i.e. a vote on the floor of the assembly) too late.
"I asked those who say 'aye', say 'aye', those who say 'no', 'nay'. The Opposition asked for the division of votes only after I had pronounced that the 'ayes' had it. They (Congress and Sena) asked a little late. They should have asked (for a vote) at the very moment I said 'the ayes have it'," Bagde said.
Later in the evening, Fadnavis asserted that he had a majority and challenged the Opposition parties to move a vote of no-confidence. BJP has 121 MLAs and needed 145 to prove its majority. The Sharad Pawar-headed NCP, with 44 MLAs, is supporting the government from outside.
Enraged Congress and Sena leaders slammed the Speaker's move. "A confidence motion has never been passed by a voice vote. It's a black day for the democratic process in Maharashtra. This government is illegitimate until it proves its majority in the House by a division of votes," said Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan. The former CM said the BJP government should face a trust vote again and that Congress would meet the governor on the issue. Sena has 63 MLAs and Congress 41.
"This is a black day for Maharashtra. The people of the state have a right to know by how many votes BJP won and who voted for it," said Sena leader Ramdas Kadam. He claimed BJP resorted to a voice vote because it was not sure whether its own MLAs would vote for it as they didn't want Fadnavis as the chief minister. Political experts and lawyers were divided on the Speaker's move. Senior advocate MV Kini said a voice vote is not illegal. "Some manipulations may have been done.
However BJP is the single-largest party. Voice vote is an accepted form of expressing solidarity, it cannot be challenged as it is not illegal." Others were critical.
"Devendra Fadnavis is known as a promising man and otherwise a man of integrity, but his government has started by playing a fraud on parliamentary democracy. It is quite unfortunate and was easily avoidable. The people of Maharashtra have a right to know exactly how many MLAs were supporting the new Fadnavis government," said journalist and political analyst Pratap Thorat.
He added that he didn't see the Fadnavis government functioning for more than two years.
Senior advocate IG Khandelwal said he would file a PIL against the manner in which the trust vote was conducted. "It is totally unconstitutional and (an) abuse of the democractic process of the country. This is not acceptable, I am not in the city right now, but as soon as I return, I will be a filing a PIL against the way the trust vote was conducted."

CHENNAI: On a day when European Space Agency (ESA) is attempting to place a robot Philae on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, ISRO today released images of Comet Siding Spring, taken by its Mars Orbiter last month.
ISRO's Mars Orbiter had the opportunity to witness the Comet Siding Spring approach Mars on October 19, for which the spacecraft repositioned itself for its safety. After the comet passed by, @MarsOrbiter tweeted, "Phew! Experience of a lifetime. Watched the MarsComet SidingSpring whizzing past the planet. I'm in my orbit, safe and sound."
The Mars Colour Camera on board ISRO's Mars Orbiter has captured the Coma (top bright portion) of the comet partly, as it approached MOM during last 40 minutes of the imaging session before Mars-Comet close encounter, ISRO said in its social networking site along with the pictures.
"Sequence of MCC images show the Coma move closure to MOM from 1.8 lakh to 1.3 lakh km between 17.44 to 18.25 UT on October 19," it said.
Commenting on a streak radiating out of the comet's nucleus, it said that jets usually represent out-gassing activity from vents of the comet-nucleus, releasing dust and ice crystals. "The outgassing activity gradually increases as the comet moves closure to the Sun," it said.
As on 3 PM IST, ESA's Rosetta - and her companion spacecraft - Philae - have parted ways, ahead of a historic landing on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Wednesday, according to ESA. Philae is heading for a landing site named Agilkia, it said.

India  ASEAN can be great partners: ModiComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that India's relations with the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are very good and the two sides can be great partners.
"ASEAN and India have the vigour and enthusiasm of their youth and wisdom and understanding of their ancient civilisations," Modi said addressing the 25th ASEAN Summit in this capital of Myanmar.
"Rapidly developing India and ASEAN can be great partners for each other. We are both keen to enhance our cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region," he said.  
Stating that his government has been in office for six months, Modi said that India has rapidly enhanced its engagement with the east, "a reflection of the priority that we give to this region". 
"We have close bilateral relations with each of you and we treat the relations with ASEAN with the same importance," the prime minister said.
Stating that the 10-nation bloc has established its own identity and voice in global political and economic affairs, he said that the Asia-Pacific region needed integration and cooperation.
"To achieve this extremely important goal, we look at ASEAN, not only for inspiration but also for its leadership; and you have achieved a great deal of success in leading us in that direction," Modi said.
Describing the ASEAN community as India's neighbour, he said both sides have relations of trade, religion, culture, art and traditions that go back a long way.
Stating that the world view of the two sides is similar in many respects, Modi said: "We have no irritants in our relationship. We see encouraging opportunities and challenges in the world in similar ways."
Modi highlighted New Delhi's Look East Policy while remarking that the potential of India-ASEAN ties is much higher than what it is at the moment.
"A new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India. Externally, India's 'Look East Policy' has become 'Act East Policy'," Modi said.

Sensex ends above 2 800 to log new closing peakMarket update: Sensex ends above 28,000, Nifty touches 8,400-level

The BSE Sensex on Wednesday closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions. It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points.
It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in Tuesday's trade. A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours on Wednesday, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 per cent), Bajaj Auto (2.10 per cent), HDFC Ltd (1.12 per cent), SBI (0.17 per cent), ICICI Bank (1.33 per cent), HDFC Bank (0.44 per cent), ITC (1.55 per cent), Bharti Airtel (0.64 per cent), BHEL (0.88 per cent), Coal India (0.10 per cent), Dr Reddy's (0.58 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 per cent), Tata Motors (1.71 per cent) and TCS (0.55 per cent).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.

Cows milk can deliver AIDS drug toinfantsBy: Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: November 12, 2014 4:17 pm
A novel method of altering a protein in cow’s milk to bind with an antiretroviral drug promises to greatly improve treatment for infants and young children suffering from HIV/AIDS, according to a new study.
One of the most commonly prescribed antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection, Ritonavir, has undesirable side effects and important oral-delivery problems.
Its physicochemical properties challenge its administration to infants, said Federico Harte, associate professor of food science at Pennsylvania State University.
“Ritonavir has a high hydrophobicity and low solubility in water, which lead to a low dissolution rate in the gastrointestinal fluid and, hence, to insufficient bioavailability.
“The liquid formulation used to treat infants over one month of age contains 43 per cent ethanol and has an awful flavour that has been described as bitter-metallic, medicinal, astringent, sour and burning,” Harte said.
“Moreover, when coming into contact with the stomach mucosa, Ritonavir causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Therefore, we need to develop alternative paediatric formulations of Ritonavir and overcome its poor water solubility to improve its oral administration to infants and children,” added Harte.
To solve that problem, Harte looked to a group of proteins in cow’s milk celled caseins. Casein proteins form spherical aggregates called casein micelles, which are responsible, incidentally, for the white colour of milk.
The casein micelles in mammals’ milk are natural delivery systems for amino acids and calcium from mother to young, and might deliver Ritonavir molecules as well, Harte said.
“I have been working with bovine casein micelles for a few years now, and we have investigated the structure and functionality of these proteins,” he said.
“What we found is these micelles are able to carry molecules that have very little solubility in water, that have low molecular weight and that are very hydrophobic – such as Ritonavir,” said Harte.
Harte discovered that subjecting milk to ultrahigh-pressure homogenisation enhances the binding properties of the casein micelles.
Milk was homogenised at between 400 and 500 megapascals, disassociating the casein micelles and improving the protein’s binding qualities to attach to drug molecules.
An estimated 3.4 million children are living with HIV/AIDS, according to the World Health Organisation.
Nine out of 10 of them live in resource-limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where effective antiretroviral treatments still are not widely accessible or available, researchers said.
The research was published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
BSE Sensex and Nifty rose to record highs today, amid buying in rate-sensitive stocks ahead of the inflation data later in the day.
The Sensex ended 98 points higher to close above 28,000 for first time. During today's session, Sensex hit a new high of 28,126.48.
Nifty also hit the 8400 levels for the first time. It ended at a new-closing high of 8,383, up 20 points.
Traders are eyeing industrial production and inflation data to be released after market hours today. According to estimates, IIP rose a modest 0.8 per cent in September while consumer inflation in October fell to a record low of 5.67 per cent.
Indian markets have set a series of new highs since the third week of October, aided by strong foreign inflows and government's reform measures.
Foreign institutional investors have pumped in close to Rs 10,213 crore since October 20.
Bank stocks led the gains amid expectations that the RBI could cut rates earlier than expected. The Bank Nifty rose over 1 per cent. Axis Bank was the top Nifty gainer after rising over 3 per cent. Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank rose over 1 per cent.
Auto and real estate stocks also gained on expectations of rate cut. Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, DLF and Tata Motors rose between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent.
Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India Research at UBS Securities, said buying from domestic investors is keeping the market supported. Equity mutual funds saw sixth straight month of inflows in October. This takes the six-month total to Rs 39,000 crore, the largest ever for a six-month period.

Pakistan anti-terrorism court dismisses to hold Mumbai attacks trial byvideo-linkBy: Press Trust of India | Lahore | Posted: November 12, 2014 4:33 pm
A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Wednesday dismissed a plea to conduct the trial of seven accused in the 2008 Mumbai attacks case including LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi through video-link and asked authorities to ensure security for the witnesses and others.
Anti-Terrorism court Judge of Islamabad, Judge Kausar Abbas Zaidi, dismissed the prosecution’s plea to allow the witnesses to submit their recorded statements in the court because of security reasons.
“The court dismissed the prosecutions plea and ordered that the case hearing will continue to be held at the Adiala Jail at Rawalpindi and security be ensured for the witnesses and others,” the court sources told PTI.
Earlier before his transfer, Judge Attiquer Rehman had stopped holding the trial at Adiala Jail following “poor security arrangements” a few months ago.
“Owing to the security issues we request the court hold the trial through a video-link for their and witnesses security,” the prosecution lawyers pleaded.
The defence lawyers had argued against the prosecution’s plea saying “This is a sensitive and in-camera trial. The court proceedings will be accessible to many if it is allowed to be held through a video-link. How can the court trust witnesses statements in a CD form?”
“It can easily be tampered with and in no way will be admissible in the court. Therefore, the court should reject the prosecution’s plea,” they said.
Two witnesses – one from Federal Investigation Agency and other from foreign ministry – also appeared in the court, the sources said.
The foreign ministry official told the court about receiving the transcript of Ajmal Kasab statement from India and its submission to the FIA. The FIA official confirmed the receiving of the transcript.
Earlier, the prosecutors had drawn the court’s attention towards threats they received allegedly from the Jamaat-ud-Dawah activists.
The judge adjourned the hearing till November 19.
Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hamad Amin Sadiq, Shahid Jameel Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Anjum have been charged with planning, financing and executing the attacks in India’s financial capital that killed 166 people in November, 2008.

The Chhattisgarh High Court here on Wednesday sought a detailed report within ten days from the state government on the botched sterilisation surgeries in Bilaspur district, after it took suo moto cognisance of the the incident, which left 11 women dead and many critical.
The court has appointed two advocates– Salim Kazia and Sunita Jain– as amicus curiae (friend of the court) to assist it on the tragedy .
The division bench comprising Justice T P Sharma and Justice Inder Singh Uboweja took a serious note of the news reports on the death of 11 women after tubectomies at a government-organised sterilisation camp in Pedari village of Takhatpur block on Saturday, advocate Kazi told PTI.

Questioning the state government on why such incidents are repeatedly happening, the bench asked them to submit a detailed report on the sterilisation incident within 10 days before the court, Kazi said.
The court has also asked the government to provide best possible treatment to the affected women admitted in various hospitals and also take care of their relatives.

The court also asked the state government to apprise the amicus curiae on the day-to-day developments so that they can further brief the court, he said.
On November 8, about 83 women had undergone surgeries at a sterilisation camp held at Nemichand Jain Cancer and Research Centre at Pendari village in Takhatpur.
Later, almost all of them, aged below 32, were hospitalised after they developed post-operative complications.
While, 11 of them died in the past two days, 69 have taken ill and some are in critical condition.
A three-member committee has been constituted to investigate the incident even as four health officials including two senior doctors – Chief Medical and Health Officer of Bilaspur R K Bhange, laparoscopic surgeon Dr R K Gupta, State Programme Convener, family planning, Dr K C Urao and Block Medical Officer, Takhatpur, Dr Pramod Tiwari – were suspended in this connection.
An FIR has also been lodged against the surgeon under whose supervision the sterilisation camp was organised.
The state government has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to those undergoing treatment, the cost of which will be borne by the government.

Govt provides operational flexibility to oil cos | Fuel price cut likely by Nov 15Government provides operational flexibility to oil firms

(Operational flexibility…)
NEW DELHI: In a bid to make it easier to produce oil and gas, the government has notified a set of rules granting operational flexibility to firms like Cairn India and ONGC to start producing from several discoveries that are mired in contractual disputes.
The Petroleum Ministry in a notification relaxed rigid timelines prescribed in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for development and production of oil and gas.
"The Government of India hereby notifies Policy Framework for Relaxations, Extension and Clarifications at the Development and Production Stage under the PSC regime for early monetisation of hydrocarbon discoveries," the order said.
Operational flexibility has been provided in enforcing contracts by way of relaxing some of timelines prescribed for discoveries so that E&P activities do not suffer on account of excessive rigidity in decision making.
The PSC between the government and the explorer has rigid timelines for each stage of exploration and actions have been initiated against firms even if deadlines are missed by a day.
The notification said 3-6 months extension in the current 18-60 month timeframe for submission of declaration of commerciality (DoC) of discoveries, a prerequisite before investment plans can be finalised, can be given.
Also, the deadline for submission of investment plan for the discoveries too would be extended by up to six months.
The PSC provides for time period for submission of field development plan (FDP) for hydrocarbon discovery after DOC. There is no provision in the PSC for extension of this time period and non-acceptance of FDP due to late submission results in non-monetisation of discoveries.
Also, upstream regulator DGH has been given flexibility to accept discoveries for which operators had failed to provide prior notification to the government.
The notification also provided for reduction in committed work programme in case a block or its part is not available for exploration activities consequent to denial of permission by government agencies.
Reduction of minimum work programme (MWP) will be considered in case of "blocks overlapping with Special Economic Zone (SEZ), reserve forest, naval exercise areas, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) danger zones, National Parks, urban areas and firing ranges of police/armed forces," it said.
Currently, discoveries, mostly of Cairn, ONGC and GSPC are stuck because of lack of flexibility in timelines. These include 10 finds of Cairn in Rajasthan which have not been endorsed by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).
Besides FDP approvals for more than two dozen finds are held up for some or the other reason. Fifteen discoveries lie abandoned in areas that have been relinquished by operators.

Being richest is 'great pain': Alibaba founder Jack Ma
AFP Nov 12, 2014, 04.20PM IST
(Ma has seen his fortune balloon…)
SHANGHAI: He may now be China's richest man but Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, has admitted in a US television interview that being so wealthy is actually causing him "great pain".
Ma has seen his fortune balloon to $19.5 billion after Alibaba's record-breaking $25 billion initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in September, according to data compiled by Forbes magazine.
On Tuesday, the company chalked up a new record -- $9.3 billion of sales conducted through its platforms during Singles Day, its 24-hour shopping promotion and the world's biggest online retail event.
But a successful stock listing and vast fortunes have caused him stress, Ma said in an interview with US business news channel CNBC Tuesday.
"This month I'm not very happy -- I think too much pressure," Ma told the broadcaster.
"Maybe the stock goes so up, maybe people have high expectations on you, maybe I think too much about the future and have too many things to worry about," he said.
Alibaba's share price has been on a steady uptrend since it debuted in New York two months ago. It closed at $114.54 on Tuesday, representing a nearly 70 percent gain from its offer price of $68.
Ma said that people often tell him that being rich "is good" but admitted he found being the wealthiest man in China difficult.
"Yeah, it is good, but not the richest man in China. It's a great pain because when you're (the) richest person in the world, everybody (is) surrounding you for money," Ma told CNBC.
He added that people now looked at him differently when he walked down the street and added: "spending money is much more difficult than making money."
His remarks echoed what he told state media in early October when he said being named China's richest man is "meaningless".
"My happiest days were when I used to earn 90 yuan ($15) a month," Ma once told state media.
He is looking at the possibility to establish a foundation to spend money "in a business way" and may even compete with US billionaire Bill Gates in the field of philanthropy, according to CNBC.
Ma was ranked as China's most generous person after he donated a 1.4 per cent stake in his firm to set up a charity focused on the environment, health care and education, according to a survey by wealth publisher Hurun in late October.

Maharashtra: Sena  Cong slam controversial floor test  speaker says he went by rulesThe BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra won a crucial confidence motion on Wednesday through a voice vote that the Shiv Sena described as “strangling democracy” and the Congress called “a black day”.
 
The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member assembly, passed the test to prove its majority through a simple “Aye” from legislators supporting the 13-day-old minority government, though their voice got muffled in the din raised by the Shiv Sena and the Congress.
 
Speaker Haribhau Bagde suspended five Congress legislators for two years after they allegedly heckled governor C Vidyasagar Rao who was injured in the melee as protests inside and outside the assembly turned ugly.
 
The BJP government needed to prove its majority because it was 22 short of the halfway mark in the assembly. Having snapped its 25-year alliance with the Shiv Sena, it didn’t have the 63 MLAs of its former ally to bail it out.
 
Bagde, who was elected unopposed earlier in the day, called the voice vote valid and rejected the opposition’s demand for a poll.
 
“The house should be run as per rules and the Constitution should not be trampled upon. The new government is strangling democracy. We sought division but the trust motion was passed by voice vote,” said opposition leader Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena.
 
The Congress questioned the legitimacy of the trust vote and said it would approach the governor with the request to ask the Fadnavis government to prove its majority by a poll.
 
“This is the darkest day in the history of the Maharashtra assembly. We will not allow the house to function under this minority government,” said former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan.
 
Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam said the BJP government’s act was against the spirit of the Constitution and threatened to take legal recourse. “Vidhan Sabha stands tarnished today. A division would have made it clear whether they have the support of the majority of MLAs. The confidence motion has not been passed.”
 
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Bagde rubbished the opposition’s claims, saying due process was followed.
 
"Congress and Shiv Sena did not ask for a poll (division of votes) at the appropriate time. Since Congress has always been in power it has forgotten the rules about when to ask for division of votes,” Fadnavis told reporters
 
All this while MLAs of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which had committed its support to the Fadnavis government, sat quietly and watched the opposition demand a division. The division of votes, which according to convention is held with legislators voting for or against a motion, was ruled out by the Speaker.
 
The BJP had said it had direct and indirect support of 140 MLAs but needed some legislators to vote for it or abstain in the event of a poll.
 
Since there was no clarity on which way the NCP voted, the speaker’s move was seen as an attempt to save the BJP the embarrassment of publicly going along with Sharad Pawar’s party that has 41 MLAs, sources said.
 
Despite the day’s developments, the BJP indicated in the evening that it was still open to an alliance with the Sena. Fadnavis told HT that he has plans to expand his cabinet before the winter session of the legislature begins in Nagpur on December 8.

Ahead of the Bell: US Wholesale Inventories... 
October 9, 2014 06:38 AM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Commerce Department reports on wholesale stockpiles and sales in August. The report will be issued at 10 a.m. Eastern Thursday.
STOCKPILES AND SALES UP: Economists forecast that sales at the wholesale level rose 0.4 percent in August, according to a survey by FactSet. An increase in stockpiles that would reflect the strength in sales is also likely.
SLOWER RESTOCKING: In July, U.S. wholesalers restocked their warehouses at the slowest pace in a year, boosting inventories by just 0.1 percent. Sales, meanwhile, jumped 0.7 percent.
The strong sales growth suggests companies will have to restock their shelves at a faster pace to keep up with demand. More restocking of goods lifts factory production and boosts economic growth.
Inventory growth is viewed as a barometer of business sentiment. When companies add goods to their stockpiles, it shows optimism about future demand. A cutback in inventories can be a sign that businesses are concerned about a potential economic slowdown and don't want to be stuck with unsold goods.
In the April-June quarter, faster inventory building by retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers and other businesses accounted for 1.4 percentage points of the 4.6 percent annual growth rate.
That followed a big cutback in restocking in the first three months of the year, which subtracted nearly 1.2 percentage points from growth. The economy contracted 2.1 percent in the January-March quarter, the worst showing since the recession ended in mid-2009.

Doritos-Flavored Mountain Dew Is Realreddit
PepsiCo Inc. is concocting a version of its Mountain Dew soda flavored to taste like cheesy Doritos chips, the company stated Friday.
The soda and snack giant said it tested the new flavor, dubbed “Dewitos,” on college students. The company did not reveal which colleges participated in the test, but at least one Reddit user, who goes by the username joes_nipples , posted a photo of the taste test on Friday, saying the soda did, in fact, taste like Doritos.
“We are always testing out new flavors of Mountain Dew, and giving our fans a voice in helping decide on the next new product has always been important to us,” a spokeswoman for PepsiCo said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “We opened up the DEW flavor vault and gave students a chance to try this Doritos-inspired flavor as part of a small program at colleges and universities.”
This isn't the first time PepsiCo has combined the highly caffeinated soda and the cheese-dusted nacho chips. PepsiCo also owns Frito-Lay, which makes Doritos, and the company has a long history of linking the two brands through new flavors or joint promotions. In 2008, PepsiCo released Doritos Quest , a sweet chip with a mystery flavor that was later identified as Mountain Dew.
The company has also long promoted Doritos and Mountain Dew, together enshrined in video gaming culture as the ultimate snacking cuisine, in marketing campaigns promoting the release of games on Microsoft’s Xbox.
Earlier this year, PepsiCo began printing special codes on bottles of Mountain Dew and bags of Doritos that can be used to unlock gear and increase experience points in “Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,” which was released this week.
It’s unclear whether the Doritos-flavored soda will ever reach store shelves. But there's evidence to suggest that the Doritos and Mountain Dew combination is popular: In June, YouTube chef Rosanna Pansino introduced the world to Mountain Dew-flavored cupcakes topped with a Doritos crumble. And interest in the two brands, as shown by this Google Trends graph, seems to be on the rise:

The New York egg-freezing party reproduces itself in Silicon Valleyvia @eggfreezeparty
"I thought it would be a fun way to promote fertility awareness before it’s too late," Eyvazzadeh, who is a reproductive endocrinologist, told the San Francisco Chronicle .
Women who attend her parties -- she's planned a trio of them for interested women who want to stop by after work -- get a 10 percent discount should they decide to spend the roughly $15,000 it costs to freeze and store one's eggs.
Women who host one of their own egg-freezing parties get an even larger discount. One such party  carries a $20 entry fee .
The offers, as the Chronicle notes, could pair well with some of the benefits offered by some of the high-powered Silicon Valley employers in the area. Apple will start covering egg freezing next year, telling the paper in a statement: "We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families." Facebook already offers $20,000 in coverage for several fertility-related procedures.
The parties even have their own Twitter account:
Everything You Wanted to Know About Egg Freezing http://t.co/sgVor6dacf via @voguemagazine
While the parties might be new to San Francisco, they originated in New York.  EggBanxx threw a "Let's chill!" party  in September at the very fancy Crosby Street Hotel.
Slate described the follow-up marketing aimed at women who attended that party:
Since the mid-September event, company “patient advocates” have aggressively emailed the women who attended, offering special financing plans and a $500 discount for signing up by the end of the month. “Hoping to help you chill and have no regrets!” went a typical follow-up email. “The future you will thank you!
The article points to a 2013 piece from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine that cautions against "marketing this technology for the purpose of deferring childbearing ... there is concern regarding the success rates in women in the late reproductive years who may be the most interested in this application." The ASRM stopped calling the procedure "experimental" that same year.
But it's easy to see why companies marketing the procedure to busy, well-to-do women might think these happy hours are potentially effective marketing tools.
In a much more innocent time in my life, I went to a Longaberger party while staying with a nice, middle-age couple in Maine. Based on that experience, I know that a Longaberger party involves cake, soda, coffee and lots of Longaberger baskets for sale. I had a good time! But I did not buy any baskets.
Longaberger parties are what happen when the Tupperware party market is saturated, but a woven basket shortage remains. The parties are so out of fashion these days that there is an  entire forum on QVC.com from 2012 discussing how passe the parties -- and the baskets -- are.
I haven't been to an egg-freezing party. But based on my extensive Longaberger party experience, I can conclude that an egg-freezing party is a Longaberger party, but with much wealthier women, and alcohol. Oh, and the host is trying to sell you a surgery that requires several preparatory hormone injections, and not a basket or another vaguely yonic vessel, like Tupperware.
As Citylab notes , most health insurance companies treat egg freezing as an elective procedure, implying that only the quite well-off would be able to purchase what these parties are selling. Which, again, is a surgical procedure.

Editorial: Dressing For SuccessLetters to  the editor
Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg was recently asked why he wore grey T-shirts almost every day. His answer was that he had no time to waste in deciding what to wear every morning. The late Steve Jobs too was always seen in a black turtleneck top. People are judged by the way they dress and look. In the corporate world, the formally dressed are perceived as more successful and bright. A study published in Evolution and Human Behavior found that when wearing ‘high-status clothing’, people scored higher in job recommendations and salary.
Similarly, participants in a study rated a man interviewing for a job as better-suited for the job when he wore something with a designer logo than when he didn’t. The researchers explain that designer labels communicate underlying quality—the subconscious thought is that only the best can afford them; so this person must be among the best. What is it about clothing that has such a profound impact on perceptions? Those in the media—barring television anchors—opt for smart casual. New age corporate executives will often shed ties when not meeting clients while bankers always favour three-piece suits. This is not to say that formal is always better. Dressing casually can cut stress and increase collaborative activity. Zuckerberg may have got it right.

Skopje set to junk deal with Subrata Roy s Sahara  invokes 3 mn guaranteeEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
In a fresh setback to jailed Sahara Group chairman Subrata Roy Sahara, the Macedonian Ministry of Agriculture has begun the process of cancelling an agreement with Sahara to reorganise the Dzumajlija agricultural complex, and activated a 3 million-euro bank guarantee that the group had given to the government in Skopje.
News portal macedoniaonline.eu quoted Sonja Trajkova, spokesperson for the ministry, as having said Saturday: “The Ministry will strictly follow the agreement that was signed. We have said so at several meetings we had with Sahara before we decided to activate the bank guarantee.”
Macedoniaonline added that the activation of Sahara’s bank guarantee was the “first step toward the cancellation of the entire agreement”.
According to the agreement finalised in July last year, Sahara was to develop a 5,500-hectare Dzumajlija farming complex near the city of Sveti Nikole. The Group had announced four separate state-of-the-art dairy farms, as well as facilities for fodder production, to be built over three years.
In response to questions sent by The Indian Express, a Sahara spokesperson said, “As far as the decision taken regarding the bank guarantee is concerned, we feel that it will have negative impact on this mega project which happens to be in the early stage of execution. We can understand why the Macedonian government took this step and we are prepared for the consequences… Macedonia is an important focus point for our offshore business and we are happy to partner with the fast developing country. We are working to arrive at amicable solutions to some specific queries of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water supply; we are confident that it will get resolved.”
Dzumajlija, a troubled farming company which, besides producing grain, also has a winery, dairy plant and a host of other facilities, was leased to Sahara in July last year for EUR 1,21,000 per month. Sahara undertook to hire 900 workers, invest EUR 60 million, and expand the cattle stock by 8,000 cows. The plans for Dzumajlija included large-scale milk and cattle feed production, and exports to Balkan, Middle Eastern and North African countries.
Subrata Roy made three trips to Macedonia in January, July and October last year, and announced big plans for the country —  including an investment of EUR 2.7 billion in businesses in the next five years, building a Macedonian ‘Las Vegas’, and bringing 20,000 cows into the country.
Roy has been in Tihar jail since March 4 after Sahara failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s order to return Rs 24,000 crore to investors.

Bird hits Ahmedabad-Mumbai flight carrying 116 passengersEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
A Mumbai-bound GoAir plane, carrying 116 passengers, landed under emergency conditions at the city airport yesterday, after a bird hit it minutes after its take-off, an airport official said.
“An Ahmedabad to Mumbai GoAir flight number 368, carrying 116 passengers, made an emergency landing due to a bird hit, after it took off from the city airport,” Acting Director of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport S P Pandey told PTI.
Pandey said all the passengers and crew-members are safe and were provided with an alternative flight to Mumbai.
The incident occurred after the flight took off at 9.15 am when it was at a height of around 300 feet, he said.
The bird-hit damaged the engine of the GoAir aircraft, which is being repaired, Pandey said.
Last week, a Delhi-bound SpiceJet plane with around 140 passengers on board had hit a stray buffalo on the runway while rolling for take-off from Surat airport.

Over 5 000 Anganwadi schools in Gujarat lack toilets: CAGLetters to  the editor
A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, tabled before the Gujarat Assembly today, notes that more than 5,000 Anganwadi centers in the state did not have toilets as of the last year.
The BJP government tabled the audit report on local bodies for the year ended on March 2013 today, the last day of the legislature’s session.
The performance audit of ‘total sanitation campaign’ was conducted for the period 2008-2013, it said.
The campaign, launched by the Centre in 1999, was renamed as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan in 2012. The CAG report noted several deficiencies in its implementation in rural parts of Gujarat.
The scheme provides for construction of toilets at Anganwadis (government-run nursery or primary schools). As per the target set by the
Gujarat government, 22,505 Anganwadi toilets (ATs) were to be constructed by March 2009. It was later revised to 30,516 in April 2012.
“Against the overall target of 30,516 ATs, the achievement was 25,422 (83 per cent) as of March 2013. The position in Jamnagar was low and achievement was only 47 per cent. Resultantly, children of Anganwadis continued to be deprived of a basic amenity,” said the CAG report.
Incidentally, yesterday the Gujarat Assembly passed a Bill making having a toilet at home a pre-requisite for contesting the local body polls.

Sensex ends above 28K in a first; more steam leftBSE sensex
(Most analysts expect the…)
NEW DELHI: After rallying over 200 points in intraday trade, the Sensex lost momentum in late trade, but enthused investors as it closed above the crucial 28,000-mark.
The Sensex closed the day at 28,008.9, up 98.84 points. The Nifty ended the day at 8,383.30, up 20.6 points.
What lies ahead? Analysts say we should not expect a big-bang rally in 2015.
Benchmark indices, namely the Sensex & the Nifty, have rallied over 32 per cent so far in the year 2014, but a similar performance next year might be a little difficult as a lot of positives are already being factored in the price, say analysts.
India has been the top beneficiary of strong foreign flows when compared with other emerging market peers, largely on account of strong macros, stable currency and the Modi factor.
Most analysts expect the market to rally probably by 10 per cent to 15 per cent, while some even expect a negative or flat return for the year 2015.
"Eyeing a 20 per cent return in the next 12 months is far too optimistic and you are absolutely right in saying that India has been one of the top performing markets this year. Year-to-date the Sensex is well above 30 per cent," says Robert Parker, Senior Advisor, Credit Suisse.
"The upside in the Indian market, taking a 12-months view, is probably limited to a further 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Having said that, I reiterate my positive outlook for the Indian economy," he adds.
On Tuesday, global investment bank UBS recommended a target of 9,600 on the Nifty by end-2015, which presents an upside of nearly 15 per cent from current levels. That is half of what the markets delivered in the year 2014.
They remain bullish on Indian equities for the year 2015 considering the fact that the economic growth recovery is underway, which will sustain current valuations.
Unlike the last three years, UBS expects FY16 and FY17 earnings growth estimates of over 15 per cent to be met. The Nifty target of 9,600 is based on top-down expectation of 15 per cent earnings growth in FY16E and 18 per cent growth in FY17E (on a base of 13% in FY15E), explains UBS.
The S&P BSE Sensex rallied to 28,000 for the first time last week and is well on its way to touch 30k by the end of this year, and probably 35000 by December 2015, which only provides an upside of 25 per cent from current levels
According to an ET Now survey of 15 brokerage firms, conducted last month, reveals that most analysts are eyeing a level of 30000-35000 in the next 12 months.
As per the poll, 33 per cent of respondents are of the view that the Sensex could see the levels above 35000 in the next 12 months, while 50 per cent or majority of the respondents see the index trading in the range of 30000-35000. And, only 17 per cent of the respondents see the index hovering in the range of 26000-30000.
The government is making the right noises, moving the right levers, albeit a little slowly, but very-very steadily. But achieving a growth rate of over 6 per cent may take a while.
"Unlike what most market participants would like to believe, running a country is a little different from running the markets. So it is going to take a while to change," says Dipen Sheth, Head-Institutional Research, HDFC Securities.
"It is a huge country. We keep on talking of 125 crore people or what have you, and to get things to steer this big ship around is a little different from taking a quick U-turn on a scooter. We want to see everyday excitement on our screens and that is not going to happen," he adds.
There are some experts who think that the present momentum may not continue for long or in the next year, as the Reserve Bank of India may take a while before it starts cutting rates and the US may well hike interest rates, which would put some bit of pressure on the emerging markets, including India.
"Momentum may not continue as interest rates are going to be raised in the US next year. The RBI is not going to cut rates before FY16. So we can expect significant volatility," says Yogesh Nagaonkar, VP-Institutional Equities, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
"The Nifty can give no or negative returns in the next 1 year," he says, adding that the Budget will be the next big trigger for the Indian markets, and if the next Budget fails to live up to the expectations of the market (implementing key reforms such as GST ), then the market will react negatively.
Markets running ahead of fundamentals?
Most economists across brokerages feel that the economy has bottomed out, but will take time to pick up. With factors turning favourable, the growth is expected to gain momentum in FY16.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has lowered India's growth forecast to 5.4 per cent from 5.7 per cent estimated earlier for the current year, it expects the Indian economy to expand 6.4 per cent next year compared with 5.9 per cent estimated less than two months back in its September'14 interim outlook.
"In terms of underlying economic activity - whether it is credit off-take, auto sales or earnings numbers- it is clear that the economy has not really turned meaningfully," says Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO-Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital.
"My reading is that the second quarter growth will come in well below the Q1 number of 5.7 per cent. We are looking at a number closer to 5%. So there is a concern that the economy has not actually turned in a significant way," he adds.
Mukherjea is of the view that this is a slow recovery and it will take time to overcome the fundamental issues of the economy. The best way to make profit it is buy good-quality names, which will stand the test of time, because you will need to be patient to make money in India, he adds.

A lot of "good ground work" has been covered, post Obama-Modi meet in the US, and now is the execution time, with infrastructure going to be the focus of the Indo-US commerce ties, a top official has said.
"In the joint statement, one of the big focus areas is infrastructure sector," Arun M Kumar, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the US and Foreign Commercial Service in the US Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, said.
He was referring to the India-US joint statement issued after the September 30 meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Barack Obama .
There is an "enthusiastic" response from the US companies, he noted. Appreciative of the steps being taken by the new Indian government in "improving" the business climate in the country, he said, there were a lot of areas where improvement are required. Land acquisition is one of them, he said.
"We have seen determination (by the new government) to move forward. We definitely want to build the momentum of our interaction with the new Indian Government in the last few months," he said.
The September visit of Modi to the US and his meeting with Obama at the White House, he said, was very successful.
"We are ready to engage," Kumar said.
"We are very excited about the infrastructure collaboration," he added.
"I think, we have covered a lot of good ground work. Now it is execution time," he said.
American companies have a lot of good technologies and practices to offer in the infrastructure sector, said Kumar who is now headed for his third trip to India, the last one was along with the New Delhi visit of the Secretary of State John Kerry and the Commerce Secretary, Penny Pritzker.
He was one of the first few top US officials to visited India after the formation of the Modi Government.
The Commerce Department is expected to play a key role in Indo-US ties now that Modi-Obama meeting agreed to take their bilateral business and trade ties to $500 billion from the current $100 billion.
"It is doable and achievable. We have just scratched the surface of our bilateral trade potential," he said in response to a question, adding that this needs a lot of action, simplification of various areas of investment, improvement in ease of doing business.

Markets on a roll: BSE Sensex ends above 28K  NSE Nifty at newpeakPrint
BSE Sensex today closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time. (Reuters)
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 4:50 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 4:51 pm
The BSE Sensex today closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions.
It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points. It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in yesterday’s trade.
A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours today, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 pc), Bajaj Auto (2.10 pc), HDFC Ltd (1.12 pc), SBI (0.17 pc), ICICI Bank (1.33 pc), HDFC Bank (0.44 pc), ITC Ltd (1.55 pc), Bharti Airtel (0.64 pc), BHEL (0.88 pc), Coal India (0.10 pc), Dr Reddy (0.58 pc), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 pc), Tata Motors (1.71 pc) and TCS (0.55 pc).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.

No invite to PM Narendra Modi: Naidu accuses Cong of small-mindednessSources said that Congress will not invite any leader of BJP and its allies for the event.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 4:46 pm
Hitting out at Congress for not inviting PM Modi to an event to mark Jawaharlal Nehru’s birth anniversary, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said it shows the “small- mindedness of the party and its leadership”.
“Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India and Modi is the current Prime Minister. I am amused by the decision of the Congress to not invite Modi to the conference on Nehru when it is inviting leaders from various other countries,” Naidu said here on the sidelines of the inauguration of the Vivekananda Shelter for Homeless at Rohini.
“It only reflects the small-mindedness of the Congress party and its leadership. I am also amused by the reason given by Congress for not inviting the PM, that Modi did not believe in Nehru’s ideology,” he said, adding that “the decision of the Congress party only amused me, though it is not a surprise”.
Sources in Congress have said that no leader of BJP or its allies would be invited to a two-day international conference to be held here on Nov. 17 and 18 which aims to highlight the legacy and worldview of Nehru. The event will be attended by a host of international leaders and representatives of various political parties from India and abroad.
Taking exception to Congress’ decision, Naidu said, “Leaders of different parties may have different thinking and ideologies. But prime ministers, whether past or present, are national leaders and should be seen as such rather than citing ideological differences.”

Pakistan anti-terrorism court dismisses to hold Mumbai attacks trial by video-linkBy: Press Trust of India | Lahore | Posted: November 12, 2014 4:33 pm
A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Wednesday dismissed a plea to conduct the trial of seven accused in the 2008 Mumbai attacks case including LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi through video-link and asked authorities to ensure security for the witnesses and others.
Anti-Terrorism court Judge of Islamabad, Judge Kausar Abbas Zaidi, dismissed the prosecution’s plea to allow the witnesses to submit their recorded statements in the court because of security reasons.
“The court dismissed the prosecutions plea and ordered that the case hearing will continue to be held at the Adiala Jail at Rawalpindi and security be ensured for the witnesses and others,” the court sources told PTI.
Earlier before his transfer, Judge Attiquer Rehman had stopped holding the trial at Adiala Jail following “poor security arrangements” a few months ago.
“Owing to the security issues we request the court hold the trial through a video-link for their and witnesses security,” the prosecution lawyers pleaded.
The defence lawyers had argued against the prosecution’s plea saying “This is a sensitive and in-camera trial. The court proceedings will be accessible to many if it is allowed to be held through a video-link. How can the court trust witnesses statements in a CD form?”
“It can easily be tampered with and in no way will be admissible in the court. Therefore, the court should reject the prosecution’s plea,” they said.
Two witnesses – one from Federal Investigation Agency and other from foreign ministry – also appeared in the court, the sources said.
The foreign ministry official told the court about receiving the transcript of Ajmal Kasab statement from India and its submission to the FIA. The FIA official confirmed the receiving of the transcript.
Earlier, the prosecutors had drawn the court’s attention towards threats they received allegedly from the Jamaat-ud-Dawah activists.
The judge adjourned the hearing till November 19.
Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hamad Amin Sadiq, Shahid Jameel Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Anjum have been charged with planning, financing and executing the attacks in India’s financial capital that killed 166 people in November, 2008.

Pharma companies well positioned for global growth: S&P
PTI Nov 12, 2014, 04.27PM IST
(The growth prospects are…)
NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE: As countries increasingly focus on affordable health care, the Indian pharmaceutical firms are well positioned for global growth, says a report by Global rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P).
The report titled "Indian Pharmaceutical Companies Have A Global Opportunity, If They Conquer Compliance Issues," by S&P Ratings Services published today, however, said failure to comply with the stringent quality requirements in developed markets is a key factor.
""Expansion into developed markets, especially the US, is positive for the credit profiles of Indian pharmaceutical companies. The market's size and the absence of price controls are likely to support the revenue growth and profitability," Standard & Poor's credit analyst Vishal Kulkarni said.
The growth prospects are particularly high for Indian companies in the speciality and complex generic drugs segment in the US, the report said.
However, failure on compliance with regulations could seriously hurt creditworthiness. It could lead to disruptions in production, import bans, remediation costs, and above all reputational and litigation risks, it added.
While the largest 10 Indian pharmaceutical companies are much smaller in terms of revenue than their global generics peers, they make up for it by their robust product pipeline, the report said.
"What the Indian companies lack in size is largely offset by their strong product pipeline, presence in emerging markets, and conservatively maintained financial health," Kulkarni said in the report.

PM Modi invites ASEAN nations to invest in IndiaPM Modi invites ASEAN to be part of India's new economic journey

Asserting that the country and ASEAN have "no irritants" in their ties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday invited the 10-nation bloc to be part of the country's "new" economic journey even as his strong 'Make in India' pitch got the support of the grouping.
Modi in his interaction in Hindi at the round table said that a "new era" of economic development, industrialisation and trade had begun in the country and that the rapidly developing country and ASEAN can be "great partners" for each other.
Noting that the government's 'Look East' policy has become 'Act East' policy, the Prime Minister assured the ASEAN leaders that he will give his "sustained personal" attention to the country's relations with the regional bloc.
"We have embarked on a new economic journey in India, we invite you to this new environment in India," Modi said. ASEAN plans to become one economic community by the end of 2015.
The prime minister's comments came at a time when the government seeks to deepen its engagement with the bloc of 10 small and medium economies.
At the same time, Modi said the potential for India-ASEAN ties is much higher than where they stand at the moment.
Presently, India-ASEAN trade is around US $76 billion which is just three per cent of total ASEAN trade. They have set a target of US $100 billion for bilateral trade by 2015.
The Prime Minister noted that both India and ASEAN are keen to enhance their cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region.
"My government has been in office for six months and the intensity and momentum with which we have enhanced our engagement in the East, is a reflection of the priority that we give to this region," Modi said at the summit held at the sprawling Myanmar International Convention Centre on the second day of his 10-day tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
The Prime Minister also said that in this age more than physical connectivity there was a need for information highways or i-ways.
Besides having an interaction with the ASEAN leaders at the Round Table, Modi also met them for separate bilateral meetings during which his flagship 'Make in India' campaign found resonance.
"I fully agree and admire the concept of the ' Make in India ' campaign. It can drive the economy. Thailand can apply it for its economy too," Modi's Twitter handle quoted the Thai Premier Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha as having told him.
The campaign also figured during the premier's interaction with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak.
"I am giving (a) lot of emphasis to Make in India and want to invite Malaysian companies to come to India. There are lot of opportunities," Modi tweeted after the meeting.
At another meeting, the Prime Minister's Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong told him that there is lot of goodwill for the country in the ASEAN.
ASEAN comprises of 10 countries - Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Surat airport director transferred toAssamPrint
By: Express News Service | Surat | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:20 pm
The Airports Authority of India transferred Surat airport director SD Sharma to Lilabari airport (North Lakhimpur) in Assam because of the buffalo hit incident on Thursday last.  Pramod Thakre airport director of Bhavnagar had been posted at Surat airport, from Wednesday.
A Delhi-bound the SpiceJet aircraft carrying over 140 passengers from Mumbai and Surat, ran into a buffalo just before take off, damaging the aircraft badly and grounding it, even as the passengers escaped.
The buffalo died damaging the engine section of the plane. Another flight was called from Mumbai to Surat to take passengers to Delhi even as SpiceJet indefinitely suspended all flights from Surat.
Following the incident, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (Western Region) A K Sharma arrived with his team members and toured the periphery of Surat Airport and found that the fencing put up in place of the collapsed boundary wall, also had broken at several places, leaving channels open for cattle to sneak in and graze. Also, the runway did not have enough lights for the pilot to see the buffalo. The team members failed to get satisfactory answers from the Surat airport director S D Sharma.
, following which the transfer orders came.
Talking to the Indian Express Surat airport director S D Sharma said, “It was good working in Surat and I tried to put  all the efforts in my work at Surat. I know the reason behind my transfer but I have learnt a lot from my experience in Surat.”

HTC Desire 816 G review: Consider this only if you want a bigdisplayPrint
If you wish to buy a large screen phone with a good camera then you might consider the HTC Desire 816 G.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:16 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 7:00 pm
Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC first launched its Desire 816 phablet in June at a price of Rs 24,450 in India. After three months, in September, it introduced the cheaper version in the form of Desire 816 G at a price of Rs 18,990. The only major difference is that the former houses a 1.6 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor while the Desire 816 G has a 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek processor. There are not many phablets featuring a 5.5-inch screen in the sub Rs 20,000 range, so, is the Desire 816 G a good buy? We check out.
Quick specs: 5.5-inch 1280 x 720 HD display | 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek processor | Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS | 1 GB RAM | 8 GB internal memory expandable up to 32 GB | 13MP rear camera with auto-focus | 5 MP front camera | Dual Nano SIM (GSM + GSM) | 2600 mAh battery
Price: Rs 18,990
Design: It looks exactly similar to older Desire 816. The front of the phone houses two speakers vents and the 5 MP front camera. There are no capacitive buttons. The back is made out of glossy plastic and cannot be removed. The top right of the phone includes two nano SIM card slots along with a microSD card slot, covered by a plastic flap. The power/wake and volume buttons are on the left, which is frustrating sometimes specially while clicking pictures.
Despite the large 5.5-inch screen, the phone doesn’t compromise on one-handed operability or grip.The review unit was all-white, so, I easily managed to make it look dirty. The phone appears sleek and stylish but the glossy plastic back, makes it slippery.
The phone feels solid but the build quality is not strong. It’s a delicate smartphone which needs to be handled with care.
Display: The 1280 x 720 HD display is decent. HTC is not offering something unique in the display of this phablet. However, there is no Corning Gorilla glass or similar protection, which is very surprising! The display is good for watching movies, playing games and average users shouldn’t have any complains. The viewing angles are good and offer decent outdoor visibility as well.
Performance: In the age of octa-core processors, HTC is not offering anything tempting at least on paper. However, the quad-core MediaTek processor performs well. I did not witness any lags and again average users shouldn’t have any complains related to the performance. Overall, the experience is smooth.
Camera: The smartphone comes with a good camera. The images captured in low light also come with fair amount of detailing. Daylight images are even better with accurate colours. The 5 MP front camera also captures good quality selfies provided if you can hold a 5.5-inch phone with one hand. Overall, users will love the camera of this smartphone.
Connectivity: There are no issues with connectivity.
Battery: The 2600 mAh battery does a decent job. It can easily last an entire day for an average user.
Storage: The device offers 8GB of internal storage out of which around 4 GB is available. The memory can be further expanded up to 32 GB. So, investing in more storage is recommended.
Verdict: HTC has done a decent job by placing a 5.5-inch phone in Rs 18,000 segment. If you want to buy a large screen phone with a good camera then you can consider the HTC Desire 816 G. The Asus Zenfone 6 is another option at a price of Rs 16,999.
But if you are happy with a 5-inch display, then buying this phone makes little sense as you might find it difficult to fit (any) 5.5-inch screen phone inside your jeans pocket, especially while riding a bike. Also, there are several other 5-inch smartphones at a lower price.

On November 8, 83 women, all residents of nearby villages, had undergone surgeries at the sterilisation camp held at Nemichand Jain Cancer and Research Centre in Pendari village of Takhatpur region.
Under attack from opposition Congress which demanded his resignation, Chief Minister Raman Singh announced a high-level probe into the matter and suspended four officials, including the Chief Medical and Health Officer of Bilaspur, and transferred Director of Health Services Dr Kamalpreet Singh.

Bombs hit Libyan city housing electedparliamentFile Photo (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Cairo | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:07 pm
A Libyan army spokesman says two car bombs have gone off in the eastern city of Tobruk, where the nation’s elected parliament is temporarily located, causing casualties.
Mohammed Hegazi says the bombs exploded in front of an oil institute early Wednesday but that it was not immediately clear how many people were killed.
He says the attack meant to “terrorise” state institutions and the parliament, as well as deliver a “we are here” message from militants.
Hegazi says the blasts have the hallmarks of extremists from the eastern city of Darna who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.
Libya’s elected parliament was forced to relocate to the far-eastern city of Tobruk after Islamist-allied militias took over the country’s capital, Tripoli, and the second-largest city of Benghazi.

Government provides operational flexibility ...Government provides operational flexibility to oil firms

Cairn India
(Operational flexibility…)
NEW DELHI: In a bid to make it easier to produce oil and gas, the government has notified a set of rules granting operational flexibility to firms like Cairn India and ONGC to start producing from several discoveries that are mired in contractual disputes.
The Petroleum Ministry in a notification relaxed rigid timelines prescribed in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for development and production of oil and gas.
"The Government of India hereby notifies Policy Framework for Relaxations, Extension and Clarifications at the Development and Production Stage under the PSC regime for early monetisation of hydrocarbon discoveries," the order said.
Operational flexibility has been provided in enforcing contracts by way of relaxing some of timelines prescribed for discoveries so that E&P activities do not suffer on account of excessive rigidity in decision making.
The PSC between the government and the explorer has rigid timelines for each stage of exploration and actions have been initiated against firms even if deadlines are missed by a day.
The notification said 3-6 months extension in the current 18-60 month timeframe for submission of declaration of commerciality (DoC) of discoveries, a prerequisite before investment plans can be finalised, can be given.
Also, the deadline for submission of investment plan for the discoveries too would be extended by up to six months.
The PSC provides for time period for submission of field development plan (FDP) for hydrocarbon discovery after DOC. There is no provision in the PSC for extension of this time period and non-acceptance of FDP due to late submission results in non-monetisation of discoveries.
Also, upstream regulator DGH has been given flexibility to accept discoveries for which operators had failed to provide prior notification to the government.
The notification also provided for reduction in committed work programme in case a block or its part is not available for exploration activities consequent to denial of permission by government agencies.
Reduction of minimum work programme (MWP) will be considered in case of "blocks overlapping with Special Economic Zone (SEZ), reserve forest, naval exercise areas, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) danger zones, National Parks, urban areas and firing ranges of police/armed forces," it said.
Currently, discoveries, mostly of Cairn, ONGC and GSPC are stuck because of lack of flexibility in timelines. These include 10 finds of Cairn in Rajasthan which have not been endorsed by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).
Besides FDP approvals for more than two dozen finds are held up for some or the other reason. Fifteen discoveries lie abandoned in areas that have been relinquished by operators.

US-China climate deal aims to prod others to act...and
versions
BEIJING (AP) — A groundbreaking agreement struck Wednesday by the United States and China puts the world's two worst polluters on a faster track to curbing the heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. With the clock ticking on a worldwide climate treaty, the two countries sought to move beyond their troubled history as environmental adversaries and spur other nations.
The U.S., a chief proponent of the prospective treaty, is setting an ambitious new goal to stop pumping as much carbon dioxide into the air through the burning of coal, oil and gas. China, whose appetite for cheap energy has grown along with its burgeoning economy, agreed for the first time to a self-imposed deadline of 2030 for when its emissions will top out.
Yet it wasn't clear how either the U.S. or China would meet their goals, or whether China's growing emissions until 2030 would negate any reductions in the U.S.
Still, the dual announcements from President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, unveiled Wednesday in Beijing, came as a shock to environmentalists who had pined for such action but suspected China's reluctance and Obama's weakened political standing might interfere. In Washington, Republicans were equally taken aback, accusing Obama of saddling future presidents with an unrealistic burden.
In fact, the deal had been hashed out behind the scenes for months. During two days of talks last year at the Sunnylands estate in California, Obama and Xi reached an agreement on pursuing the reduction of hydrofluorocarbons that are used in refrigerators and insulating foams. A few months later, the U.S. and China would finalize the deal to seek the elimination of the potent gases.
To the White House, China's willingness to reach an accord on HFCs suggested a broader openness in tackling climate change, senior Obama administration officials said Wednesday. They spoke to reporters traveling with Obama to Myanmar from China, where Obama and Xi announced the landmark plan to reduce their carbon emissions.
Obama broached the idea of pursuing the joint plan in letter to Xi nine months ago, officials said, sparking secret discussions between U.S. and Chinese officials. Obama pressed the issue again during a meeting with China's vice premier on the sidelines of a U.N. climate summit in September, and the two countries finally sealed the deal in time to announce it in grand fashion at the Great Hall of the People as Obama's trip to China was coming to an end.
"This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship," Obama said, with Xi at his side. "It shows what's possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge."
But Obama's opponents in Congress balked, dismissing the new U.S. target as "job-destroying red tape" that would squeeze the middle class. "The president appears to be undeterred by the American people's clear repudiation of his policies of more regulations and higher energy costs," said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California.
Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leader of the Republicans who will take control of the Senate in January, said the deal "requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon emissions regulations are wreaking havoc in my state and other states."
Under the agreement, Obama set a goal to cut U.S. emissions between 26 and 28 percent by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. Officials have said the U.S. is already on track to meet Obama's earlier goal to lower emissions 17 percent by 2020, and that the revised goal meant the U.S. would be cutting pollution roughly twice as fast during a five-year period starting in 2020.
China, whose emissions are growing as it builds new coal plants, set a target for its emissions to peak by about 2030 — earlier if possible — with the idea being that its emissions would then start falling. Although that goal still allows China to keep pumping more carbon dioxide for the next 16 years, it marked an unprecedented step for Beijing, which has been reluctant to be boxed in on climate by the global community.
"This is, in my view, the most important bilateral climate announcement ever," said David Sandalow, a former top environmental official at the White House and the Energy Department.
World leaders who have been pressing for a global climate treaty heralded the deal, with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging all other nations to follow Obama's and Xi's lead by announcing their own emissions targets by early next year. Former Vice President Al Gore, a prominent environmentalist, called the Chinese move "a signal of groundbreaking progress from the world's largest polluter."
Scientists have pointed to the budding climate treaty, intended to be finalized next year in Paris, as a final opportunity to get emissions in check before the worst effects of climate change become unavoidable. Each nation is supposed to pledge to cut emissions by a specific amount, although negotiators are still haggling over whether those contributions should be binding.
Last month, the European Union said it would cut its emissions 40 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Taken together, the U.S, China and the EU account for more than half of global emissions, and there were already indications that the world's next-biggest emitter — India — might be feeling the pressure. "The international community will now expect India to make some firm commitments," said Jairam Ramesh, the former head of India's Environment Ministry.
Developing nations like India and China have long balked at being on the hook for climate change as much as wealthy nations like the U.S. that have been polluting for much longer. But China analysts said Beijing's willingness to cap its future emissions and to put Xi front and center signaled a significant turnaround.
For Obama, the fight against climate change has become a central facet of the legacy he hopes to leave. Facing opposition in Congress, Obama has sought to bypass lawmakers through emissions regulations on power plants and vehicles. His aides say his audacity on those fronts has boosted his credibility on climate change overseas.
In China, the smog-laden skies over its cities have become a source of embarrassment that the government has sought to obscure. Ahead of the economic summit that brought Obama and other leaders to Beijing, authorities shut down factories, banned wood fires and kept half the cars off the road.

APNewsBreak: GOP promises Cassidy a committee seat...and
versions
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Republicans have promised Bill Cassidy a seat on the Senate's energy committee if he defeats Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana's runoff election next month, potentially undercutting one of her main arguments for re-election.
Landrieu has repeatedly touted the importance of her seat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in her campaign for a fourth term representing a state with a robust oil and gas industry.
While she will no longer serve as the committee's chair in the GOP-led Senate in the next Congress, Landrieu has campaigned hard on her place as the committee's senior Democrat — and Cassidy's inability to get a seat on the panel as a freshman senator.
"The question is, do you want somebody on the committee or do you want a rookie that has no seniority and is likely to not even get on the committee," Landrieu said as she kicked off her runoff campaign.
But incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement released to The Associated Press that he will appoint Cassidy to the committee should Cassidy win his Dec. 6 runoff election against Landrieu.
"I'm confident Dr. Cassidy will use this position to succeed where Sen. Landrieu failed," McConnell said in a statement touting Cassidy's support for the Keystone XL pipeline and opposition to Obama administration efforts to place new restrictions on carbon emissions.
"Louisiana will have a senator that will use his clout to support energy jobs, not President (Barack) Obama," McConnell said.
Landrieu and Cassidy were forced into the December runoff when neither received more than 50 percent of the vote in the state's multi-candidate election.
As Louisiana's last Democratic statewide elected official, Landrieu has a difficult path to victory in a state that overwhelmingly backed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Fifty-eight percent of voters supported someone other than Landrieu in the primary.
Republican leaders are uniting behind Cassidy, a three-term congressman, while the national Democratic Party has decided against providing advertising support for Landrieu in the runoff.
Landrieu's position on the energy committee is a significant piece of her campaign narrative, along with her strong alliance with the oil and gas industry and her push for an expansion of drilling in the U.S.
Her campaign didn't comment on the McConnell announcement.
If elected, Cassidy's position on the committee would have limits. As a new senator, he would be low in the pecking order of panel members, and in the final two years of Obama's presidency, Cassidy and Louisiana's all-GOP congressional delegation would likely have little sway with the Democratic administration.
But Republicans have criticized Landrieu's chairmanship as ineffective for her energy-producing home state because she supports positions at odds with the Obama administration and the Senate's Democratic leadership.
Landrieu's support of the Keystone XL oil pipeline hasn't led to a Senate vote on advancing the long-delayed project. And her criticism of Obama's regulatory plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions hasn't altered the proposal, which calls for Louisiana to reduce its emissions from power plants by nearly 40 percent by 2030.
"Sen. Landrieu made much of her seat on the energy committee, but failed to use that seat to stand up to President Obama's assault on our energy economy," Cassidy said in a statement.
He said if elected he would use his committee position "to stand up to President Obama, to deliver a floor vote on the Keystone XL pipeline and to protect Louisiana's energy industry."

Ananthapur, Nov.12:  
MEIL Green Power Limited has commissioned a 50 MW Concentrated Solar Thermal Power Project farm at Pamidi in Ananthapur District of Andhra Pradesh.
MGPL, a unit of Megha Engineering & Infrastructures Ltd., Hyderabad, has invested Rs 848 crore on the project set up on a 600-acre site located about 350 km from Hyderabad.
Uma Maheshwar Raddy, Associate Vice-President of MEIL, said the company expects to generate revenues of about Rs 110 crore per annum from the solar plant.
"Having taken up the EPC works for this project, we have taken several other solar EPC contracts in the country," he said.
This is the largest Solar Thermal Power Project in southern India, the company official said.
This power is expected to reduce about 80 thousand tonnes of carbon emissions every year.
The solar power project mandate was awarded to the company under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission for a capacity of 50 MW out of the total of 470 MW by NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam planned under the JNNSM scheme.
The CSP plant utilises parabolic trough collectors and uses energy from the Sun to generate heat, which gets transferred to turbines for power generation.
The plant is expected to generate 110 million units of solar power and supplies it at Rs 11 per unit. As per the arrangement, the power would be supplied to NTPC arm, which in turn supplies 440 million units of thermal power from Central unallocated power along with solar power to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

Mobile app used by tribal farmers wins prize in global challengeMobile app used by tribal farmers wins prize in global challenge
K V Kurmanath
Tweet
Hyderabad, Nov. 12:  
About 12,000 tribals growing coffee and pepper in 658 villages in the Araku Valley use a software on pay-per-use or under the Software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. They pay Rs 2 a month to use the mobile-based application that keeps them in touch with the market, their cooperative body and the remaining stakeholders associated with their livelihood.
The application, Livelihood 360, received a cash prize of Rs 9.79 lakh in a global app challenge organised by Telenor at Oslo recently. Adjudged the Best App in Asia among five other contenders in the continent, the app was showcased at the Digital Winners’ conference.
“We developed the app about 18 months ago and are offering it to the tribal farmers through the Nandi Foundation. Keeping in view the prevalence of low-end phones, we have devised the app in such a way that they can use it offline as well. The moment they get network, their information is synchronised with data in the cloud,” Raghu Kanchustambham, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Concept Waves, told BusinessLine here on Wednesday.
Scaling up
He said the company would like to scale up the usage by entering into agreements with partners. “The app is crop agnostic and can work for any crop. We see a huge opportunity to make it available to farmers growing other crops,” he said.
The firm also sells educational technologies that helps academic institutions reach out to scores of students across locations.
“We will seek about Rs 5 crore from angel-funding agencies to scale up our activities,” Raghu said.

Aurobindo Pharma set to acquire US nutritional supplements maker Natrol for $133 mnEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Aurobindo Pharma is all set to acquire troubled US-based nutritional supplement maker, Natrol Inc for USD 132.5 million (over Rs 810 crore) after emerging as the highest bidder for acquisition.
Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc, a subsidiary of the Hyderabad-based firm, has emerged as the highest bidder for acquisition of Natrol Inc and other affiliate entities, under a process to be finally approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
“Under the auction process, Aurobindo USA emerged as the highest and best bidder with a bid of USD 132.5 million to acquire the assets of Natrol with an agreement to take on certain liabilities,” Aurobindo Pharma said in a statement.
The buyout of Natrol would provide the right platform for creating a fully-integrated OTC platform in the US and other international markets, it added.
Natrol, which manufactures and sells nutritional supplements in US and other international markets, provides Aurobindo with strong brand reputation and presence in a variety of attractive supplement markets, it said.
“This acquisition is subject to final approval by the US court and other statutory approvals as may be required, including any termination of the waiting period or approval under the HSR Act, and closing conditions as per the Asset Purchase Agreement,” Aurobindo Pharma said.
Barclays acted as the sole financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as the legal counsel to Aurobindo USA, it added.
Aurobindo Pharma shares were trading at Rs 1,066 apiece on the BSE, up 3.69 per cent from its previous close.

Violence against men
Special Arrangement Delving into the subconscious: Martin Moran
TOPICS
theatre
In the Yael Farber-directed Nirbhaya, which centred on the December 2012 rape case, producer Poorna Jagannathan, with four other actors broke the silence on sexual violence against women.
The powerful production gave many women the courage to speak of their experience with sexual violence and abuse. But the one feedback that stayed with Poorna was why stories of sexual violence against boys and men were not included. “We have to start from rock bottom when it comes to male sexual violence, because there is no acknowledgment of it. Before we break the silence around it, we first need to accept that it exists.”
Using theatre as a tool to tell powerful stories, yet again, Poorna has brought Martin Moran, American actor and writer, to perform solo shows of his award-winning plays The Tricky Part and All The Rage, to India. “One in two boys is abused in India. I hope the plays will make us acknowledge that there is such an epidemic.”
Directed by Seth Barrish, the pieces are testimonials drawn from Moran’s experience of sexual abuse from age 12 by his counsellor. But they are stories told with grace.
“He uses humour to lighten a very dark place in his life,” says Poorna, an American actor.
The Tricky Part is a contemplative piece, in which Martin tries to come terms with what happened to him as a boy. All The Rage emerged out of a reaction to The Tricky Part, in which Martin tries to understand why he didn’t feel anger towards his molester.
Martin explores “anger and compassion and where it meets in human life.” Poorna adds that both plays delve within the self, and that given the complex nature of sexual abuse, the plays aren’t black-and-white, but have shades of grey.
Poorna says she hopes that by addressing sexual violence against boys and men, we can make headway in solving sexual violence against women. “In our society we think men can’t be vulnerable. That it is not masculine to be vulnerable. This has to change.”
Poorna adds that there are NGOs like Enfold in Bangalore, Arpan in Mumbai and Rahi in Delhi that address child sexual abuse, including male sexual abuse.
The Tricky Part and All The Rage, each 80 minutes long, will be staged at Ranga Shankara from today till November 13.

iPhones and iPads vulnerable to attacks by hackers: ExpertsiOS bug enables hackers to access devices by persuading users to install malicious applications.
By: Reuters | Posted: November 11, 2014 9:36 pm
Researchers have warned that a bug in Apple Inc’s iOS operating system makes most iPhones (including the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus) and iPads vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers seeking access to sensitive data and control of their devices.
Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc published details about the vulnerability on its blog on Monday, saying the bug enables hackers to access devices by persuading users to install malicious applications with tainted text messages, emails and Web links.
The malicious application can then be used to replace genuine, trusted apps that were installed through Apple’s App Store, including email and banking programs, with malicious software through a technique that FireEye has dubbed “Masque Attack.”
These attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data, according to FireEye, which is well-regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research.
“It is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to exploit,” FireEye Senior Staff Research Scientist Tao Wei said in an interview.
Apple’s iOS has robust security features that make it extremely difficult for attackers to install malware on devices using traditional techniques for infecting Windows machines and Android mobile devices with malicious emails and Web links. The “Masque Attack” makes that possible by exploiting a system that Apple developed to allow large organizations to deploy custom-built software without going through Apple’s App Store, according to David Richardson, iOS product manager at mobile security firm Lookout.
Those applications are not vetted by Apple for malicious software, unlike apps in its App Store, though users do receive pop-up notifications asking if they want to prevent the apps from installing on devices, he said.
“You can just say ‘Don’t install.’ As long as you do that, you will be protected from this vulnerability,” Richardson said.
FireEye disclosed the vulnerability to Apple in July and representatives of the company said they were working to fix the bug, according to Wei.
Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.
News of the vulnerability began to leak out in October on specialized Web forums where security experts and hackers alike discuss information on Apple bugs, Wei said.
He said FireEye decided to go public with its findings after Palo Alto Networks Inc last week uncovered WireLurker, the first campaign to exploit the vulnerability.
“Currently WireLurker is the only one, but we will see more,” Wei said.

Five unconventional -- and occasionally awkward -- Veterans Day tributesBy Dan Lamothe November 11 Follow @danlamothe
Veterans Day has brought a wealth of classy tributes on Twitter this year, many of which can be viewed with the hashtags #shareyourstory and #veteransday. But corporate America also is involved, offering a variety of sales that rubs at least one CEO — Howard Schultz of Starbucks — the wrong way.
Social media is filled with tributes to veterans that range from the unconventional to the straight-up tacky. Here, a sampling:

Hooters, like many restaurants, is offering veterans free food on Veterans Day. But they’re doing so with a hashtag they have used periodically since 2012, playing off an iconic line in “God Bless America.”
The company is fond of saying that it is “delightfully tacky, yet unrefined.” This hashtag pushes those limits of being delightful, to say the least.

Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP govt in Maharashtra wins trust voteLetters to  the editor
The 13-day-old BJP government headed by Devendra Fadnavis today won the confidence motion in Maharashtra Assembly by a voice vote, amid protests by former ally Shiv Sena.
As the motion seeking vote of confidence in the BJP government moved by MLA Ashish Shelar was passed in the House where the ruling party is in minority, Shiv Sena MLAs stormed the Well seeking division of votes.
“The motion has been passed,” Speaker Haribhau Bagade announced in the din.
Agitated members of Shiv Sena, which had earlier said that it will oppose the trust vote and and had demanded that its leader Eknath Shinde be accorded the status of Leader of Opposition, shouted slogans.
The Speaker later also announced appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.
Earlier in the day, Bagde was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly after Congress and Shiv Sena withdrew their candidates from the race.
The Speaker had said he would take up the issue of Sena’s demand for LoP’s post after the trust vote as Congress had also staked claim and he would have to study the legal implications. Congress had demanded LoP’s post on the ground that Sena continued to be a constituent of BJP-led NDA.
After Sena members objected to the passing of the trust motion by a voice vote and sought division, Bagde adjourned the House.
When proceedings resumed, the Speaker announced appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.

Uddhav Thackeray clueless about what to do: RaneLetters to  the editor
Congress MLA Nitesh Rane yesterday said that Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray was completely clueless as to the future course for his party.
“Uddhav Thackeray has no idea which side he is on and why is he on that side. He does not know where he has to take his party in future. He is completely at sea,” he told reporters.
As it is still uncertain whether Sena would become a part of the BJP-led government in Maharashtra in future, Nitesh said Sena had reduced itself to a position where it had no choice.
“Shiv Sena is today in a position where it will take whatever is offered. It does not really matter if they are given Leader of Opposition status or a share in the new government,” he said.
“If the president of a party himself does not know about the status of his party, what will the party do in future and how will it be able to fight for the people of Maharashtra? If he does not revive his party soon, he will become a joke,” said Nitesh, a first-time MLA from Kankavli.
Nitesh’s father, Narayan Rane, a former Shiv Sena leader who is now a bitter critic of Uddhav Thackeray, is now a senior Congress leader.

Detach from attachments   chant Tibetan monks perturbed by cyberattacks'Detach from attachments', chant Tibetan monks perturbed by cyberattacks
AP  Dharamsala, November 12, 2014
First Published: 12:25 IST(12/11/2014) | Last Updated: 14:45 IST(12/11/2014)
Buffeted by persistent cyberattacks, Tibetan monks are giving new meaning to their ancient creed: Detach from attachments.
 
"Attachment can lead you to all sort of trouble and we Buddhists believe that non-attachment alone can lead you to happiness," 30-year-old monk Jamyang Palden told The Associated Press at a cafe in the Indian hill town of Dharamsala, before giving the philosophy its Information Age twist: "We have to learn to be suspicious of email attachments."
 
The Internet safety slogan, one of several messages championed by digital security group Tibet Action Institute, is an example of how human rights defenders are seeking creative ways to protect activists from electronic espionage.
 
"It's cheesy, but it's memorable," said Freya Putt, a Vancouver-based activist.

There's little doubt that groups like Tibet Action need protection. A major study published Tuesday by Internet watchdog Citizen Lab shows that it and other civil society organizations have been penetrated by cyberspies, many of them linked to China. And the report says that those behind the compromises are the same hackers responsible for high-profile attacks on major multinationals and Western governments.
 
"They're using the same weaponry, the same arsenal — indiscriminately," said Citizen Lab director Ronald Deibert.
 
Deibert's study draws on four years of research with Tibet Action and nine other cooperating civil society groups. Eight are China or Tibet-focused; two are large international human rights organizations.
 
Altogether the groups forwarded more than 800 suspicious emails to Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs. Experts there scanned the emails for malicious software, checked several organizations' networks for intruders, interviewed campaigners and, in the case of one particularly hard-hit human rights organization, combed through half a dozen hard drives.
 
All 10 groups were compromised at some point during the study, many of them through emails carrying booby-trapped attachments.
 
In a 2012 attack email shared with the AP, Tibet Action's director Lhadon Tethong was approached by a hacker impersonating a well-known China scholar, asking whether she would proof-read a list of Tibetans who have set themselves on fire in protest against the government in Beijing.
 
"Would you please have a look and make necessary corrections?" the email asks.
 
That attack failed — Tethong sensed a trap when she noticed the email did not come from the scholar's professional address — but others succeeded. Deibert said one rights group had its network compromised by "APT1" — a prolific hacking crew whose activities have been tied to China's People's Liberation Army — for 20 months.
 
The Chinese Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the report. Beijing is often accused of masterminding electronic attacks against an array of targets, including human rights groups. It's a charge it regularly denies.
 
Most targets of the attacks studied by Citizen Lab are anonymous, something Deibert says is in part because security holes identified by his colleagues remain unpatched. That means the organizations could be at greater risk if their names got out.
 
Others may simply fear losing face.
 
"There's still a stigma in some circles around computer breaches of any sort," Deibert said.
 
That isn't an issue for Tibet Action, whose work is centered on raising awareness about online threats.
 
The efforts involve comic strips which portray Tibetans being spied through their webcams or their smartphones by glowering Chinese officers with 1950s-style headsets, and a video skit in which "Attachment" — played by a grinning Tibetan amateur — sneaks into a man's home and steals his wallet.
 
It may be corny but trainer Lobsang Gyatso Sither says the humor works. Sither shows the film and repeats the 'Detach from Attachments' mantra at digital security classes he teaches in Dharamsala and elsewhere.
 
Palden, the monk, appears to have gotten the point. He tapes over his Mac's webcam, takes the battery out of his Nokia handset when he doesn't want to be tracked and avoids popular Chinese chat program QQ. And he has absorbed the main message: "I do not open attachments from sources I do not trust," he said.

Deibert says the plight of people like Palden is often lost amid a cybersecurity debate which focuses on attacks against Fortune 500 companies and high-powered defense contractors.
 
"Ironically we are spotlighting the organizations that are the most equipped, that have the most resources and capacity to throw at the problem while leaving aside the organizations that could use the most help," Deibert said.
 
He said one solution might be for human rights organizations — and their funders — to follow Tibetan Action's example in opening up about the threats they face.
 
"I'm not a Buddhist," Deibert said, "but groups around the world could learn a lot from the Tibetans."

Mumbai: Hours before the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Maharashtra faces a trust vote on Wednesday, the Shiv Sena said it would sit in the opposition.
Senior Sena leader Ramdas Kadam said, “As no honourable proposal of power sharing came from the BJP, finally party president Uddhav Thackeray told us Sena will sit in opposition and vote against confidence motion of Devendra Fadnavis government.”
Kadam added: “We were negotiating with the BJP for last one month, but the BJP kept on insisting that you declare unconditional support first and we will discuss power-sharing formula later, which was not acceptable to us. So last night, we told them in no uncertain terms, we don’t believe you and we won’t get dragged behind you.”
However, the BJP managed to persuade both Sena and Congress to withdraw their candidates for the speaker’s post and BJP’s nominee Haribhau Bagde was elected unanimously.
On Tuesday evening, Fadnavis called Thackeray and met Congress party’s leader in the Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil and appealed to them to continue with the tradition of electing the Assembly speaker unanimously.

Aurobindo set to acquire nutritional supplements maker NatrolEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Aurobindo Pharma is all set to acquire troubled US-based nutritional supplement maker, Natrol Inc for USD 132.5 million (over Rs 810 crore) after emerging as the highest bidder for acquisition.
Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc, a subsidiary of the Hyderabad-based firm, has emerged as the highest bidder for acquisition of Natrol Inc and other affiliate entities, under a process to be finally approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
“Under the auction process, Aurobindo USA emerged as the highest and best bidder with a bid of USD 132.5 million to acquire the assets of Natrol with an agreement to take on certain liabilities,” Aurobindo Pharma said in a statement.
The buyout of Natrol would provide the right platform for creating a fully-integrated OTC platform in the US and other international markets, it added.
Natrol, which manufactures and sells nutritional supplements in US and other international markets, provides Aurobindo with strong brand reputation and presence in a variety of attractive supplement markets, it said.
“This acquisition is subject to final approval by the US court and other statutory approvals as may be required, including any termination of the waiting period or approval under the HSR Act, and closing conditions as per the Asset Purchase Agreement,” Aurobindo Pharma said.
Barclays acted as the sole financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as the legal counsel to Aurobindo USA, it added.
Aurobindo Pharma shares were trading at Rs 1,066 apiece on the BSE, up 3.69 per cent from its previous close.

Sensex ends above 28 000  Nifty at new peakMarket update: Sensex ends above 28,000, Nifty touches 8,400-level

The BSE Sensex on Wednesday closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions. It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points.
It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in Tuesday's trade. A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours on Wednesday, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 per cent), Bajaj Auto (2.10 per cent), HDFC Ltd (1.12 per cent), SBI (0.17 per cent), ICICI Bank (1.33 per cent), HDFC Bank (0.44 per cent), ITC (1.55 per cent), Bharti Airtel (0.64 per cent), BHEL (0.88 per cent), Coal India (0.10 per cent), Dr Reddy's (0.58 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 per cent), Tata Motors (1.71 per cent) and TCS (0.55 per cent).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.

Maharashtra: Sena  Congress want fresh floor test  speaker says he went by rulesThe BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra won a crucial confidence motion on Wednesday through a voice vote that the Shiv Sena described as “strangling democracy” and the Congress called “a black day”.
 
The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member assembly, passed the test to prove its majority through a simple “Aye” from legislators supporting the 13-day-old minority government, though their voice got muffled in the din raised by the Shiv Sena and the Congress.
 
Speaker Haribhau Bagde suspended five Congress legislators for two years after they allegedly heckled governor C Vidyasagar Rao who was injured in the melee as protests inside and outside the assembly turned ugly.
 
The BJP government needed to prove its majority because it was 22 short of the halfway mark in the assembly. Having snapped its 25-year alliance with the Shiv Sena, it didn’t have the 63 MLAs of its former ally to bail it out.
 
Bagde, who was elected unopposed earlier in the day, called the voice vote valid and rejected the opposition’s demand for a poll.
 
“The house should be run as per rules and the Constitution should not be trampled upon. The new government is strangling democracy. We sought division but the trust motion was passed by voice vote,” said opposition leader Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena.
 
The Congress questioned the legitimacy of the trust vote and said it would approach the governor with the request to ask the Fadnavis government to prove its majority by a poll.
 
“This is the darkest day in the history of the Maharashtra assembly. We will not allow the house to function under this minority government,” said former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan.
 
Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam said the BJP government’s act was against the spirit of the Constitution and threatened to take legal recourse. “Vidhan Sabha stands tarnished today. A division would have made it clear whether they have the support of the majority of MLAs. The confidence motion has not been passed.”
 
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Bagde rubbished the opposition’s claims, saying due process was followed.
 
"Congress and Shiv Sena did not ask for a poll (division of votes) at the appropriate time. Since Congress has always been in power it has forgotten the rules about when to ask for division of votes,” Fadnavis told reporters
 
All this while MLAs of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which had committed its support to the Fadnavis government, sat quietly and watched the opposition demand a division. The division of votes, which according to convention is held with legislators voting for or against a motion, was ruled out by the Speaker.
 
The BJP had said it had direct and indirect support of 140 MLAs but needed some legislators to vote for it or abstain in the event of a poll.
 
Since there was no clarity on which way the NCP voted, the speaker’s move was seen as an attempt to save the BJP the embarrassment of publicly going along with Sharad Pawar’s party that has 41 MLAs, sources said.
 
Despite the day’s developments, the BJP indicated in the evening that it was still open to an alliance with the Sena. Fadnavis told HT that he has plans to expand his cabinet before the winter session of the legislature begins in Nagpur on December 8.

Sajjad Lone on meeting PM: What s the big dealWhy create such a noise about my meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asks former Kashmiri separatist leader Sajjad Gani Lone, who wonders what the hullabaloo is all about.

Sajjad Lone, 47, hogged news headlines by meeting Modi. He became the first former Kashmiri separatist leader to do so after Modi came to power in May.
Chairman of People's Conference, Sajjad Lone is the firebrand London educated, eloquent son of late Abdul Gani Lone who was killed in a separatist rally in Srinagar May 21, 2002.
Sajjad spoke at length to IANS in an interview in Srinagar. He  discussed his future plans and the possibilities ahead in Kashmir politics that his meeting with the prime minister could throw up.
"To be very frank with you, my meeting the prime minister is not something new. When I joined politics after the death of father, I have known BJP leaders and have met them a number of times at a social level during the previous years," he said.
"Well, why create such a noise about my meeting Mr. Modi? Haven't others been meeting him? He is the prime minister of the country and one got to respect that position," he told IANS.
Sajjad joined mainstream politics in 2009 when he contested the Lok Sabha elections from north Kashmir's Baramulla constitguency. He  lost to the regional National Conference candidate, Sharief-ud-Din Shariq.
Married to Asma Khan, the daughter of Pakistan-based chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation front (JKLF) Amanullah Khan, Sajad has stirred the hornet's nest after he met Modi and said the prime minister behaved like "an elder brother with me".
Sajjad dismissed reports that his meeting with Modi would throw political equations upside down in Kashmir.
"I have no delusions about anything. Ours is a small political party and I am not a game changer of any kind," he said.
Asked whether or not it is uncomfortable for him to have met Modi, Sajjad said: "I am not a prisoner of perceptions...Government of India has a national policy towards Kashmir and the present BJP government at the Centre is going to be no different to that policy. This is my belief. Therefore, there is nothing uncomfortable or comfortable about meeting the prime minister."
Spelling out his future plans, Sajad said: "My first objective is to get into the state assembly by fighting the elections. Our party is fighting the assembly elections after such a long time."
He quickly added: "But, let me be very clear about it, we are fighting these elections on our own and without any alliance with other parties. We are fielding candidates for 20 to 30 seats and are fighting all the seats from the Kupwara district."
Asked whether he favours an alliance with the BJP after the election results, he said, "They are a very big party. I have not even discussed this issue with them."
"Well, the numbers would finally determine who forms alliances with whom after the results."
Trying not to hype his meeting with Modi when asked whether the BJP had reached out to him or he had made efforts to reach out to that party on his own, Sajjad said: "Don't kindly try to read too much into this. I am a small person, but at a personal level I believe Modi has ideas about Kashmir's development, in infrastructure, tourism, healthcare, education".
Asked whether his future plans include becoming the chief minister of the state, Sajjad laughed and said: "I have patience and I am not a fool. Those who say I am in a hurry to become the chief minister or that I plan to do so by creating alliance or meeting people are underestimating me."
"Sajjad Lone has seen a long life in these 47 years. So, I am neither lured nor deterred by these statements."
Asked whether he sees any difference between the BJP and the Congress given their approaches to Kashmir politics, Sajad said: "Not all parties are same and the fact that the two are pitched against each other also means their approaches to problems would be different".

MUMBAI, Nov 12:  
India's natural rubber imports in October surged 27.7 per cent from a year ago to 36,865 tonnes, the state-run Rubber Board said, as a drop in the production prompted tyre makers to increase overseas purchases.

Sobha posts5.12% growth in Q2 profitsSobha posts 5.12% growth in Q2 profits
Our Bureau
In the last 20 years, Sobha has delivered 95 real estate and 253 contractual projects, totalling 65.83 million sq ft.
Bangalore, Nov. 12:  
Sobha Limited on unaudited consolidated basis has posted 5.12 per cent growth in its profits to Rs 59.5 crore for second quarter of 2014-15 compared with Rs 56.6 crore recorded in the same period last year.
The company’s total income has gone up 23.98 per cent to Rs 669.5 crore as against Rs 540 crore in the same period last year. EPS for Q2 stood at Rs 6.07 compared with Rs 5.77 last year.
Commenting on the company’s perforance, J.C. Sharma, Vice Chairman and Managing Director, Sobha Limited, said, “We have seen an improvement in the market sentiments post the formation of the new government. The economy is most certainly showing signs of recovery and there has been an uptick in the investor sentiments. The inflation is under control, the crude oil prices have declined and the interest rates, having peaked, will most likely taper down. Despite this, the real estate sector is yet to be benefited by the positive change in the economic conditions. Given the current scenario, we are of the opinion that recovery is not far away for the real estate sector.”
Talking about the company’s growth prospects, Sharma said, “We have a healthy pipeline of about 15 million square feet of new project launches planned in the next few quarters in our existing geographies. In the last 20 years, we have completed and delivered 95 real estate and 253 contractual projects totalling 65.83 million square feet of area. We are probably the only player in the real estate arena to deliver international quality projects to this size and scale. In addition to this, we have about 50 ongoing residential projects aggregating to 31.14 million square feet of developable area and 23.96 million square feet of saleable area. On the contractual front, we have 31 ongoing projects covering 9.35 million square feet under various stages of construction. This is a mere indication of our delivery capabilities and we are hopeful that we will continue to cater to the emerging needs of the realty industry.”

Sena slams BJP over NCP support  likens Pawars party to mousePrint
Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' said that NCP 'nibbled the state coffers like a mouse'.
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:48 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 5:50 pm
Though Maharashtra government led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has won the trust vote in the Assembly but before the House went for voting, the opposition Shiv Sena slammed the BJP government and warned its former ally that it will be disrespecting people’s mandate if it takes support of NCP which “nibbled the state coffers like a mouse”.
“(Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra) Fadnavis once said that he wants to run the government for the people. But how do you plan to run the government taking support of a party that has been discarded by the people of the state?
“Will you win the trust vote taking support of a party which has nibbled at the state coffers like a mouse? Will you take support of a mouse?”, the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
Taunting its former ally, the party said the BJP is ready to take Sena’s support to save face during the trust vote, but is unrelenting on carrying forward talks regarding Sena’s role in the state government.
“BJP asks us to give it support on the basis of similar ideologies and principles. You (BJP) also know that the ideology of NCP is only to loot Maharashtra,” it alleged.
“But you (BJP) have nothing to do with that? You are ready to take their unconditional support,” the Sena said while asking the BJP “on whose tunes it plans to dance now”.
It is a strange scenario where the party with largest mandate is joining hands with a party that fared badly during the recent Assembly elections, the Sena said.
“Why was the NCP thrown to the fourth position this time? What kind of principles does the BJP talk about when it agrees to take support of a party which was relegated to the fourth position by the people,” it said.
“Saving the government is the only priority of BJP, for which it will also take support of the MIM which is working towards vitiating the minds of people,” the Sena alleged.

Dubai woos commuters with first tram line... 
ADAM SCHRECK | November 12, 2014 07:19 AM EST | Associated Press
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The Mideast commercial hub of Dubai opened its first tram line on Wednesday, enticing would-be riders with air-conditioned platforms and a premium section on its sleek cars for those willing to spend a few more dirhams.
The 10.6 kilometer (6.6 mile) street-level line aims to provide alternatives to driving along Dubai's rapidly developing southwestern coast, an area popular with expatriate professionals and ever-growing numbers of foreign tourists.
The line includes 11 stations linking the skyscraper-jammed Dubai Marina with office parks, hotels and residential areas further up the coastal road. Officials plan to extend the line to eventually include 17 stations.
The tram line opened to the public Wednesday morning following a fireworks-studded inauguration the previous evening. Like many Dubai projects, it debuted several years behind schedule.
Visitor Sultan Saeed Subhi from Oman decided to try out the tram on opening day. He said he was glad to find an affordable alternative to the city's ubiquitous taxis.
"It is really going to ease things for people going from one place to another," he said.
Dubai authorities are eager to promote public transport in this car-loving city, particularly as population numbers swell as the city recovers from its 2009 financial crisis and it gears up to host the World Expo in 2020. They hope to attract 27,000 a day for now, and some 66,000 by the end of the decade.
Tram commuters can connect to the Dubai Metro, a driverless elevated rail line that opened in 2009, as well as an existing monorail line that glides down the middle of the city's first man-made palm-shaped island, Palm Jumeirah.
Tram platforms are enclosed and air conditioned, with doors that slide open once a tram pulls in. Like the metro, each tram contains a special women-only section and a "gold class" compartment for those willing to pay double the base fare of 3 dirhams (82 cents).
Mattar al-Tayer, who heads the emirate's Roads and Transport Authority, said the project reflects Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's desire to have a tramway "unprecedented worldwide in terms of safety and luxury in order to deliver classy services to residents and visitors."
The RTA did not say how much the first phase of the project cost, but it valued a 75-month operating contract granted to British firm Serco at 105 million dirhams ($28.6 million). A consortium including French engineering firm Alstom and Belgian construction company Besix built the line.

Jackson exiting  American Idol  after 13 years... 
November 12, 2014 07:08 AM EST | Associated Press
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fox and the producers of "American Idol" say Randy Jackson is leaving the show after 13 seasons.
In a statement Tuesday, the network and producers call Jackson a key part of the singing contest and say he'll be welcomed back as a visitor.
Phone and email requests to his publicist seeking comment were not immediately returned.
Jackson, Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul made up Idol's original judging panel. Jackson served as a judge for 12 seasons, with "dawg" becoming his trademark word while assessing contestants.
Jackson moved to the role of mentor this year. His departure leaves host Ryan Seacrest as the only original cast member.
"American Idol" is set to return in January with judges Jennifer Lopez, Harry Connick Jr. and Keith Urban.

Rothko  Jasper Johns star at NYC art auction...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — Extremely rare portraits by Andy Warhol of Hollywood superstars Elvis Presley and Marlon Brando were among the highlights at a record-breaking auction of postwar and contemporary art on Wednesday.
Warhol's "Triple Elvis (Ferus Type)" sold for $81.9 million and "Four Marlons" brought in $69.6 million at Christie's, which said the evening sale realized $852.9 million, the highest total for any auction.
Works by Willem de Kooning and Cy Twombly also broke auction records for the artists.
"Triple Elvis" and "Four Marlons" rate among Warhol's most famous portraits. The nearly 7-foot-high portraits were acquired by German casino company WestSpiel in the 1970s for one of its casinos.
The Elvis, executed in ink and silver paint in 1963, depicts the rock 'n' roll heartthrob as a cowboy, armed and shooting from the hip. The Brando silkscreen, created three years later, shows the actor on a motorcycle in a black leather jacket, an image that is repeated four times.
Warhol produced a series of 22 images of Elvis. His "Double Elvis (Ferus Type)" sold for $37 million at Sotheby's in 2012.
Last fall, his "Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)" set an auction record for his work when it sold at Sotheby's for $105.4 million.
There's only one other four-times Brando, in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen. A "Double Marlon" sold at Christie's for $32.5 million in 2008.
De Kooning's "Clamdigger," a life-size sculpture created in 1972, sold for $29.2 million, a world auction record for a sculpture by the artist. The bronze sculpture never left the artist, and it stood in the entry of his studio on eastern Long Island for about four decades.
The inspiration for it came from the clam diggers the abstract expressionist artist observed on the beach every day.
"Clamdiggers" was offered for sale by the daughters of Lisa de Kooning, who inherited the sculpture from her father when he died in 1997. She died in 2012.
The auction record for any work by de Kooning is $32.1 million for "Untitled VIII," set last year at Christie's.
Twombly's "Untitled," one of the famous series of "Blackboard" paintings he made between 1966 and 1971, brought in $69.6 million, a world auction record for his work. With their spiraling lines on a dark gray background, the paintings were so-named because they resembled the slate of classroom blackboard.
An oversized sculpture of a monkey by the popular artist Jeff Koons was another auction highlight.
Koons' whimsical stainless steel "Balloon Monkey (Orange)" fetched $25.9 million. Measuring nearly 12 feet high and 20 feet long, it looks like an inflated twisted balloon.
Koons became the most expensive living artist last year when his "Balloon Dog (Orange)" was auctioned for $58.4 million. A retrospective of his work recently closed at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Marilyn Monroe s lost love letters to be auctioned... 
JOHN ROGERS | November 12, 2014 07:07 AM EST | Associated Press
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — It's no secret Joe DiMaggio loved Marilyn Monroe. The baseball great cried at her funeral and for 20 years had flowers placed at her crypt several times a week.
The public displays were unusual for the famously stoic and private DiMaggio. Now, his heartbreak over the breakup of their marriage will get a rare public airing when "Marilyn Monroe's Lost Archives" goes up for bid at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills next month.
"I love you and want to be with you," DiMaggio said in one pained letter to Monroe from the collection, written when she announced she was filing for divorce after a matter of months in 1954. "There is nothing I would like better than to restore your confidence in me."
The 300 items also include love letters from Monroe's third and final husband, playwright Arthur Miller. There's also a handwritten letter from Monroe to Miller in which the woman who was arguably Hollywood's greatest sex symbol muses about her many insecurities.
DiMaggio wrote in his letter that he learned Monroe was leaving him when he saw her make the announcement on television.
"My heart split even wider seeing you cry in front of all these people," he wrote in the letter addressed to "Mrs. Joe DiMaggio" and mailed special delivery.
Other letters in the collection come from such friends as Clark Gable, Cary Grant and Jane Russell, the latter imploring Monroe in 10 neatly handwritten pages to give her marriage to DiMaggio another chance.
"It really gives you the chills when you read some of the stuff and see the intimacy and the personal nature of it," said auction curator Martin Nolan, who spent nine months organizing and cataloging the collection.
Auction owner Darren Julien estimates the pieces could fetch $1 million or more, noting a watercolor Monroe painted and planned to give to President John Kennedy went for $80,000 at an estate auction nine years ago.  Monroe's "collectability" has skyrocketed in recent years, driven in part by deep-pocketed Asian and European collectors with a fondness for American pop-culture artifacts, he said.
The fact that the centerpiece of this collection is not just celebrity tchotchkes but deeply personal artifacts is also expected to fuel interest.
"We anticipate a lot of fans will be here. They'll fly in from all over the world," said Julien, who will put the items on display to the public at his Beverly Hills gallery for four days before they go on the block Dec. 5-6.
Monroe, who died of a drug overdose at age 36 in 1962, willed "The Lost Archives" to her mentor, the legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg. He gave it to a friend he trusted would take proper care.
That friend's family, which Julien said wants to remain anonymous, obviously met Strasberg's expectations. Many of the letters look as pristine as the day their authors wrote them.
"Please, if I've ever made you cry or made you even more sadder, ever for a second, please forgive me, my perfect girl. I love you," Miller wrote in a pencil-scribbled P.S. at the bottom of a typewritten letter.
In a reply to one of his missives, Monroe takes issue with what the author of "Death of a Salesman" had called her nobility in handling a difficult childhood followed by public adulation that nearly crushed her.
"In other words, there was no choice to make, the same road was always before me," she wrote. "So for you to speak of my nobility, it really wasn't so noble."
She went on to say: "It's doubly difficult to understand that you, the most different, most beautiful human being, chose me to love."
Other items in the collection include a 19-minute reel of a movie made for Monroe after her final picture, 1961's "The Misfits," wrapped. It shows her frolicking happily at the beach with co-star Gable and others.
Notably, there's also a framed letter she kept on her coffee table from costume designer Cecil Beaton, who assured her she really was a fine actress.
"It's fantastic to see how loved she was," Nolan said. "Like you thought she was vulnerable and not loved and she craved love and she needed that reassurance. But she had it. She had it with Joe DiMaggio. She had it with Arthur Miller."
And, so it seems, she still has it with much of the rest of the world.

William Boyd writes Land Rover-sponsored book...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — Soon after turning out the latest James Bond novel, British author William Boyd agreed to write another thriller based on a world famous brand.
The Land Rover.
Boyd's nearly 17,000-word story, "The Vanishing Game," coming out Wednesday as a free download through Amazon.com, Apple and www.thevanishinggame.com , tells of a 35-year-old British actor named Alec Dunbar and the troubles he encounters when a pretty young woman convinces him to deliver a flask filled with clear liquid from London to Scotland. His transport is a certain four-wheel-drive vehicle.
Boyd, paid in the low six figures for the project, said he signed on because Land Rover made so few requests.
"They said they wanted an adventure and they said, 'Somewhere in this adventure it would be good if a Land Rover appeared.' But it was left entirely to me the extent I concentrated on that or made it fleeing and passing," the 62-year-old Britain-based author said during a recent telephone interview.
"I invented the story, I invented the characters, I invented the locations," said Boyd, whose novels include "The New Confessions" and "Brazzaville Beach."
Boyd's story can be read as a traditional book, or as an interactive narrative through the dedicated website. An audio track features a voiceover and soundtrack music. Photographs and moving images provide a backdrop to the words.
If "The Vanishing Game" itself cannot be called "a Land Rover story," the company provides other reminders. The Land Rover logo appears at the top of the screen and the occasional word or phrase, such as "river" or "cross country," links to a picture of a Land Rover or a real-life story about a Land Rover user.
The literary community has mostly shunned commercial endorsements, although there are precedents for Boyd's book. In 2001, Fay Weldon was commissioned by Bulgari to write "The Bulgari Connection," in which she worked in references to the jewelry company. Julia Alvarez wrote a poem for Absolut vodka and several authors, including Elmore Leonard and Lisa Scottoline, contributed essays for a 1990s Coca-Cola campaign. A recent e-book, Hillary Carlip's "Find Me I'm Yours," was funded in part by the makers of Sweet'N Low.
Scott Turow, whose best-sellers include "Presumed Innocent" and "The Burden of Proof," said he couldn't even "conceive" of working with a sponsor.
"I've declined to do direct endorsements of products a couple of times over the years — e.g. 'I'm Scott Turow and I like using this pen' — so I can't imagine what would persuade me to give up control over my work, even in this small way," Turow wrote in a recent email.
"That said, I don't criticize authors who go this road. It's a tough world out there for most writers, and anything that keeps them afloat is fine with me."
Ken Bracht, communications manager for Land Rover North America, said that Boyd was their preferred author early on, "given his popularity, reputation for adventure type stories" and the attention he was receiving at the time for his Bond novel, "Solo," published in September 2013. Boyd, in turn, said that the Land Rover was an "almost mythic vehicle" when he was growing up in Africa and that he had actually referred to a Land Rover in a novel he had been working on before learning of the current project.
"I have the central character using a Land Rover. It's virtually on page 1," Boyd said.
The author had little trouble devising a story, citing his background not just with the Bond book, but with movie scripts and a television series he has created and is currently writing, "Spy City," set in Berlin in the early 1960s. He said that "The Vanishing Game" was inspired in part by the late John Buchan, the Scottish novelist best known for the thriller "The Thirty-Nine Steps."
"I had already written a Buchanesque novel in 'Waiting for the Sunrise' and liked the idea of a young man in a predicament," he said. "I'm a bit of an old pro now. And when I set my mind to work I came up with this particular story."

Docs rush to help after India sterilization deaths...and
versions
NEW DELHI (AP) — The women were poor, from villages in central India where the promise of a few dollars is all but impossible to resist. Many had babies so young they were still nursing at their mothers' breasts.
The deaths of 12 women after they underwent sterilization procedures this week have raised serious ethical questions about India's drive to curb a booming population by paying women who get sterilized. The deaths also exposed the dangerous lack of oversight in India's $74 billion health care industry.
"We really are not paying enough attention to the quality of care in the public health system," said Jay Satia, an adviser to the Public Health Foundation of India.
The surgeon who performed the operations at the government-run "health camp" in Chhattisgarh state plowed through more than 80 surgeries in six hours — a clear breach of government protocol, which prohibits surgeons from performing more than 30 sterilizations in a day, a top medical official said Wednesday.
The surgeon, Dr. R.K. Gupta, was honored by the state government in January for performing over 50,000 laparoscopic tubectomies, said Dr. S.K. Mandal, the chief medical officer in Chhattisgarh.
"He's a very senior and respected surgeon," he said.
Mandal said he believed Gupta was under pressure to meet government-set targets for sterilizations.
"The people from the health department set up some targets and we have to achieve them by 31st March," Mandal said.
A spokeswoman for the federal health ministry said she was not aware of sterilization targets for states. India's government had said it stopped setting targets for sterilizing women in the 1990s.
But doctors and human rights workers have alleged for years that targets exist — which would lead to inevitable coercion in villages where most people have very limited access to both education and health care.
"The government of India denies that there are targets but they're clearly set and when it goes down to the district or village level that's a real problem. Extreme pressure is the crux of the problem," says Sona Sharma, joint director for advocacy at the New Delhi-based Population Foundation of India.
Mandal said that his state had a target of 220,000 sterilizations this year and Bilaspur, the district where the botched surgeries took place, had a target of about 15,000 surgeries.
Sterilization targets have a troubled history in India. In the 1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a policy of forcibly sterilizing men who had already fathered two children. Opponents at the time said the program targeted unmarried and poor men, with doctors given bonuses for operating on low-income patients.
Still, many experts caution that the sterilization surgeries can be a lifeline for poor women who are tired of multiple pregnancies or who want to take control of their fertility.
"It is convenient for many women. It's not ideal, but it's a one-time surgery and then you're done," says Sharma.
But she said incentive payments and government quotas make doctors pressure patients into surgery rather than advising them on contraception.
"Women are not informed about the choices in contraception they have. It's their right to know that other methods exist," she added.
Women in most Indian states are promised 1,400 rupees ($23) when they chose to have laparoscopic, or "keyhole," sterilization surgeries like those conducted in Bilaspur. The procedure is one of the most commonly performed minimally invasive surgeries, and is usually done under a local anesthetic.
India has one of the world's highest rates of sterilization among women, with about 37 percent undergoing such operations compared with 29 percent in China, according to 2006 statistics reported by the United Nations. About 4.6 million Indian women were sterilized in 2011 and 2012, according to the government.
In comparison, less than 1 percent of men choose to undergo vasectomies even though the cash incentive is higher at about 2,000 rupees ($33), says Sharma.
"They're worried about losing their virility. No amount of compensation will draw them to vasectomies."
A total of 83 women had the operations Saturday as part of the free sterilization campaign and were sent home that evening. But dozens later became ill and were rushed in ambulances to private hospitals in Bilaspur city. By Wednesday at least 12 women were dead. Dozens more are hospitalized, and at least 13 are fighting for their lives.
Outside the hospital, the relatives and young children of the dead women wailed or looked frozen in shock.
"The families of at least 10 women said that they had young babies, most of them under 6 months old, and were still being breastfed. Now the mothers are dead," said Kamlesh Pandey, a local journalist based in Bilaspur.
One man told The Indian Express newspaper that his sister-in-law had just given birth and did not want to sterilization surgery but was bullied into it by local officials.
"They said nothing would happen. It was a minor surgery," Mahesh Suryavanshi said.
Yet Gupta, the surgeon, was performing operations in a private clinic that wasn't even registered with the government and in an operating theater that Mandal says should never have been used.
The apparent cause of death was either blood poisoning or hemorrhagic shock, which occurs when a person has lost too much blood, state deputy health director Amar Singh said.
The Chhattisgarh state government sent a plane to New Delhi to pick up seven doctors to help treat the patients.
"Whatever treatment is being provided to the victims is good," said Dr. Anjan Trikha of the Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Science, speaking with reporters at one of the hospitals in Bilaspur.
He declined to say anything more until the results of autopsies are released.
The government has also started a criminal investigation into Gupta's conduct and said that the victims' families would each receive about $6,600 in compensation. Four government doctors, including Gupta and the district's chief medical officer, have been suspended.

California nurses strike over patient care  Ebola... 
KRISTIN J. BENDER | November 12, 2014 06:59 AM EST | Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As many as 18,000 nurses went on strike Tuesday and picketed in front of Kaiser Permanente facilities in Northern California to express their concerns about patient-care standards and Ebola.
The nurses, who are in the midst of contract negotiations, held red and yellow "strike for health and safety" picket signs. The two-day strike was expected to affect at least 21 Kaiser hospitals and 35 clinics and last until 7 a.m. Thursday.
Union officials said nurses are striking over claims there has been an erosion of patient-care standards in Kaiser facilities for months and that the company has failed to adopt optimal safeguards for Ebola.
"The nurses are telling story upon story of the lack of safety for patients, the lack of concern for patients," RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses Association, the union representing the striking nurses, said. "This isn't about money. This is about something far deeper."
Kaiser said calling a strike now, "just as we are entering flu season, and when the nation and our members are concerned about the risk of Ebola, seems particularly irresponsible."
"The fact is, the various reasons the union leaders are giving for walking out are not supported by the facts — either in our medical centers or at the bargaining table," Kaiser said in a statement.
The health care provider said it is well-equipped to handle any potential Ebola cases.
Kaiser will remain open during the strike, though some elective procedures and routine appointments may be rescheduled, company officials said. Replacement nurses are in place, union officials said.
California Hospital Association spokeswoman Jan Emerson-Shea said the nurses' union, which has been in contract talks since July, is using the crisis to further its own agenda. The association represents and advocates for California hospitals, patients and communities.
"The union is in contact negotiations with the hospitals they are striking. They are using Ebola as a ruse," she said Monday.
The association is working with federal, state and local agencies to assure the public that universal precautions are in place to screen and identify infectious diseases, Emerson-Shea said.
There are no confirmed cases of Ebola in California.

Indian stocks ride high on global liquidityUpdated: November 10, 2014 03:00 IST
Indian stocks ride high on global liquidity
C. R. L. Narasimhan
market and exchange
In an ideal situation, the stock indices should reflect the real economy
The relentless climb of the stock market indices — the Sensex and the Nifty — invites a few comments. On November 5, the Sensex set a new record, when it crossed 28,000. It is still hovering around those levels. Normal profit-taking can lead to corrections, but the overall trend seems positive. It is a sign of the times that the record-breaking performance of the markets hardly elicits the excitement that was customary during the previous leaps of the indices. Evidently, not only the market participants but the public at large seem to take these high valuations for granted.
That could be a facile, even costly assumption. The factors that are driving up share prices need to be scrutinised constantly. A number of hypotheses trying to explain today’s markets fall flat even on a cursory scrutiny.
Recommendations to retail investors from a variety of analysts, brokers and the like reek of over optimism. Such exaggerated forecasts have been common at times like these — when calculated reasoning is replaced by unjustified optimism. The danger lies in not only retail investors entering the stock exchanges at these levels. Even the officially recommended avenues for them, mutual funds, have been capitalising on the prevailing sentiment by some aggressive selling. A number of new fund offerings (NFOs), for instance, can deliver, if at all, only over the long-run. They will be investing the money collected at the currently high stock prices. To suggest that the new funds will start reflecting the current Sensex levels is downright dangerous.
The last budget changed the rules for taxing debt funds, thereby, providing a disincentive to their investors. Those who want to invest in the share market are by default encouraged to put their money in riskier equities. That, of course, was not what the Finance Minister intended. Debt funds such as fixed maturity plans were proving to be a hit by exploiting the tax advantage that obtained for investors in debt instruments. Bank deposits fared poorly on a comparative basis. One has to perforce look at the real reasons behind the high stock markets. The Modi factor is no doubt a positive factor but its most beneficial consequence has been to lift the prevailing mood. The advent of a stable, cohesive government at the Centre is an extremely favourable development.
In the short period it has been in power the government has demonstrated a capacity for being decisive — deregulating diesel prices, paving the way for coal mine auctions to name a few moves to remove the policy logjam. Yet as the Finance Minister has been saying recently economic reforms are a long range process. Even a seminal reform such as the GST will take time before it enters the statute books despite all these years of discussions and consensus building.
In an ideal situation, the stock indices should reflect the real economy. No one claims that in the present context the high stock prices indicate or are a harbinger of robust economic growth. For more than two years, the Indian economy has been growing at below 5 per cent. Growth prognosis for the current year (2014-15) at around 5.5 to 6 per cent sounds better, but hardly at levels that would set the markets on fire. Earnings of listed companies, though improving, are not good enough to justify their market valuations.
So it is once again the case of surging global liquidity lifting stock prices in India and other emerging economies. The role of foreign institutional investors has been crucial but overdependence on these flows can be dangerous. For, these fleet-footed investors can just as easily reverse directions. Over the past ten days, there have been developments in two developed economies that have had a direct bearing on the Indian markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve wound down its massive quantitative easing (QE) programme, which involved purchase of long–dated bonds. The money that was released boosted reserve money and kept interest rates low. The phasing out of this ultrasoft monetary policy was entirely expected. India has been much better prepared than it was when the Fed announced its intention to withdraw the policy in instalments in September, 2013.
A termination of the ultrasoft monetary policy means two or three things — no longer will funds flow as freely into India as before; the Fed withdrew the policy only after it was satisfied with the recovery in the U.S. in terms of employment and economic growth; that should normally signal a return of investors to the U.S. That has not happened probably because the Fed has promised to keep the interest rate low. Those reasons alone may not fully explain the equanimity with which the Indian financial markets have reacted to news of the termination of America’s ultrasoft policy. Quite unexpectedly, Bank of Japan announced its decision to expand its bond-buying programme — to 80 trillion yen a year from the present 60 to 70 trillion yen. The stated objective is to fight deflation. There is no doubt at all that a portion of the funds released in Japan will seek investment in Indian stocks. This again may not be a wholly welcome development from the point of view of India’s macroeconomic management.
Investors whether in Japan or the U.S. are for the short-term. The two countries have had their own purely domestic reasons — for the U.S. to end an unorthodox policy and for Japan to expand it. This point should never be ignored by India.

The Financial Conduct AuthorityFCA confirms price cap rules for payday lenders
Published: 11/11/2014   Last Modified : 17/11/2014
People using payday lenders and other providers of high-cost short-term credit will see the cost of borrowing fall and will never have to pay back more than double what they originally borrowed, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed today.
Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive officer, said:
'I am confident that the new rules strike the right balance for firms and consumers. If the price cap was any lower, then we risk not having a viable market, any higher and there would not be adequate protection for borrowers.
'For people who struggle to repay, we believe the new rules will put an end to spiralling payday debts. For most of the borrowers who do pay back their loans on time, the cap on fees and charges represents substantial protections.'
The FCA published its proposals for a payday loan price cap in July. The price cap structure and levels remain unchanged following the consultation. These are:
Initial cost cap of 0.8% per day - Lowers the cost for most borrowers. For all high-cost short-term credit loans, interest and fees must not exceed 0.8% per day of the amount borrowed.
Fixed default fees capped at £15 - Protects borrowers struggling to repay. If borrowers do not repay their loans on time, default charges must not exceed £15. Interest on unpaid balances and default charges must not exceed the initial rate. 
Total cost cap of 100% - Protects borrowers from escalating debts. Borrowers must never have to pay back more in fees and interest than the amount borrowed.
From 2 January 2015, no borrower will ever pay back more than twice what they borrowed, and someone taking out a loan for 30 days and repaying on time will not pay more than £24 in fees and charges per £100 borrowed.
Price cap consultation, further analysis
The FCA consulted widely on the proposed price cap with various stakeholders, including industry and consumer groups, professional bodies and academics.
In July, the FCA estimated that the effect of the price cap would be that 11% of current borrowers would no longer have access to payday loans after 2 January 2015.
In the first five months of FCA regulation of consumer credit , the number of loans and the amount borrowed has dropped by 35%.  To take account of this, FCA has collected additional information from firms and revised its estimates of the impact on market exit and loss of access to credit. We now estimate 7 % of current borrowers may not have access to payday loans - some 70,000 people. These are people who are likely to have been in a worse situation if they had been granted a loan. So the price cap protects them. 
In the July consultation paper the FCA said it expected to see more than 90% of firms participating in real-time data sharing. Recent progress means that participation in real-time data sharing is in line with our expectations. Therefore the FCA is not proposing to consult on rules about this at this time.  The progress made will be kept under review.
The final policy statement and rules . The price cap will be reviewed in 2017.
Notes to editors
Price cap on high-cost short-term credit: Policy Statement 14/16
Proposals consulted on: position unchanged
The cap will have three components: an initial cost cap; a cap on default fees and interest; and a total cost cap.
View full sized image PDF
Initial cost cap
The initial cost cap will be set at 0.8% of the outstanding principal per day, on all interest and fees charged during the loan and when refinancing. 
Firms can structure their charges under this cap in any way they choose, for example, a portion could be upfront or rollover fees.
Default cap
The cap on default charges will be £15. 
Interest can continue to be charged but at no higher rate than the initial cost cap (calculated per day on the outstanding principal and fixed default charges).
Total cost cap
The total cost cap will be 100% of the total amount borrowed, applying to all interest, fees and charges.
Application of the cap
It will apply to high-cost short-term credit (HCSTC) as defined in our current CONC rules.
The cap will cover debt collection, debt administration and other ancillary charges; and charges for credit broking for a firm in the same group or where the broker shares revenue with the lender. 
Repeat borrowing
The price cap will apply to each loan agreement, and so to repeat borrowing in the same way as for a first loan.
Data sharing
Firms engaging in this market should be participating in real-time data sharing, so that the vast majority of loans are reported in real-time. 
Recent progress is in line with our expectations. This will be kept under review.
Supervision
Our supervisory approach will follow our standard model.  
E-Commerce Directive (ECD)
UK-based debt collectors will be prevented from collecting debts arising under HCSTC agreements entered into by incoming ECD lenders whose charges exceed the price cap.
UK-based debt administrators will not be able to enforce or exercise rights on behalf of a lender under such HCSTC agreements.
The Treasury has already announced its intention to lay before Parliament, ahead of the cap coming into effect on 2 January, an Order to confer a power on the FCA allowing us to take action if an incoming firm abuses the EU right of free movement by establishing in another member state directing all or most of its activities into the UK, with a view to avoiding rules that would apply if it had been established in another member state.
Review period
There will be a review of the price cap in the first half of 2017.
Proposals consulted on: changes and clarifications made
Application of the cap to loans made before January 2015
We have adjusted the rules so that if an HCSTC agreement is modified after 2 January 2015, charges imposed before 2 January must be taken together with charges imposed after that date for the calculation of the cap.
Calculation of the cap
We have amended the rules to cover calculation of the cap when loans are refinanced.
Unenforceability
We have clarified that when an agreement is unenforceable, consumers still have a statutory duty to repay the principal, once a firm has repaid the interest or charges to the consumer, or indicated that there are no charges to repay. Customers must repay within a reasonable period. Lenders cannot make a demand in less than 30 days. We give guidance on what is reasonable in different circumstances.
Repeat borrowing
We will do further work to assess the impact of repeat borrowing and whether firms are adequately assessing affordability.
The Money Advice Service is publishing new advice to help consumers who are considering taking out payday loans.
Firms must be authorised by the FCA, or have interim permission, to carry out consumer credit activities. Firms with interim permission need to apply for authorisation in an allocated application period which last for three months and run from 1 October 2014 to 31 March 2016.
The FCA took over responsibility for the regulation of 50,000 consumer credit firms from the Office of Fair Trading on 1 April 2014.
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 gives the FCA powers to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by The Criminal Justice Act 1993.
On the 1 April 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).

Super Majority Without The Super Powerreddit
A super majority sounds like a big deal, doesn't it? For example, a super majority of two-thirds is what is needed for Congress to override a legislative veto by the President. As decision-making authority goes, that two-thirds requisite is a high bar to reach. And as a result, the situation doesn't happen very often. Of the more than 2,500 bills vetoed in the history of the United States, Congress has overridden the President less than five percent of time.
An even larger super majority already exists in the U.S. economy and it manifests itself in households across the country. But this super majority doesn't wield the power you might expect.
More than 75 percent of women are the primary shopper for their household. Some studies put the figure even higher at 85 percent. With more than 115 million households in the U.S., that is a lot of purchasing decisions and a lot of purchasing power. We are not just talking about purchasing groceries, clothes and healthcare services; women are making the decisions on big-ticket items such as homes, cars and vacations. Market estimates put the purchasing power of women in America at somewhere between $5 and $15 trillion. That's real money no matter which number you believe. One could easily argue that women are the driving force - the Super Power - behind the consumer economy.
But that power isn't reflected in corporate boardrooms. Women represent only 5.2 percent of CEO positions and 16.9 percent of board seats on Fortune 500 companies. This is an interesting juxtaposition to unpack.
The Committee for Economic Development issued a thought-provoking report in 2012 titled, " Fulfilling the Promise: How More Women on Corporate Boards Would Make America and American Companies More Competitive ." Based on the work of a subcommittee, it urged business leaders to focus on gender equity at all levels, but particularly at the board level. Rather than dwell on the oft-raised question of whether women on boards signifies better financial performance for organizations, the report focused on the competitiveness agenda. Specifically, the business case to be made for greater gender diversity on boards based on "the competition for talent and the need for boards to be more attuned to consumers, suppliers and other stakeholders."
From a common sense perspective, having more women in senior management and on boards is a competitive necessity. Think about it. If women make the majority of purchase decisions, then gender-diversity in the C-suite, as well as on boards, would help make companies more responsive to the market because they understand the demographic. After all, they are the demographic!
Let me focus on corporate boards for a moment. There is a growing body of research in this space that supports a strong correlation between female representation on boards and financial performance, but does not prove causality. The question is, of course, would the businesses studied have delivered the same results irrespective of their board composition? Having said that, based on the facts, the strength of the correlation is hard to ignore. Additionally, the research does support the hypothesis that women on boards contribute to stronger corporate governance. And, of course, there is the competitiveness agenda - clearly a compelling rationale for more women on boards.
Numerous studies also document the positive correlation between gender-diverse senior management teams and overall organizational performance.
Women hold the super majority on the purse strings and that should, at the very least, translate into gender parity in senior management and on boards. Recognizing the power of the purse and the women who carry them should be a priority for companies if they are going to tap their respective market's full potential. Corporate America would be smart to follow the money.

It s Showtime! One Key to Continual Motivationreddit
Let me start with two well-known phrases:
1. "All the world's a stage" is the phrase that begins a monologue from William Shakespeare's As You like It.
2. "The show must go on" is a phrase in show business, meaning that regardless of what happens, whatever show has been planned still has to be staged for the waiting patrons.
Until recently, I always had a dilemma regarding the "stage" of business. As an executive educator, who helps successful leaders achieve a positive change in behavior, I, in a way, teach people how to act.
So here's the dilemma: When is acting being professional? When is acting being phony? I want to help leaders learn how to be great performers, but I never believe that they should be phonies. How can I, as a coach, understand the difference?
And what makes you "buy" your boss's, colleague's, subordinate's or even a salesperson's "act?" The answer is we buy someone's act when they truly love their profession. We are with them when their "act" is part of the fabric of who, and what they are -- and we can feel it in our interactions with them.
Let me give you two divergent examples.
First, one of the greatest leaders I know is Frances Hesselbein, the former executive director of the Girl Scouts of America and now chairman of the Leader to Leader Institute. I am not alone in my assessment of her talents. Peter Drucker once noted that she was perhaps the most effective executive he had ever met. As a tribute to her leadership skills, President Clinton awarded Frances with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award that can be given to a U.S. civilian.
I am deeply honored that Frances is also one of my best friends. Like all humans, Frances faces the same problems we all face. She has lived through health problems, tragedies with friends and family issues. And, like all great professionals, when it is time for Frances to work, she is always there. I have seen her turn down an invitation from the U.S. president because she had already committed to a talk (at no fee) for a non-profit organization in a small town. When she makes a commitment, if it is humanly possible to be there, she delivers. It doesn't matter that a "better deal" came along later. She not only makes an appearance, she is upbeat and positive, she is inspirational and she gets the job done.
For Frances, the show must go on, and she takes the stage with love, heart and passion.  She believes in the core of her soul in what she is doing and anyone around her feels it and knows it. Simply put, everyone buys her act -- because her act is truly Frances.
My second example is my client Ted, who helped me answer my dilemma question. I worked with him for a year, trying to help him fit in a corporate culture where he really didn't belong. At the end of the year, I finally said, "Why don't you leave? You are so miserable that you are starting to depress me!"
He saw the light, left the company and is now doing something he loves. There was nothing wrong with the company. There was nothing wrong with Ted. He just didn't belong there. It wasn't him.
In the case of Ted, when his show had to go on, he was simply going through the motions. When he took the stage, people around him did not truly buy his act -- and Ted did not really buy his own act.
I learned through Ted that despite his greatest efforts, he was being phony when he did not love his work.  And loving your work is what makes great performers rise to the occasion.
On Broadway -- Their Act Is No Act
This is why great Broadway performers are able to pour their hearts into each production. At times they overcome headaches, family problems and more. Because, the show must go on.
Like great actors, inspirational leaders sometimes need to be consummate performers. When they need to motivate and inspire people, they do it. And we are inspired (or buy their act) because they are 100 percent invested in their work and the cause.
Believe in Your Act
If you are in the right job in the right company, and you are learning how to perform to the best of your ability, you are being a true professional. If you are in the wrong job in the wrong company and you learn to act so that you can better fit in, you are just being a better phony. It still isn't you out there.
Today, Ted is a lot happier. He spends his time thinking up creative ideas in his new company, and he's having a ball. He is not only adding value for the company, he is also adding value for the world.
Think about your job. As a professional, is your job consistent with the person you want to be?
If the answer is "yes", be like Frances Hesselbein. Put on a great show. Be the consummate professional. Learn to keep developing your ability to perform, so you can get even better than you are today. If you love what you do, a great coach might even help you get better.
Every day we all take the stage. And, when you take the stage and the show must go on -- are people buying your act? And, most of all are you buying your own act?
If the answer is "no", change jobs as soon as you can. Why bother to become a better phony? Even if you do get a coach and learn to modify your behavior, it won't count for much. Why? It won't really be you.

US Commodity Futures Trading CommissionRELEASE: pr7056-14
November 12, 2014
CFTC Orders Five Banks to Pay over $1.4 Billion in Penalties for Attempted Manipulation of Foreign Exchange Benchmark Rates
Citibank, HSBC, JPMorgan, RBS, and UBS Coordinated Trading with Other Banks in Private Chat Rooms in Their Attempts to Manipulate
Washington, DC – The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued five Orders filing and settling charges against Citibank N.A. (Citibank), HSBC Bank plc (HSBC), JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (JPMorgan), The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS) and UBS AG (UBS) (collectively, the Banks) for attempted manipulation of, and for aiding and abetting other banks’ attempts to manipulate, global foreign exchange (FX) benchmark rates to benefit the positions of certain traders.
The Orders collectively impose over $1.4 billion in civil monetary penalties, specifically: $310 million each for Citibank and JPMorgan, $290 million each for RBS and UBS, and $275 million for HSBC.
The Orders also require the Banks to cease and desist from further violations, and take specified steps to implement and strengthen their internal controls and procedures, including the supervision of their FX traders, to ensure the integrity of their participation in the fixing of foreign exchange benchmark rates and internal and external communications by traders.  The relevant period of conduct varies across the Banks, with conduct commencing for certain banks in 2009, and for each bank, continuing into 2012.
Aitan Goelman, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement, stated: “The setting of a benchmark rate is not simply another opportunity for banks to earn a profit.  Countless individuals and companies around the world rely on these rates to settle financial contracts, and this reliance is premised on faith in the fundamental integrity of these benchmarks.  The market only works if people have confidence that the process of setting these benchmarks is fair, not corrupted by manipulation by some of the biggest banks in the world.”
According to the Orders, one of the primary benchmarks that the FX traders attempted to manipulate was the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates (WM/R Rates).  The WM/R Rates, the most widely referenced FX benchmark rates in the United States and globally, are used to establish the relative values of different currencies, which reflect the rates at which one currency is exchanged for another currency.  FX benchmark rates, such as the WM/R Rates, are used for pricing of cross-currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps, spot transactions, forwards, options, futures and other financial derivative instruments. The most actively traded currency pairs are the Euro/U.S. Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen, and British Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar.  Accordingly, the integrity of the WM/R Rates and other FX benchmarks is critical to the integrity of the markets in the United States and around the world.
The Orders find that certain FX traders at the Banks coordinated their trading with traders at other banks in their attempts to manipulate the FX benchmark rates, including the 4 p.m. WM/R fix.  FX traders at the Banks used private chat rooms to communicate and plan their attempts to manipulate the FX benchmark rates.  In these chat rooms, FX traders at the Banks disclosed confidential customer order information and trading positions, altered trading positions to accommodate the interests of the collective group, and agreed on trading strategies as part of an effort by the group to attempt to manipulate certain FX benchmark rates.  These chat rooms were sometimes exclusive and invitation only.  (Examples of the coordinating chats are attached under Related Links.)
The Orders also find that the Banks failed to adequately assess the risks associated with their FX traders participating in the fixing of certain FX benchmark rates and lacked adequate internal controls in order to prevent improper communications by traders.  In addition, the Banks lacked sufficient policies, procedures and training specifically governing participation in trading around the FX benchmarks rates; and had inadequate policies pertaining to, or sufficient oversight of, their FX traders’ use of chat rooms or other electronic messaging.
According to the Orders, some of this conduct occurred during the same period that the Banks were on notice that the CFTC and other regulators were investigating attempts by certain banks to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interest rate benchmarks.  The Commission has taken enforcement action against UBS and RBS (among other banks and inter-dealer brokers) in connection with LIBOR and other interest rate benchmarks. (See information below.)
The Orders recognize the significant cooperation of Citibank, HSBC, JPMorgan, RBS, and UBS with the CFTC during the investigation of this matter.  In the UBS Order, the CFTC also recognizes that UBS was the first bank to report this misconduct to the CFTC.
In related matters, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued Final Notices regarding enforcement actions against the Banks and imposing collectively penalties of £1,114,918,000 (approximately $1.7 billion), and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has issued an order resolving proceedings against and requiring disgorgement from UBS AG.
The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the invaluable assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the FCA, and FINMA.
CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for these cases are Robert Howell, Jonathan Huth, Traci Rodriguez, Jennifer Smiley, David Terrell, Melissa Glasbrenner, Heather Johnson, Jordon Grimm, Elizabeth Streit, and Gretchen L. Lowe.
* * * * *
With these Orders, since June 2012, the CFTC has imposed penalties of over $3.34 billion on entities relating to acts of attempted manipulation, completed manipulation, and/or false reporting with respect to global benchmarks. See In re Lloyds’ Banking Group, PLC , CFTC Docket No. 14-18 (July 28, 2014)($105 million)(CFTC Press Release 6966-14 ); (In re RP Martin Holdings Limited and Martin Brokers (UK) Ltd., CFTC Docket No. 14-16 (May 15, 2014) ($1.2 Million penalty) (CFTC Press Release 6930-14 ); In re Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. (Rabobank), CFTC Docket No. 14-02, (October 29, 2013) ($475 Million penalty) (CFTC Press Release 6752-13 ); In re ICAP Europe Limited, CFTC Docket No. 13-38 (September 25, 2013) ($65 Million penalty) (CFTC Press Release 6708-13 ); In re The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and RBS Securities Japan Limited, CFTC Docket No. 13-14 (February 6, 2013) ($325 Million penalty) (CFTC Press Release 6510-13 ); In re UBS AG and UBS Securities Japan Co., Ltd., CFTC Docket No. 13-09) (December 19, 2012) ($700 Million penalty) (CFTC Press Release 6472-12 ); In re Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and Barclays Capital Inc., CFTC Docket No. 12-25 (June 27, 2012) ($200 million penalty) (CFTC Press Release 6289-12 ).  In these actions, the CFTC ordered each institution to undertake specific steps to ensure the integrity and reliability of the benchmark interest rates.

What is extraordinary is the arroganceForex Fines
November 12, 2014 by Louise
Both the Financial Conduct Authority and the American CFTC have come out with fines for forex rigging this morning.  The UK regulator has fined five banks £1.1bn and the US fined the same five – JPMorgan, Citigroup, UBS, RBS and HSBC –  $1.4bn.  Barclays is still in negotiation which may mean it gets a higher penalty.  The FCA notes that these five banks will pay 30% less than the full cost for early settlement.
What is extraordinary is the arrogance and sheer stupidity of these traders (or though maybe that is not so extraordinary).  The CFTC notes that some of the manipulation occurred after the LIBOR investigation had begun.   These investigations also took place after the financial crisis hit when it was pretty clear that more regulatory oversight was coming to the industry.  Banks caused the collapse of the global economy and had to be bailed up by taxpayer.  A regulatory backlash was clearly coming.  Politicians and regulators had clearly said so.  And yet the illegal and immoral manipulation of markets had continued.  I thought these were supposed to be the masters of the universe? Brilliantly clever individuals who were worth their multi million pound bonuses.  And yet they continued their behaviour despite the clear signs they were likely to be discovered.  Does that suggest that maybe they were not so brilliant after all but found themselves in a market that could be manipulated to make millions?
Also the names they called each other are so juvenile: “the 3 musketeers, the A-team, the players”.  They sound like kids let lose in a terribly expensive sweetie shop.  There are not the monikers of serious financial professionals..  More like sniggering school boys doing naughty things…
The FCA talks of “poor practice” “oversight of traders insufficient” “the right values and culture not embedded”, “putting bank’s interests above that of clients”.  All the stuff we have heard before.  Traders from different banks shared information on confidential client trades via private chat rooms in order to profit. How will all the bank’s clients – companies that need to change currencies to trade around the world – will feel that?  I would love to know what the head of Unilever’s treasury function is thinking today.. Or Apple or Coca Cola, or any of the other large multi nationals?
I also would love to see some of these private chats.  WE know from LIBOR that they can be hilarious, albeit depressingly so.  They are also a great deflator of the egos of those who work in finance and justify their multi million dollar salaries (although there are clearly a lot less of them now).
I also finally note that no one has ended up in prison and I have had said many times before this creates moral hazard.  If the only downside is that the bank pays a massive fine, then why won’t immoral traders repeat this behaviour in the future?  And some of those attracted to this industry are those that will  find a way round the rules to profit personally.  I hope the SFO does make some charges stick but its track recored suggest not (even with the support of Mr Osborne).  Bank fines also ultimately cost the economy and taxpayers.  If banks are fined then they have less capital to lend in the real economy via loans to businesses and mortgages for households.  And thanks to leverage, a half a billion pound fine can reduce lenmding by as much as £10bn. And of course it is bank profits that are hit, therefore the bank share price also hit and therefore the pension funds and ISAs that the population own.
All so depressingly familiar.

Sainsbury s says about 75%Sainsbury's mothballs shop plans and reports fall in sales
Sainsbury's expects like-for-like sales in the supermarket sector to be negative "for the next few years"
Sainsbury's has reined back plans for new stores and said the change in plans has affected its balance sheet.
The supermarket chain took a charge of £287m because some sites will no longer be developed.
The firm reported a half-year loss before tax of £290m and said that like-for-like sales had fallen 2.1% during the period.
It expects like-for-like sales in the sector to be negative "for the next few years".
The new chief executive of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, explains the decision
"We anticipate the next couple of years in our industry will be extremely challenging," Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The reality is we are seeing deflation for the first time in probably around 10 years," he said.
A change in shopping habits was affecting supermarket sales, Sainsbury's added.
People were shopping more frequently and using online, convenience and discount retailers more, it said.
Sainsbury's said it had "robust plans to address this challenge", including investing £150m in price cuts.

After an initial spike, Sainsbury's shares were down over 5% at one point in morning trading before recovering to end at 266p, giving a 1% loss on the day.
Charges
In the half-year, Sainsbury's said it had taken total one-off charges of £633m, including £287m for altering its store opening plans.
"We are acknowledging we are not going to build out as many large supermarkets as we were anticipating, so that results in the fact that the land becomes less valuable," Mr Coupe said.
About 40 supermarket developments across the UK will now not go ahead, the BBC understands.
The firm also took a charge of £341m in relation to existing unprofitable and marginally profitable trading shops.
Price war
Supermarkets in the UK are engaged in a bitter price war that has pushed the grocery market into deflation, according to October figures from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.
Sainsbury's lost market share to rivals including fellow supermarket giant Asda and discounters Aldi and Lidl, Kantar said.
As part of its strategy to take on rivals, Sainsbury's said it would reduce spending and profitability.
The company will maintain its dividend at 5p per share for the current year.
It will reduce capital expenditure to between £500m and £550m a year over the next three years.
Sainsbury's will continue to devote more of its store space to non-food items, including clothing, cookware, homeware and seasonal products.
In addition, it will open 500,000 sq ft of space over the next two years and 350,000 sq ft in its 2017-18 year.
New space will include eight new supermarkets over the next three years, as well as four redevelopments of existing stores.

The supermarket has maintainedSainsbury's mothballs shop plans and reports fall in sales
Sainsbury's expects like-for-like sales in the supermarket sector to be negative "for the next few years"
Sainsbury's has reined back plans for new stores and said the change in plans has affected its balance sheet.
The supermarket chain took a charge of £287m because some sites will no longer be developed.
The firm reported a half-year loss before tax of £290m and said that like-for-like sales had fallen 2.1% during the period.
It expects like-for-like sales in the sector to be negative "for the next few years".
The new chief executive of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, explains the decision
"We anticipate the next couple of years in our industry will be extremely challenging," Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The reality is we are seeing deflation for the first time in probably around 10 years," he said.
A change in shopping habits was affecting supermarket sales, Sainsbury's added.
People were shopping more frequently and using online, convenience and discount retailers more, it said.
Sainsbury's said it had "robust plans to address this challenge", including investing £150m in price cuts.

After an initial spike, Sainsbury's shares were down over 5% at one point in morning trading before recovering to end at 266p, giving a 1% loss on the day.
Charges
In the half-year, Sainsbury's said it had taken total one-off charges of £633m, including £287m for altering its store opening plans.
"We are acknowledging we are not going to build out as many large supermarkets as we were anticipating, so that results in the fact that the land becomes less valuable," Mr Coupe said.
About 40 supermarket developments across the UK will now not go ahead, the BBC understands.
The firm also took a charge of £341m in relation to existing unprofitable and marginally profitable trading shops.
Price war
Supermarkets in the UK are engaged in a bitter price war that has pushed the grocery market into deflation, according to October figures from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.
Sainsbury's lost market share to rivals including fellow supermarket giant Asda and discounters Aldi and Lidl, Kantar said.
As part of its strategy to take on rivals, Sainsbury's said it would reduce spending and profitability.
The company will maintain its dividend at 5p per share for the current year.
It will reduce capital expenditure to between £500m and £550m a year over the next three years.
Sainsbury's will continue to devote more of its store space to non-food items, including clothing, cookware, homeware and seasonal products.
In addition, it will open 500,000 sq ft of space over the next two years and 350,000 sq ft in its 2017-18 year.

The FCA gives some fascinating insightFCA fines five banks £1.1 billion for FX failings and announces industry-wide remediation programme
Published: 12/11/2014   Last Modified : 13/11/2014
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has imposed fines totalling £1,114,918,000 ($1.7 billion) on five banks for failing to control business practices in their G10 spot foreign exchange (FX) trading operations: Citibank N.A. £225,575,000 ($358 million), HSBC Bank Plc £216,363,000 ($343 million), JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. £222,166,000 ($352 million), The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc £217,000,000 ($344 million) and UBS AG £233,814,000 ($371 million) (‘the Banks’).
The G10 spot FX market is a systemically important financial market. At the heart of today’s action is our finding that the failings at these Banks undermine confidence in the UK financial system and put its integrity at risk.
In relation to Barclays Bank Plc, we will progress our investigation into that firm which will cover its G10 spot FX trading business and also wider FX business areas.
In addition to taking enforcement action against and investigating the six firms where we found the worst misconduct, we are launching an industry-wide remediation programme to ensure firms address the root causes of these failings and drive up standards across the market. We will require senior management at firms to take responsibility for delivering the necessary changes and attest that this work has been completed.
This complements our ongoing supervisory work and the wider reforms to the fixed income, commodity and currency markets which are the subject of the UK Fair and Effective Markets Review.
Between 1 January 2008 and 15 October 2013, ineffective controls at the Banks allowed G10 spot FX traders to put their Banks’ interests ahead of those of their clients, other market participants and the wider UK financial system. The Banks failed to manage obvious risks around confidentiality, conflicts of interest and trading conduct.
These failings allowed traders at those Banks to behave unacceptably. They shared information about clients’ activities which they had been trusted to keep confidential and attempted to manipulate G10 spot FX currency rates, including in collusion with traders at other firms, in a way that could disadvantage those clients and the market.
Today’s fines are the largest ever imposed by the FCA, or its predecessor the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and this is the first time the FCA has pursued a settlement with a group of banks in this way. We have worked closely with other regulators in the UK, Europe and the US: today the Swiss regulator, FINMA, has disgorged CHF 134 million ($138 million) from UBS AG; and, in the US, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (‘the CFTC’) has imposed a total financial penalty of over $1.4 billion on the Banks and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (‘the OCC’) has imposed a total financial penalty of $700 million on Citibank N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.
Since Libor general improvements have been made across the financial services industry, and some remedial action was taken by the Banks fined today. However, despite our well-publicised action in relation to Libor and the systemic importance of the G10 spot FX market, the Banks failed to take adequate action to address the underlying root causes of the failings in that business.
Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, said:
“The FCA does not tolerate conduct which imperils market integrity or the wider UK financial system. Today’s record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right. They must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits or leave the ethics of their conduct to compliance to worry about. Senior management commitments to change need to become a reality in every area of their business.
“But this is not just about enforcement action. It is about a combination of actions aimed at driving up market standards across the industry. All firms need to work with us to deliver real and lasting change to the culture of the trading floor. This is essential to restoring the public’s trust in financial services and London maintaining its position as a strong and competitive financial centre.”
Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime, said:
“Firms could have been in no doubt, especially after Libor, that failing to take steps to tackle the consequences of a free for all culture on their trading floors was unacceptable. This is not about having armies of compliance staff ticking boxes. It is about firms understanding, and managing, the risks their conduct might pose to markets. Where problems are identified we expect firms to deal with those quickly, decisively and effectively and to make sure they apply the lessons across their business.  If they fail to do so they will continue to face significant regulatory and reputational costs.”
Clive Adamson, the FCA’s director of supervision, said:
“The supervisory measures that we are announcing today will help make sure that real cultural change is delivered across the industry, and that senior management take responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of integrity operate across all of their trading businesses.”
The FX Market  
The FX market is one of the largest and most liquid markets in the world with a daily average turnover of $5.3 trillion, 40% of which takes place in London. The spot FX market is a wholesale financial market and spot FX benchmarks (also known as “fixes”) are used to establish the relative value of two currencies.  Fixes are used by a wide range of financial and non-financial companies, for example to help value assets or manage currency risk.
The FCA’s investigation focused on the G10 currencies, which are the most widely-used and systemically important, and on the 4pm WM Reuters and 1:15pm European Central Bank fixes.
The FCA’s findings
Today’s action shows that we will not tolerate conduct that undermines the integrity of this crucial market or the wider UK financial system.
We expect firms to identify, assess and manage appropriately the risks that their business poses to the markets in which they operate and to preserve market integrity, whether or not those markets are regulated. Although there are no specific rules governing the unregulated spot FX market, the importance of managing risks associated with spot FX business through effective systems and controls is widely recognised in industry codes.
We found that between 1 January 2008 and 15 October 2013 the Banks did not exercise adequate and effective control over their G10 spot FX trading businesses. For example policies were high level and firm-wide in nature, there was insufficient training and guidance on how these policies applied to this business, oversight of G10 spot FX traders’ conduct was insufficient, and monitoring was not designed to identify the behaviours found in our investigation.
The right values and culture were not sufficiently embedded in the Banks’ G10 spot FX businesses which resulted in those businesses acting in the Banks’ own interests without proper regard for the interests of their clients, other market participants or the wider UK financial system.
Traders at different Banks formed tight knit groups in which information was shared about client activity, including using code names to identify clients without naming them. These groups were described as, for example, “the players”, “the 3 musketeers”, “1 team, 1 dream”, “a co-operative” and “the A-team”.
Traders shared the information obtained through these groups to help them work out their trading strategies. They then attempted to manipulate fix rates and trigger client “stop loss” orders (which are designed to limit the losses a client could face if exposed to adverse currency rate movements). This involved traders attempting to manipulate the relevant currency rate in the market, for example, to ensure that the rate at which the bank had agreed to sell a particular currency to its clients was higher than the average rate it had bought that currency for in the market. If successful, the bank would profit.
Firms can legitimately manage risk associated with client orders by trading in the market and may make a profit or loss as a result. It is completely unacceptable, however, for firms to engage in attempts at manipulation for their own benefit and to the potential detriment of certain clients and other market participants. Our Final Notices include examples where each Bank’s trading made a significant profit.
In setting the fine for each Bank we have considered, amongst other things: the Bank’s relevant revenue, the seriousness of the breach, each Bank’s disciplinary record and response to the wider issues around Libor, the degree of co-operation shown by each Bank, and knowledge and/or involvement of certain of those responsible for managing this part of the Bank’s business.
We have also increased the penalty to reflect specifically the seriousness of the risks posed to a systemically important market and the failure across the industry to learn the necessary lessons about tackling these risks, given the similar failings which arose in the context of Libor.
The Banks agreed to settle at an early stage and therefore qualified for a 30% discount under the FCA’s settlement discount scheme. Without the discount the total fine would have amounted to £1,592,740,000 ($2.5 billion): Citibank N.A. £322,250,000 ($511 million), HSBC Bank Plc £309,090,000 ($490 million), JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. £317,380,000 ($503 million), The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc £310,000,000 ($492 million) and UBS AG £334,020,000 ($530 million).
Our investigation lasted 13 months, involved over 70 enforcement staff and unprecedented cooperation with domestic and international regulators. We welcome the Serious Fraud Office’s criminal investigation into individuals.
Tackling the root causes
It is clear from our findings that there has been widespread poor practice in the spot FX market. The FCA has sought to take swift enforcement action against the worst offenders, and has today announced it will carry out an industry-wide supervisory remediation programme for firms to drive up standards across the market.
The FCA is already conducting broader reviews of how effectively firms reduce the risk of traders manipulating benchmarks and ensure confidential information is not abused, and will also look at how firms manage conflicts of interest. We will use our findings to inform the remediation programme as appropriate.
The remediation programme will require firms to review their systems and controls and policies and procedures in relation to their spot FX business to ensure that they are of a sufficiently high standard to effectively manage the risks faced by the business. The work at each firm will depend on a number of factors, for example, the size of the firm and its market share and impact, the remedial work already undertaken, and the role the firm plays in the market.
In some cases, the reviews will extend beyond G10 spot FX, and we will require firms to explore any read across into FX Emerging Markets, FX Sales, derivatives and structured products referencing FX rates and precious metals.
Senior management will be asked to attest that action has been taken and that firms’ systems and controls are adequate to manage these risks. This will ensure that there is clear accountability and senior management focus on the specific issues at each firm where the FCA expects to see change.  
The FCA has played a key role in developing internationally agreed regulatory standards on benchmarks including work by the International Organisation of Securities Regulators (IOSCO) and Financial Stability Board.  We are actively engaged in developing EU regulation on benchmarks and co-chair the UK Fair and Effective Markets Review which is considering wider reforms to the fixed income, commodity and currency markets.

Jharkhand polls: JMM to release manifesto againPrint
By: Express News Service | Ranchi | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:59 pm
The JMM will release a new manifesto for the Jharkhand Assembly elections, reportedly after the one released on Monday was riddled with errors.
The manifesto released by Shibu Soren on Monday was surprisingly brief and had a number of grammatical as well as spelling errors. It contained only a page on the achievements of the outgoing government under Hemant Soren.
The manifesto even failed to mention the party’s stand on the domicile policy, something that has been at the core of what the JMM stand for. General Secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the new manifesto would be released on Wednesday. “We were missing a page… It was not because we made mistakes,” he said. When asked about the absence of domicile policy, Bhattacharya said the new manifesto would correct that mistake: “The missing page was about the domicile policy.”

FTIL s minority shareholders oppose merger with NSELMinority shareholders of Financial Technologies oppose merger with NSEL
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 17:03 IST
Some minority shareholders of Financial Technologies (FTIL) have raised objections to the proposed merger of scam-hit National Spot Exchange (NSEL) with the company.
To ensure faster recovery of dues for entities hit by the Rs 5,600-crore fraud at NSEL, the government had last month ordered the merger of the bourse with its parent firm FTIL.
This is also the first time that the Corporate Affairs Ministry ordered a forced merger of private entities using a provision in the Companies Act that allows the government to intervene for essential public interest.
Sources said the ministry has received objections from some minority shareholders on the proposed amalgamation. Specific details were not immediately available.
The payment crisis at NSEL came to light in July 2013 and the decision to merge it with FTIL has been taken as the bourse is not left with any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of dues.
The proposal would have a final shape after taking into account submissions or objections made by the shareholders and creditors of the two companies. Comments have been sought from them till December 20.
NSEL's entire business, properties and liabilities, among others, would be transferred to FTIL after the merger, according to the draft order issued on October 21.
According to it, FTIL has not furnished any explanation as to what steps have been taken by NSEL or by FTIL itself as a parent company to honour the commitment of assuring safety and risk-free trading to the members and clients of the exchange. "NSEL does not have the resources, financial or human, or the organisational capability to successfully recover the dues pending for over a year," the draft order had said.
On the rationale of merger, it had said the government is of the considered opinion that the leverage combined assets, capital and reserves for efficient administration and satisfactory settlement of rights and liabilities of stakeholders and creditors of NSEL would be in essential public interest.
The Ministry had also said that FTIL cannot be allowed to confine its responsibility and concern only for the small investors alone and it has to shoulder full responsibility for the outstanding dues at NSEL.

defend himself against suggestionsEU to press Luxembourg over tax breaks amid fresh allegations
Ex-Luxembourg PM Jean-Claude Juncker is facing a tough first week as EU Commission president
The European Commission is to press Luxembourg over new allegations it offered tax breaks for more than 300 global companies, an EU spokesman says.
But Commission chief and ex-Luxembourg PM Jean-Claude Juncker will not handle the probe, Margaritis Schinas said.
Pepsi and Ikea are among those accused of making deals with Luxembourg to save billions in tax in other countries.
The revelations were published in a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
Luxembourg is already under investigation by the EU over suspected "sweetheart" tax deals with online retailer Amazon and the financing arm of carmaker Fiat.
Two other member states, Ireland and Malta, are also being investigated as part of the EU's crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes.
Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel has insisted that the deals abided by international rules on tax, in comments reported by AFP news agency.
Analysis: Theo Leggett, business correspondent
The suggestion that multinational companies channel profits through Luxembourg-based subsidiaries in order to minimise their tax bills is hardly new.
What this research appears to show - with the help of thousands of pages of leaked documents - is just how widespread the practice has been, and the extent to which it has effectively been endorsed by the Luxembourg authorities.
The important point is that these arrangements are not in any way illegal as far as the companies themselves are concerned - in fact many of the leaked documents are so-called "comfort letters" from the Luxembourg authorities specifically endorsing individual schemes.
However, the findings are likely to be politically sensitive.
It could all make life rather uncomfortable for the new European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker - a former prime minister of Luxembourg, on whose watch many of these deals were done
'Less than 1% tax'
The ICIJ said a team of 80 journalists had pored over nearly 28,000 pages of leaked documents showing tax agreements and returns relating to more than 1,000 businesses.
It says the companies created "complicated accounting and legal structures that move profits to low-tax Luxembourg from higher-tax countries where they're headquartered or do lots of business".
Mr Juncker has asked EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager to lead the investigation
In some cases, it adds, companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1% on profits moved into the European duchy.
"The Duchy of Luxembourg has a legitimate government that has to provide answers to the investigation opened by the Commission," the EU Commission's spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters on Thursday.
When pressed repeatedly about Mr Juncker's role in the probe, Mr Schinas said that EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager would take charge of the current investigation.
"She will request the appropriate information, enforcing the rules, as is the duty of the European Commission," he added.
The leaked papers related to some 340 companies, including FedEx, Accenture, Burberry, Procter & Gamble, Heinz, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank.
The deals - which the ICIJ says were legal - were facilitated by the international tax advisory group PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The Guardian, which was one of the media outlets working on the probe, said it painted "a damning picture of an EU state which is quietly rubber-stamping tax avoidance on an industrial scale".
Luxembourg was "like a magical fairyland," the paper quotes former senior US Treasury official Stephen Shay as saying.

Diagnosing glaucoma by watching your iPad It could be here sooner than you think.By Peter Holley November 12 Follow @peterjholley

Imagine being able to determine whether you have a degenerative eye disease such as glaucoma by simply watching a movie or TV show on your iPad. If it sounds too good to be true, that's because it is. For now.
But a new study from researchers in the United Kingdom suggests that, thanks to advances in eye-tracking software, identifying one of world's leading causes of blindness could someday be as simple as watching a sitcom in your home.
By comparing a group of 32 elderly people with healthy vision to 44 patients with a clinical diagnosis of glaucoma, researchers found that they were able to identify glaucoma by interpreting maps of people's eye movements while they watched a TV show or a movie. The study — "What's on TV? Detecting age-related neurodegenerative eye disease using eye movement scanpaths"— appears in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience , an open-access academic publisher and research network.
"Your eye movements are one of the fastest movements that your body makes," said David Crabb, the study's lead author and a professor at City University of London. "By tracking eye movements for just a few minutes, we end up with a picture that looks like a bunch of dots connected by lines. And within that picture, we've been able to find a signature, a fingerprint really, for how someone uses their eyes."
What sort of programming did subjects watch? The 2006 British film "History Boys" and "Dad's Army," a popular BBC sitcom from the 1970s, Crabb said.
Glaucoma is not curable, and vision lost cannot be regained, but medication and surgery can halt further vision loss, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation.
As it turns out, Crabb explained, people with glaucoma use their eyes differently than people with healthy vision, often in a way that compensates for vision and effects their peripheral vision first. It's these subtle compensatory movements, unraveled using computer models, that allow researchers to determine whether someone is suffering from a disease like glaucoma.
Both of the groups studied also underwent standard vision examinations, and disease severity was measured for the group with clinical glaucoma diagnoses, according to researchers.
"You get thousands of these data points after only a few minutes," Crabb said, "and if you look at those points with the human eye it looks like a huge mess."

Researchers suspected there might be patterns in the "mess," but they couldn't be sure until computer programs normally used in biomathematics allowed them to "untangle the patterns in the scramble."
"It was quite thrilling," Crabb noted.
Glaucoma is irreversible, and what makes it particularly dangerous, according to the study, is that vision loss can occur subtly at first. As the disease worsens, the eye's ability to compensate erodes, leading to noticeable sight loss and, in some cases, blindness. Crabb said tracking people's eye movements by having them watch a film could improve early detection and monitoring of glaucoma; he noted that patients frequently complain about having to go into a clinic for periodic testing.
The Glaucoma Research Foundation estimates that more than 2.2 million Americans have glaucoma, but only about half know they have the condition.
"Technology that identifies where someone is looking has improved dramatically in the last five years," Crabb said. "This technology is very much being driven by people developing phones and tablets, and we think it's going to be more affordable and accurate over time, and you might be able to do your eye testing at home at some point."
The study was funded by the U.K. charity Fight for Sight.

Retail inflation slips to 5.52 per cent in OctoberRetail inflation slips further to 5.52 per cent in October
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 20:02 IST
Consumer food price inflation eased to 5.59 per cent in October (Photo: Reuters)
Helped by softening prices of food items, the retail inflation declined to 5.52 per cent in October, the lowest since the new series of data was introduced in January 2012.
This is the fourth consecutive month of decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation or retail inflation which had fallen to 6.46 per cent in the previous month.
The overall food inflation measured on CPI came down to 5.59 per cent in October as against 7.67 per cent in the previous month.
Retail prices of vegetables declined by 1.45 per cent as against a rise of 8.59 per cent in September, according the the data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
Inflation in fruits slowed to 17.49 per cent from 22.4 per cent in September. Similarly the rate of price rise in protein rich items like eggs, fish and meat was at 6.34 per cent in October, slightly down from 6.35 per cent in the previous month.
The data on inflation based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for October will be released on Friday. WPI inflation had dropped to a near five-year low in September to 2.38 per cent, helped by moderation in food and fuel prices.
The Reserve Bank of India has of late started targeting retail inflation, while deciding on its bi-monthly monetary policy.
RBI has been targeting a retail inflation of 8 per cent by March 2015 and 6 per cent by March 2016.
RBI's next monetary policy is due on December 2, 2014.

The Google Doodle might be a momentary piece of art that brightens up your morning, but there is a lot of work that goes into creating these. In fact, the Google Doodle team is already working on the calendar of doodles for 2015.
“We get recommendations from Googlers across the world about what they think should be rendered as a doodle. We finally come up with a shortlist,” says Kristopher Hom, the Software Engineer who has been animating doodles for over five years. “Often we have two recommendations for a day. In such cases, we hold one of them for the next years,” says Hom, who started out in the search team, but soon started  working on animations and interaction to Google Doodles.
While he sees Doodles as a unique opportunity to showcase emerging browser technologies to the world, he remembers the time when he has to ask users for algorithms that could break the Google logo into as few dots as possible. “The browsers those days were not that good. Finally, someone came up with a suggestion that showed the logo in just 64 dots,” he says.
Hom likes doodles that help us remembers scientists who were not that famous but lets a big impact on our lives with their discoveries. His favourite doodle, however, is the 2012 Indian independence day doodle created by his friends.
The first Google Doodle in 1998, was just Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s way of indicating that they would be attending the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. The next doodle appeared in 2000 to mark Bastille Day and since then hundreds of Google have made the world smile, and think, before they clicked the search button.
While animating doodles, Hom says, he tries to make it as simple as possible. “My grandmother should be able to play and enjoy the doodle. That is very important,” says Hom, who is the first member of the Doodle team to visit India. With Google now putting multiple doodles across different countries on the same day, Hom says the team of around 20 illustrators and engineers end up making close to one doodle a day now. The team is open to suggestions sent on proposals@google.com and receives hundreds of requests every day.
Hom was in India to announce the winner of the 2014 Doodle4Google contest, which was won by Vaidehi Reddy of Pune . She won the contest, themed ‘A place in India I wish to visit’, with a doodle on Assam.

Sena slams BJP over NCP support  likens Pawars party tomousePrint
Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' said that NCP 'nibbled the state coffers like a mouse'.
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:48 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 5:50 pm
Though Maharashtra government led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has won the trust vote in the Assembly but before the House went for voting, the opposition Shiv Sena slammed the BJP government and warned its former ally that it will be disrespecting people’s mandate if it takes support of NCP which “nibbled the state coffers like a mouse”.
“(Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra) Fadnavis once said that he wants to run the government for the people. But how do you plan to run the government taking support of a party that has been discarded by the people of the state?
“Will you win the trust vote taking support of a party which has nibbled at the state coffers like a mouse? Will you take support of a mouse?”, the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
Taunting its former ally, the party said the BJP is ready to take Sena’s support to save face during the trust vote, but is unrelenting on carrying forward talks regarding Sena’s role in the state government.
“BJP asks us to give it support on the basis of similar ideologies and principles. You (BJP) also know that the ideology of NCP is only to loot Maharashtra,” it alleged.
“But you (BJP) have nothing to do with that? You are ready to take their unconditional support,” the Sena said while asking the BJP “on whose tunes it plans to dance now”.
It is a strange scenario where the party with largest mandate is joining hands with a party that fared badly during the recent Assembly elections, the Sena said.
“Why was the NCP thrown to the fourth position this time? What kind of principles does the BJP talk about when it agrees to take support of a party which was relegated to the fourth position by the people,” it said.
“Saving the government is the only priority of BJP, for which it will also take support of the MIM which is working towards vitiating the minds of people,” the Sena alleged.

Maharashtra: Sena  Congress demand fresh floor test after BJP s controversial winThe BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra won a crucial confidence motion on Wednesday through a voice vote that the Shiv Sena described as “strangling democracy” and the Congress called “a black day”.
 
The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member assembly, passed the test to prove its majority through a simple “Aye” from legislators supporting the 13-day-old minority government, though their voice got muffled in the din raised by the Shiv Sena and the Congress.
 
Speaker Haribhau Bagde suspended five Congress legislators for two years after they allegedly heckled governor C Vidyasagar Rao who was injured in the melee as protests inside and outside the assembly turned ugly.
 
The BJP government needed to prove its majority because it was 22 short of the halfway mark in the assembly. Having snapped its 25-year alliance with the Shiv Sena, it didn’t have the 63 MLAs of its former ally to bail it out.
 
Bagde, who was elected unopposed earlier in the day, called the voice vote valid and rejected the opposition’s demand for a poll.
 
“The house should be run as per rules and the Constitution should not be trampled upon. The new government is strangling democracy. We sought division but the trust motion was passed by voice vote,” said opposition leader Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena.
 
The Congress questioned the legitimacy of the trust vote and said it would approach the governor with the request to ask the Fadnavis government to prove its majority by a poll.
 
“This is the darkest day in the history of the Maharashtra assembly. We will not allow the house to function under this minority government,” said former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan.
 
Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam said the BJP government’s act was against the spirit of the Constitution and threatened to take legal recourse. “Vidhan Sabha stands tarnished today. A division would have made it clear whether they have the support of the majority of MLAs. The confidence motion has not been passed.”
 
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Bagde rubbished the opposition’s claims, saying due process was followed.
 
"Congress and Shiv Sena did not ask for a poll (division of votes) at the appropriate time. Since Congress has always been in power it has forgotten the rules about when to ask for division of votes,” Fadnavis told reporters
 
All this while MLAs of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which had committed its support to the Fadnavis government, sat quietly and watched the opposition demand a division. The division of votes, which according to convention is held with legislators voting for or against a motion, was ruled out by the Speaker.
 
The BJP had said it had direct and indirect support of 140 MLAs but needed some legislators to vote for it or abstain in the event of a poll.
 
Since there was no clarity on which way the NCP voted, the speaker’s move was seen as an attempt to save the BJP the embarrassment of publicly going along with Sharad Pawar’s party that has 41 MLAs, sources said.
 
Despite the day’s developments, the BJP indicated in the evening that it was still open to an alliance with the Sena. Fadnavis told HT that he has plans to expand his cabinet before the winter session of the legislature begins in Nagpur on December 8.

Unless productivity were finally to improveAre Scotland's new tax and spending powers fair?
For the first time in five years, pay excluding bonuses - so-called "regular" earnings - is rising faster than inflation.
Here is your statutory wealth warning: the rise in real pay has been for one month only (so far) and is so small as to create an almost imperceptible bulge in your wallet; pay rose by 1.3%, versus CPI inflation of 1.2%.
That said, the average pay rise in the private sector - where most people work, and where all the growth in employment is happening - was a bit better, at 1.6%.
But if none of that gets your pulses racing, the governor of the Bank of England thinks - at long last, you might say - that it won't be long before you are feel properly better off.
That said, he resisted my invitation to declare that the longest squeeze in British living standards in recorded history is now over.
Here are the Bank's encouraging forecasts.
In spite of serious weakness in the economies that buy from British businesses, especially the eurozone, the Bank expects growth in national income will slow only modestly in 2015 to 2.9% - compared with 3.5% this year.
More relevantly to most of us, it expects average weekly earnings will rise 3.25% next year and 3.75% the following year - compared with just 1.25% for the whole of 2014.
If that takes place, there should be a perceptible improvement in our sense of how well off we are - because the Bank expects that inflation will fall from 1.2% during the last three months of this year, to 1% in the first half of next year.
That improvement in our sense of well being won't be immense however: the Bank forecasts a rise of 1.25% in real post-tax household income next year and 2.5% the year after.
Falling inflation is probably a good thing, for now, so long as it does not turn into pernicious deflation, of the kind that deters us all from spending (it is human nature to defer purchases if we think we can buy more cheaply later).
Which is why the governor did not look too stressed when he said that he expects he will find himself writing one of those mildly embarrassing letters to the chancellor in coming months, to explain why inflation is significantly (more than 1%) lower than the 2% target.
Indeed inflation is expected to return to that target only after three years - because of the powerful disinflationary impact of lacklustre global growth and falling commodity prices.
Here is a funny peculiar thing.
The UK's lamentable productivity performance, which the Bank of England expects to continue for some years, is for now a good thing.
Because if wages rise faster than output per hour, as forecast by the Bank, then that would help inflation return to target: inflationary wage rises would offset the other deflationary pressures.
But - and there is a big but - we can't afford to pay ourselves more than we earn forever. Unless productivity starts to accelerate at some point, we'll be mired in living-standards stagnation.
And the big unspoken risk to the British economy, as it becomes more dependent on domestic demand to sustain the momentum of growth, is that an already unsustainably large deficit on the current account continues to widen - as we suck in imports.
Unless productivity were finally to improve, to make our exporters more competitive, those who finance that deficit might lose patience. And we could witness a phenomenon that would engender the wrong kind of nostalgia in those of a certain age: an old-fashioned sterling crisis.

The Nartaka festival saw some riveting performances.
Normally, he thought, some amount of coaxing and cajoling would appease his miffed nayika and everything would be alright. But, it seemed not so this time. The things he says only makes her angrier. Has she grown wiser than to fall for his tactics?
Pattabhi Ramayya had put a pen to these thoughts when he wrote the javali ‘Taru Maru lade vemay’ from the point of view of the dhrishta nayaka who is guilty of hurting his beloved. The nayaka thinks he can console her, only to be given the cold shoulder. Recently, Bengaluru-based Bharatanatyam dancer Praveen Kumar presented this composition at the 8th Nartaka Festival conducted by Natyanjali Trust and portrayed the complex psyche of this nayaka through his abhinaya.
There is little doubt that Praveen is a fine dancer. Apart from the clean lines and sound footwork, it is the subtlety of expression that stood out in this recital. In the javali, especially, Praveen charmingly navigated the intricate emotions of guilt, anger, mirth and indistinct desperation. He managed to portray the nayaka’s ego, flirtations and finally, his resignation to fate. Praveen succeeded in striking a balance between externalising the nayaka’s thoughts and portraying his reactions as and when he is turned down by his nayika.
Praveen began the evening with a Ganapati vandana, ‘Gayiye Ganapati Jaga Vandana’ ( Kalavati, Adi). Here, he oscillated between the representation of the majestic elephant god and his humble devotee. In aspects of nritta, simple gestures like lifting and placing his feet, a near-perfect natyarambhe and his ability to traverse the space of the stage were a delight to watch. The concluding jati was fabulous.
The varnam in Nattakurinji, ‘Swami Naan Undan Adimai,’ was rendered well. The opening korvai showed Praveen’s grounding as a dancer and his training from his gurus Narmada and Prof. C.V. Chandrashekar. The varnam gave him the opportunity to showcase both nritta and abhinaya.
After the javali, Praveen brought in yet another innovation to the Devarnama ‘Maneyolagado Govinda’ where he portrayed vatsalya bhava from the point of view of the father instead of the mother. After being reprimanded by the neighbours, Krishna’s father coaxes his son to play inside and not create trouble in the neighbourhood. He tries to make the little boy stay inside the house by offering some freshly made butter and jewels. Praveen used subtle gestures to portray Krishna’s father. For instance, he ties the belt around little Krishna’s waist but it is too tight. He loosens it and the father-son duo have a good laugh about it. The father’s dilemma between showcasing his affection for his child and being stern – all at the same time came through in this composition.
Justin McCarthy
A student of Subbaraya Pillai, Justin McCarthy has strong foundations in the Pandanallur bani. He began with an alaripu that was crisp and neat. ‘Swamiyai Azhaithu’, the Khamas varnam that followed was shaky at first but was rendered well later, especially in the second half. In fact, McCarthy’s rendition of the varnam brought out the beauty of the raga. This was followed by ‘Paiyada Paimeda’, a padam in Nadanamakriya, which was mostly performed seated. A treatise on abhinaya, this piece was a testament to the years of training that has gone behind shaping McCarthy as an artist. He then performed ‘Vagaladi’, a javali in Behag and concluded his recital with a thillana in Mandari. It was the thillana that brought out the finest in McCarthy’s dancing: the ease with which he performed the ushi adavu and the neat footwork.
McCarthy was accompanied by a talented ensemble of artists. Sudha Raghuraman on the vocals was exceptional. The opening alapana of Khamas, her version of Nadanamakriya and finally the Behag were all individually fascinating. G. Raghuraman on the flute was equally enterprising. R. Sriganesh on the mridangam and Lokesh Bharadwaj on the nattuvangam were both enchanting.
Prof. C.V. Chandrashekar
His dance has always been a testament to the meritable tutelage he has received and his ability to translate that training into his recitals. However, on the final day of the Nartaka festival, when Prof. C.V. Chandrashekar danced, apart from his training, it was the performer in him that predominated. His ability as a dancer to guide the ensemble accompanying him, his stage presence, stamina and finally, his versatility held the audience’s attention till the very end.
Almost at the end of every kita thaka dhari kita thom, the audience was compelled to put their hands together to salute CVC’s dancing. K. Hariprasad began the recital with a reverberating version of ‘Mahaganapatim.’
CVC began with ‘Sri Ganapatini Sevimparare’ in Saurashtram which was a simple, yet fascinating invocation. This was followed by ‘Nadanai Azhaithu vaa sakhiye’, a varnam in Khambodi. Persistent requests to the sakhi and the subsequent anticipation were beautifully rendered in his abhinaya. The second half of the varnam was equally, if not more, engaging with the veteran striking a fine balance between nritta and abhinaya. At one point, Jaya Chandrashekhar, who was on the nattuvangam, faltered a bit. CVC repeated the jati vocalising the sollu kattu and making it right. The varnam was his statement as a performer.
He concluded the recital with excerpts from Kumara Gurupara in which he portrayed Karthikeya’s pranks as a child. Rendered both from the point of view of the child as well as his parents, this was an abhinaya-centric piece. In terms of just the music too, this ragamalika was charming.
Praising the child’s ornaments, the sound of his bells, his tiresome pranks and ultimately the genius of divinity were all translated into refined expressions.

Bishwanath Ghosh’s third book Longing Belonging mirrors his impression and experience of Calcutta
Bishwanath Ghosh’s story of Calcutta was born over a plate of kebabs and beer in the seedy insides of Trincas, the age-old, landmark restaurant on Park Street, Kolkata. A lady in a black dress crooned hits from a bygone time on stage, while Ghosh’s companions ballparked her age — anywhere between 25 and twice that — veiled in uncertainty by the bar’s dim lighting. The debate died a quiet death soon enough, settling by the fact that she must be old, for she’d been singing there “since a long time ago”. That phrase, “a long time ago”, came to define Ghosh’s conversations with Calcutta’s people and places that have been around for so long that time was no longer measured in dates and years, but in “nuggets of memory”.
The exploration of these markers of time make Ghosh’s third book Longing Belonging, which was launched this weekend in the city at a Madras Book Club event convened by theatre personality P.C. Ramakrishna. Born to Bengali parents but brought up in Kanpur, Calcutta to Ghosh, was the city of merely work and family commitments till 2006, when he married a woman from Calcutta. The city he calls “hometown-in-law” soon became the place that “smelt of his childhood”, where the local language was “no longer just background sound, but my mother tongue”. “Every phrase, every sentence and every page of this book expresses that longing to belong, poignantly, in pithy, active prose,” says Ramakrishna, “It says, ‘I wish I was here growing up’.”
The Calcutta Ghosh discovers is a city of paradoxes, “a sturdy, grime-coated grandfather’s clock, whose pendulum swings between extremities”. And unlike other cities, resolute in their march to modernity, Ghosh says Calcutta never wipes the old out for the new, merely makes space for it to coincide. This “endorsement of contrast”, he observes for instance at Kalighat, where a famous Kali temple, Mother Teresa home for the dying, a stretch of soliciting prostitutes and Mamata Banerjee’s home all line up in the peaceful presence of each other. In another instance, at Ghosh’s visit to Sonagachhi, reputed to be Asia’s largest red-light district, he finds the tomb of Sona Ghazi, an Iraqi saint who’d visited over 800 years ago. As the trickle of pilgrims swells through the day, the tomb’s caretaker watches over their comings and goings, musing that more would visit if the tomb wasn’t so close to the sex workers’ hub. “But what to do,” he asks in empathy, “they (the sex workers) have got to eat too, no?”
For all of Calcutta’s public, popular-culture portrayal as a city of squalor and decay, and for all of Bengalis’ own love for nostalgia, it is a city undeniably modern too, says Ghosh. He cites the example of Salt Lake City, the swanking, new suburb of Calcutta, with its highrises and thriving businesses, which most staunch Bengalis often don’t acknowledge as the city’s own. What the city has experienced, though, in this bargain for quick progress, are incidents such as Nandigram and Singur that not only led to a toppling of the once time-tested Left governance but also symbolise what Ghosh calls “an erosion of grace”. “The city once known for its innate civility, has, two refugee influxes later, become a city of problems.” Alongside tracking this trajectory of change, Ghosh also traces a “cultural erosion”, where Calcutta’s deep-rooted traditional celebration of literature, theatre, music and art have given way to a thriving of Bengali saas-bahu serials. “Thinking is still serious business in Bengal. The adda flourishes like never before, but there has not been an icon from Calcutta since Satyajit Ray. Rituparno Ghosh or Saurav Ganguly come close, but that’s about it.”
This observation, of course, opens up discussions of Calcutta’s rise and fall of Marxist strongholds, its likenesses to France’s ‘air of permissiveness’, and leads to questions from the audience about the city’s modest cost of living, the safety of its women, and its similarities with Kerala, down to Ramakrishna’s observation of both cultures juxtaposing vowels in their accents. The evening closed with an audience member singing lines from Dhono Dhanne Pushpe Bhora, a song that equals a mother’s love to a country’s own. Seated in Chennai, discussing Calcutta, that moment of music mirrored Ghosh’s own experience of Calcutta, a ‘probashi Bangali’ (non-resident Bengali) still finding home there, from a distance. Longing Belonging – An Outsider at Home in Calcutta (Tranquebar) is priced at Rs. 350 and is now available in stores and online.

Padma Vibhushan awardee K.G.Subramanyan talked about approaches to books and art at DakshinaChitra
This year, versatile arts practitioner and Padma Vibhushan awardee K.G. Subramanyan turned 90. The Governor of Tamil Nadu K. Rosaiah inaugurated his travelling show of 90 new works with Seagull Foundation for the Arts at Lalit Kala Akademi on November 4. At DakshinaChitra, Mani Da, as the community fondly calls him, interacted with an audience. With eloquence and acumen, he churned out pieces of wisdom from vast stores of human experience that oft remain hidden. In graphic black and white illustrations, collaged together with text, the original artworks of his 1998 book, The Tale of the Talking Face, are presented at the Varija Gallery. Relating to the 1970s Emergency, this is an allegorical tale about a princess who uses her powers to clamp down on democracy. A verse reads:
And, besides, pictures cannot be prophets
So she covered it with a mirror
Where she could see her own beaming face
Can this be a children’s book? “When you talk about doing books for children, it poses certain problems — what kind of themes?” The appropriateness of what children should be reading comes up — whether epics are too violent or unfavourable to the learning we try to inculcate in the young. Mani Da exhorts, “You cannot escape this world. You cannot protect the child from everything. If you do, the child will become more vulnerable.” And so, his books are not made to be children’s literature, yet their parable-like quality makes them universally accessible.
Teaching at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda in the 1960s, Subramanyan found art students were not clear about many concepts. “What is abstraction? What is distortion? In attempting to answer these questions, I was teaching myself! It is the same thing with books and children. There is always a child in you that you want to talk to. The audience should be within yourself.”
Prolific with his expression and working across many media, and his two worlds Baroda and Santiniketan, Subramanyan’s books spark from social events, political upheavals and the smallest of things. After a gall bladder surgery when his surgeon extrapolated about the millions of microbes inside the body, Subramanyan imagined a “metropolis of microbes” and wrote a poem. Once in Ahmedabad at Haku Shah’s residence, while they were sitting in the veranda, a camel walked by on the street. Immediately, he noticed that Shah’s tall younger son started to imitate the camel’s extended gait. “I realised that, in the world, we are all imitating someone or something.” The book, he eventually produced, let children imagine how they could be like animals. Known for his wit, satire and engagement with social commentary, Subramanyan collages images. “I owe my early illustrations to Nandalal Bose.” Then, pointing his other influence to Bengal’s much-loved filmmaker, he says, “Satyajit Ray discovered the essence of Bengali landscape.” In books, illustrations should not be literal; instead, touch on something different from words, exploring another layer altogether.
Studying Economics at Presidency College, Madras, before choosing the arts, Subramanyan was articulate and questioned everything considerably, sometimes ruffling his teachers at Santiniketan. Determined to excel, he was drawing page after page earnestly when Nandalal Bose came up to him. “You’ve worked hard. But it’s like a kind of laundry list!” When you put in too much detail, the character gets lost, says Mani Da. And then Nandalal Bose handed him a chalk replacing the pen he was working with: what he drew then was completely different. “This difference comes from the primary experience — chalk and pen. Most art schools today do not inculcate primary experience. We know more about the African Safari than what is happening in front of us!”
In 1969, Abdul Ghaffar Khan was coming to India after a long absence for Gandhiji’s centenary. Political parties wanted to spoil the atmosphere and instigated communal riots in Ahmedabad. K. G. Subramanyan responded with his first book — When God First Made the Animals He Made Them All Alike, a narrative with animal characters. “Different costumes and different ways of acting — that difference became deadly to you.” “Who is an artist?” asks Mani Da and continues, “He is a special kind of person who finds sheer joy in living.” Drawing from Gandhiji’s path to win the hearts of all, even those against you, Mani Da says forcefully trying to better the world will go nowhere, instead, “If you love the world, you will make the world better. Plan for a way so that the world can change itself.”

McDonald s Drops Iconic Jinglereddit
It's likely more symbolic than significant, but 43 years after the slogan was written for McDonald's first national TV campaign, putting the brand on the map, McDonald's Corp. has abandoned its trademark for "You deserve a break today." Ad Age rated it the top advertising jingle of the 20th Century. Now it can be yours.
Keith Reinhard, the legendary ad man who created "You deserve a break today" in 1970, recently recalled that a McDonald's exec asked how long he thought the campaign would last. "I said, 'You should stop running this campaign when people no longer deserve a break,'" Reinhard, now chairman emeritus of DDB Needham, told Advertising Age .
Reinhard was a creative director at Chicago agency Needham, Harper & Steers in 1970 when it was among the agencies invited to pitch McDonald's national ad account, which was valued then at an impressive $35 million. Last year it reportedly spent $1.43 billion on U.S. advertising, with DDB Needham still its lead U.S. agency.
If you think that "You deserve a break today" is a bit corny, realize that a McDonald's executive raised that same objection when the line was pitched. He was overruled. "[McDonald's Corp. Founder and Chairman] Ray Kroc said in his high-pitched voice, 'Nothing wrong with a little corn!'" Reinhard recalled him saying. "And I knew we were in good shape."
Reinhard-whose book Any Wednesday was published earlier this year-has said that part of the power of the line he wrote was that "You deserve..." granted consumers permission to indulge in a fast-food meal at McDonald's. And the lyrics were particularly appealing to Kroc, who was a stickler about cleanliness:
Grab a bucket and mop,
Scrub the bottom and top.
There is nothing so clean
As my burger machine!
With a broom and a brush
Clean it up for the rush
Before you open the door,
Put a shine on the floor!
When we've finished, what then?"
Start all over again!
Tell me, what does it mean?
At McDonald's it's clean!
You deserve a break today!
So get up and get away!
To McDonald's! McDonald's! McDonald's!
"You deserve a break today" was first used in 1971 in a TV commercial that featured actor John Amos--later the father on Good Times, the adult Kunta Kinte in Roots and other roles--dancing with a bucket and mop. Sidney Woloshin composed the music for the jingle (despite frequent erroneous reports that Barry Manilow wrote the words and/or music), a credit that was the lead to Woloshin's obituary in 2000.
"You deserve a break today" was revived for ads in 1981 and 1982 after Chicago's Leo Burnett replaced DDB Needham as lead agency. In 1995, Burnett tweaked it as "Have you had your break today?" and that was the line's last hurrah.
In July 1997, McDonald's sales were struggling. Ed Rensi stepped down as president of McDonald's USA. And the McDonald's account, then $400 million, was returned to DDB Needham.
Several years ago, McDonald's abandoned its trademark claims to "We do it all for you," one of the many memorable ad slogans it has used over the years. But "You deserve a break today" was the first real tagline, the iconic one and the one that many people still can hum.
McDonald's again finds itself struggling to ensure its relevance. Sales are down again. Mike Andres was named president of McDonald's USA in August, succeeding Jeff Stratton, who stepped down. "You deserve a break today" wouldn't necessarily put the brand back on the tracks now, but it's probably worth remembering that what first made the brand relevant was its slogan's commitment to simple, clean operations and to being a tasty reward for everyday living.

New apps meet need for more privacy after over-sharing0
"Millennials are realizing that they have to be really careful about what they share on public social networks. One embarrassing or exposing photo can severely impact their job prospects," said Greg Isenberg, CEO of 5by, a division of San Francisco-based web discovery engine StumbleUpon.
The 5by app, for iPhone, iPad and Android devices, allows users to create private forums around videos. They can search for videos across public social networks like YouTube and Vimeo and share them with a select group of people.
"For young people it's about sending that silly video and expressing yourself how you really want to express yourself," said Isenberg.
Ephemeral media apps such as Snapchat, which disappear after a few seconds, cater to consumers' desire for more private experiences, he said.
Snapchat, available for iPhone and Android, makes texts, photos and videos disappear seconds after they are viewed.
"You know it won't live beyond a certain time so you express yourself in a truer manner to yourself," said Isenberg.
Facebook has also recognized the need for more private experiences. Last month it launched the Rooms iPhone app to allow users to converse with a select group of people using real, or made up, names.
The company earlier this year acquired private social messaging app WhatsApp, which lets people chat privately with friends across mobile devices.
Flurry Chief Executive Officer Simon Khalaf said consumers realize they need to restrict how they share information. Users might share a silly photo with a friend on Snapchat, he said, but share a photo family members might see on Facebook.
"Often times with new technology, such as in the early days with Facebook and social web-based platforms, we over-shared," said Marcos Sanchez, vice president of corporate communications at San Francisco-based mobile analytics firm App Annie.
"As we go through these phases of oversharing, it's often followed by a phase of curation."

United Airlines intends to supersize its rides at O'Hare and create multiple rush hours during the day — moves it says will benefit passengers and make the airline more money at the same time.
The transition to flying fewer but larger aircraft out of Chicago's biggest airport, a strategy called upgauging, has already begun. Meanwhile, changing United's flight schedule to group departures during the day, called rebanking, will begin in earnest with March flights.
"We think it's good for everybody involved," said Brian Znotins, United vice president of network. "Rebanking and upgauging really go hand in hand."
For United's customers, there are pros and cons to the moves, which are emerging trends not only for United but also for American Airlines at O'Hare and other airlines nationwide.
Chicago O'Hare is the worst airport in America for winter travelers who want to be on time and avoid crowds, according to a new report released Tuesday. ( Gregory Karp )
While the changes are largely behind the scenes, they could affect everything from fares, flight choices and connections to airport crowds, on-time departures and congestion on the tarmac and in the airspace over Chicago.
Perhaps the most obvious benefit for Chicago passengers will be flying newer, larger aircraft. And for fliers connecting at O'Hare, it means shorter connections and less downtime between flights. For Chicago-based United, the changes could mean higher revenue and lower costs, although officials declined to quantify what the changes at O'Hare would mean for the airline's bottom line.

The greatest peril for United might be its on-time departure rate, as the airline crams flights into tighter time windows at O'Hare, which in recent months has had the worst on-time departure rates in the country among large airports. During some months, one-third of flights leave late, on average. United itself already has mediocre on-time rates compared with competitors, ranking seventh over the past year among 12 airlines that report to the U.S. Department of Transportation, according to the most recent report.
"I hope this does not lead to unforeseen delays, especially in light of American's decision to also tighten its O'Hare hub banks," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. He said he is concerned about a "potential increase in congestion on United's tarmacs, and the taxiways and runways its aircraft use during peak hub periods."
Znotins contends cutting the number of planes United flies out of O'Hare more than compensates for scheduling flights closer to one another. "I think this actually helps our on-time performance," he said.
With the moves, United will be adding to its service overall at O'Hare, unusual in an era when carriers are trying to hold the line on additional capacity. While the number of United departures at O'Hare will drop up to 8 percent next year, larger planes will carry up to 10 percent more seats during some months, according to Jim Compton, United's chief revenue officer.
More seats flying out of O'Hare "may translate into better access to some of United's less expensive fares as well as the potential of additional fare promotions, depending on market conditions," Harteveldt said.
However, Znotins said that the changes were not about fares.
"There's no way to make any assumptions about fares," he said. "It's about building better and more appealing connections for our passengers and offering a better product."
United's acquisition of newer, larger 76-seat Embraer 175 jets will mean the airline, via its United Express partners, can replace 10 or 11 of its older, fuel-inefficient 50-seaters with about seven new ones.
"For each 50-seat aircraft an E175 is replacing, we expect to generate over $1 million of annual improved profitability," Compton said in an earnings call last month.
cComments
No, I read the same article and I stand by my observations. They are factual. And I don't care if article used large, larger or largest....it's misleading. The 175 is a knock-off or miniature Airbus 119 which is a small airliner, smaller than most 737s flying. I actually enjoy the...

United already flies 18 E175s nationwide, 12 of which are from O'Hare. By next summer, the airline will be using about 50 across its network, Znotins said.
For passengers, that means wider seats, wider aisles, bigger overhead bins, onboard Wi-Fi and inclusion of a first-class cabin and improved first-class food. The new planes beat the old ones in customer satisfaction, Znotins said.
In addition, United will be using more narrow-body mainline aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 that holds in the neighborhood of 150 passengers.
If upgauging is such a great idea, why didn't United move to larger planes earlier?
The airline couldn't use such planes because of restrictions in its agreement with the pilots union, restrictions that were loosened when it sealed a new deal with pilots after its merger with Continental. After that, it took time to get the new planes.
"Planes don't show up right away. We've just starting to induct them into the fleet over the course of the last few months," Znotins said.
For United, fewer departures means lower costs, cutting labor and fuel expenses. Again, Znotins declined to place a dollar figure on the cost savings of upgauging.
Znotins said fewer planes could help United's flights be on time more often during the winter with fewer planes to de-ice, for example. Meanwhile, fewer aircraft also could help ease congestion in the airspace around O'Hare.
United today runs 14 loosely defined banks of flights at O'Hare, but somewhat spread out through the day. With rebanking, it has taken those flights and consolidated them into 11 banks that are directional, with morning flights arriving from the east, reloading at O'Hare and heading to a destination farther west. Then the route will reverse.
"That will repeat throughout the day," Znotins said. "When we talk about repeaking Chicago ... we're concentrating those banks so that connecting passengers have better connections."
For example, it might mean more one-hour layovers but fewer that last three hours.
Shorter connecting times could create a competitive advantage and an opportunity to charge more for a shorter flight. Compton told stock analysts last month the move "drives efficiency-related (profit) margin improvement."
United's flight peaking in March — along with American Airlines' same move — is likely to affect O'Hare Airport itself.
United will create peak periods, every hour to 90 minutes, meaning its gates during the day will be either bustling or desolate.
"Basically, you wipe the gate slate clean," Znotins said. "It's like starting a new day every 90 minutes."
Grouped flights can create problems at the airport, with periods of jammed TSA security lines and hordes of passengers waiting at departure gates, not to mention longer lines at restaurants and retail stores in the airport.
"By tightening its hub banks, we may see some increased congestion in the terminal at check-in, security, gates, the various United Clubs and airport concessions," Harteveldt said.
Znotins said the rebanking strategy has worked in Houston and Denver.
"Having that day reset every bank does provide operational benefits, and it does put a little bit of pressure on the airport by having the peaks there all at one time. But it's no more pressure than we see at certain times of day in the existing schedule we have at O'Hare now," he said.

Trials and Arbitration Apple Inc. Apple iPhone Apple iOS Samsung Galaxy
Apple Inc was ordered to face a U.S. federal lawsuit claiming it failed to tell consumers that its messaging system would block them from receiving text messages if they switched to Android-based smartphones from iPhones.
U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California said Apple must face plaintiff Adrienne Moore's claim that the message blocking interfered with her contract with Verizon Wireless for wireless service, which she kept after switching in April to a Samsung Galaxy S5 from an iPhone 4.
0
Moore, who seeks class-action status and unspecified damages, claimed that Apple failed to disclose how its iOS 5 software operating system would obstruct the delivery of "countless" messages from other Apple device users if iPhone users switched to non-Apple devices.
In a Monday night decision, Koh said Moore deserved a chance to show Apple disrupted her wireless service contract and violated a California unfair competition law, by blocking messages meant for her.
"Plaintiff does not have to allege an absolute right to receive every text message in order to allege that Apple's intentional acts have caused an actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship," Koh wrote.
The judge also dismissed some claims tied to another California consumer protection law.
Apple did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. Roy Katriel, a lawyer for Moore, did not immediately respond to similar requests.
In court papers, Apple said it never claimed that its iMessage service and Messages application, which ran with iOS 5, would recognize when iPhone users switched to rival devices.
"Apple takes customer satisfaction extremely seriously, but the law does not provide a remedy when, as here, technology simply does not function as plaintiff subjectively believes it should," the Cupertino, California-based company said.
For its fiscal year ended Sept. 27, Apple reported sales of 169.2 million iPhones.
Apple now has an online tool, (https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage), to help people who switch to non-Apple smartphones retrieve messages from iPhone users.
The case is Moore et al v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 14-02269.

Mutual fund managers raised their exposure in bank stocks to an all-time high of nearly Rs 63,000 crore in October this year amid a rally in the stock market.
The move comes after fund managers dropped their investment levels in bank stocks in September, after raising it for seven consecutive months.
According to the latest data available with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), MF investments in bank stocks as on October 31 surged to Rs 62,718 crore, accounting for 19.91 per cent of the total equity assets under management (AUMs) of Rs 3.15 lakh crore.
The previous high was in August this year when investment in the sector climbed to Rs 56,625 crore.
In comparison, the MF industry's exposure to banking sector stood at Rs 55,398 crore in September this year.
MFs had been raising their exposure to banking shares since January.
Software was the second most preferred sector with MFs last month with an exposure of Rs 32,838 crore, followed by pharma (Rs 21,845 crore), auto (Rs 20,282 crore) and finance (Rs 17,843 crore).
Mutual funds are investment vehicles made up of a pool of funds collected from a large number of investors. MFs invest in stocks , bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
According to market participants, MFs have been showing interest in banking stocks since the beginning of the year amid rising equity market.
They believe that the ongoing market rally might see mutual fund assets getting diversified.
Meanwhile, the banking index (bankex) shot up by nearly 11 per cent in October this year, while the 30-scrip BSE Sensex rose 4.64 per cent.
This year has seen a consistent growth in investment in banking stocks by equity fund managers with fund infusion growing from Rs 30,339 crore in January to Rs 62,718 crore in October.
In percentage term, exposure has risen from 16.6 per cent to 19.91 per cent during the period.

Money laundering: Rose Valley scam much bigger than Saradha  says EDDespite dip, Indian rupee first among equals
The mobilisation of money from the market is much more in Rose Valley firm than in the Saradha ponzi firms, Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the money laundering aspects of both the firms, said here.
“The Rose Valley scam is of much bigger magnitude than the Saradha. It is probably six times bigger as Rose Valley had collected deposits of around Rs 15,000 crore from the public”, a source in the directorate said.
To track the money trail of Rose Valley, ED had already frozen around 2500-odd accounts of the firm.
While money can be deposited in those accounts, no amount can be withdrawn from them, the source said.
The source said that public attention was much more in Saradha as it turned out to be a high profile one. The CBI had also been directed to probe the Saradha scam which the agency was doing now along with the ED.
Tracking the accounts of these two firms was a humongous task as each account was having several branch accounts.
“For instance, we have unearthed so far ten lakh accounts for the Saradha group. There could be more which is yet to be ascertained”, the source said.
Relating to Saradha probe, which ED started from April 2013, the source said that identification of substantial part of `crime proceeds’ was over.
“We will be able to file the charge sheet once the predicate offence was established by CBI”, the source said.

New era has dawned in India  says Narendra Modi  makes partnership pitch to ASEANNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Asserting that there are “no irritants” in the India-ASEAN relationship, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today told ASEAN leaders that a new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India and they can be “great partners” for each other.
As India seeks to deepen its engagement with the 10-nation bloc of small and medium economies, Modi said both India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are keen to enhance their cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region.
“The ASEAN community is India’s neighbour. We have ancient relations of trade, religion, culture, art and traditions. We have enriched each other through our interaction. This constitutes a strong foundation of a modern relationship,” Modi said in his opening statement in Hindi at the 12th India-ASEAN summit in the Myanmarese capital.
“That is why our world view is similar in many respects; our mutual confidence and trust is strong. We have no irritants in our relationship. We see encouraging opportunities and challenges in the world in similar ways,” he said.
Observing that India and the ASEAN have been successful to a considerable extent in pursuing their dreams, Modi said they have laid a foundation for a strong and comprehensive strategic partnership.
“My government has been in office for six months and the intensity and momentum with which we have enhanced our engagement in the East, is a reflection of the priority that we give to this region,” the Prime Minister said at the summit held at the sprawling Myanmar International Convention Centre on the second day of his 10-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
“A new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India. Externally, India’s ‘Look East Policy’ has become ‘Act East Policy’,” he said.
“Rapidly developing India and ASEAN can be great partners for each other. We are both keen to enhance our cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region,” the Prime Minister said.

Brent Oil Slips to Just Over $81/Barrel  Near Four-Year LowOil Price Drop Threatens $150 Billion in Investments
London: Brent crude slipped near $81 a barrel on Wednesday, close to a four-year low as a mounting oil glut created by the US shale boom continued to outweigh concerns about supplies from Libya.
With oil prices having fallen 30 per cent since June, OPEC delegates are starting to suggest the producer group could informally cut output by around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it meets in Vienna on November 27.
But delegates within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries warned an agreement will not be easy, and many oil traders and analysts doubt members will take a decisive stance.
"The consensus view is OPEC won't take any action, or if it does, not big enough or sufficiently definitive to have too much impact on prices," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets.
Brent for December delivery fell 62 cents to $81.05 by 0900 GMT. It dropped 67 cents on Tuesday after first touching $80.46, its lowest since September 2010.
US crude was down 66 cents at $77.28 a barrel.
Oversupply, doubts over whether OPEC will cut production and a strong dollar were weighing on prices, said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsExpress.
"I would like to think there is a floor (for Brent) at around $80 a barrel ... but I still see more to play out on the downside," he said.
The market is still assessing whether an OPEC cut of 500,000 bpd would make oil prices more vulnerable to the impact of potential supply disruptions caused by geopolitical risks in Libya and other oil producers, Spooner said.
Exports remained blocked at Libya's 120,000-bpd Hariga port by protesters involved in a wage dispute although talks to resolve the issue were under way, an oil official said on Tuesday. The El Sharara oilfield was also still closed.
"We see few factors in the short term that could stem the decline in prices besides a massive and prolonged outage of Libyan crude, or OPEC intervention," analysts at JBC Energy said in a note, adding they believe OPEC may cut output by 1 million bpd.
US oil inventory data due on Wednesday and Thursday could show a build in crude stocks of 800,000 barrels in the week ended November 7, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.
The weekly fuel stocks data from the American Petroleum Institute and US Energy Information Administration has been delayed by one day due to a federal holiday.

Gold Shines on Wedding Season Demand, Global Cues
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 12, 2014 15:57 (IST)
Kingfisher Airlines Shares Suspended: 10 Things to Know
New Delhi: Gold prices soared by Rs 400 to Rs 26,450 per 10 grams in the national capital today on emergence of buying by jewellers and retailers on the back of ongoing wedding season demand and a firming trend overseas.
Silver also recovered by Rs 350 to Rs 35,500 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Bullion traders said besides ongoing wedding season demand, a firm global trend as the weakening in dollar revived the appeal of the metal as an alternative investment, mainly boosted the sentiment.
Gold in New York, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, gained 0.3 per cent to $1,163 an ounce in yesterday's trade.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity shot up by Rs 400 each to Rs 26,450 and Rs 26,250 per 10 grams, respectively. It had lost Rs 400 in the past two days.
Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 23,700 per piece of eight grams.
In a similar fashion, silver ready recovered by Rs 350 to Rs 35,500 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 110 to Rs 34,600 per kg.
On the other hand, silver coins ruled flat at Rs 58,000 for buying and Rs 59,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Unlikely  alliance : Congress  Shiv Sena demand fresh trust vote in Maha assemblyalliance
(The clamour for fresh trust…)
NEW DELHI: Intensifying the political drama, Congress and Shiv Sena on Wednesday demanded a fresh trust vote in Maharashtra Assembly , soon after the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government won the confidence motion through voice vote.
Shiv Sena MLAs joined Congress in protests outside the Maharashtra assembly. Soon after the trust vote, former Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan said "We will not allow minority government to function in the state." "We're going to protest, appeal to government to bring confidence motion again otherwise this is an illegitimate government," Chavan had said.
Calling the development a "black day" in the history of the state, the two opposition parties announced that they would register their protest with Governor C Vidyasagar Rao.
The 13-day-old BJP government in Maharashtra today won the trust vote in the Assembly. Earlier, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar moved a one-line motion seeking confidence of the House in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, which was put to a voice vote by Speaker Haribhau Bagde.
As the legislators supporting the motion exclaimed "Aye", the Speaker declared it passed, triggering a storm of protest among Shiv Sena and Congress MLAs, who rushed to the Well of the House. Sena earlier in the day formally decided to occupy the main Opposition's space in the Assembly.
"The motion has been passed," Bagde was heard saying over the din. Agitated MLAs of Shiv Sena and Congress were seen arguing with the Speaker even as the decibel level rose steadily, forcing him to adjourn the proceedings.
During the proceedings, members of NCP, which had offered outside support to the BJP government, remained quietly seated.
Sena had earlier staked its claim to the Leader of Opposition's position and the Speaker had said he would take up its demand after the trust vote as Congress too had demanded the post on the grounds that Sena continues to be a constituent of the BJP-led NDA.
As proceedings resumed, the Speaker announced appointment of Sena Legislature Party leader Eknath Shinde as the Leader of the Opposition in the House.
Led by Shinde, Sena MLAs again took up their protest and called for the confidence motion to be determined by a division of votes.
BJP has 121 MLAs and, together with NCP's 41, has the support of 162 MLAs, 18 more than required for a majority in the House which has an effective strength of 287. The party has also claimed the support of seven Independents, three of Bahujan Vikas Aaghadi and some others from smaller parties.

Minority shareholders oppose NSEL merger with Financial Tech
PTI Nov 12, 2014, 05.00PM IST
(NSEL does not have the…)
NEW DELHI: Some minority shareholders of Financial Technologies have raised objections to the proposed merger of scam-hit National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) with the company.
To ensure faster recovery of dues for entities hit by the Rs 5,600 crore fraud at NSEL, the government last month ordered the merger of the bourse with its parent firm Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL).
This is also the first time that the Corporate Affairs Ministry ordered a forced merger of private entities using a provision in the Companies Act that allows the government to intervene for "essential public interest".
Sources said the ministry has received objections from some minority shareholders on the proposed amalgamation.
Specific details were not immediately available. The payment crisis at NSEL came to light in July 2013 and the decision to merge it with FTIL has been taken as the bourse is "not left with any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of dues".
The proposal would have a final shape after taking into account submissions or objections made by the shareholders and creditors of the two companies.
Comments have been sought from them till December 20. NSEL's entire business, properties and liabilities, among others, would be transferred to FTIL after the merger, as per the draft order issued on October 21.
According to it, FTIL has not furnished any explanation as to what steps have been taken by NSEL or by FTIL itself as a parent company to honour the commitment of assuring safety and risk-free trading to the members and clients of the exchange.
NSEL does not have the resources, financial or human, or the organisational capability to successfully recover the dues pending for over a year, the draft order had said.
On the rationale of merger, it had said the government is of the considered opinion that the leverage combined assets, capital and reserves for efficient administration and satisfactory settlement of rights and liabilities of stakeholders and creditors of NSEL would be in "essential public interest".
The Ministry had also said that FTIL cannot be allowed to confine its responsibility and concern only for the small investors alone and it has to shoulder full responsibility for the outstanding dues at NSEL.

Net Neutrality: Access and costs are top issues(Free to do as they pleased,…)
By Eduardo Porter
What is the problem with the Internet in the United States?
On Monday, President Barack Obama urged the Federal Communications Commission to set stringent "net neutrality" rules to ensure the free flow of content on the information superhighway.
The regulations, he said, should ensure that "neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online." To do so, he suggested classifying consumer broadband as a public utility - like telephone service or delivering electricity to your home - allowing the FCC to set precise proscriptions covering quality of service.
In principle, this makes sense. It is hard to overstate the importance of broadband to America's economy and society. Free to do as they pleased, the clutch of companies that control access to the Internet would have enormous power to determine what information reaches Americans online.
But would the cure be worse than the disease, entangling the Internet in an endless fight over regulation and perhaps slowing investment in one of the nation's most vital services?
To some extent, it depends on how you view the threat. For Gene Kimmelman, president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge, what's at stake is no less than U.S. democracy. He can remember 1992, when he was at the Consumer Federation of America pushing a bill that would re-regulate the cable industry and allow new satellite competitors into the market.
"I had well-funded satellite providers on my side," he told me. "There was no cable company that would take their ads." Left free to decide which content flowed through their pipes, broadband providers could similarly deploy their power in the service of their political preferences.
The more prosaic - though actually trickier - issue net neutrality is meant to address is about price. Should broadband providers be allowed to charge providers of content differentially for different speeds or tiers of services?
Consumer groups and free speech advocates like Public Knowledge argue this is a surefire way to split the Internet into "haves" - deep-pocketed companies that would pay to have their movies delivered at blistering speed - and "have-nots" that would be relegated to a congested, snail-paced lane.
The smart kid with the clever new idea would no longer be able to compete with established players in the fast lane. The Internet would lose its garage-based engine of creativity.
These concerns shouldn't be lightly dismissed. In a world where the Koch brothers will spend tens of millions to install conservative Republicans in office, Kimmelman's political fears are not far-fetched.
Still, the threats articulated by the staunchest defenders of a neutral Internet do not quite amount to an imminent danger, nor do they necessarily call for an all-out embrace of traditional regulation.
Political spending might be at record highs. But the nation's broadband goliaths have not, in fact, been using their might to throttle speech online. And they are likely to think twice before, say, alienating Democratic consumers by using their pipes to favor Republican causes.
What's more, the threat to speech is the most easily addressed, via a straightforward ban against blocking or throttling legal content.
The pricing threat is even more nebulous. Companies engage in differential pricing all the time, and broadband providers would surely do so if allowed. But that often serves consumers well.
Robert Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology Innovation Foundation, noted that it would make sense for services like Skype, which needs its bits to arrive at their destination in a tight, precise sequence, to pay Internet service providers to prioritize their calls over email that doesn't require such careful timing.
  Or think of, say, T-Mobile offering to exclude music services from its data cap in order to attract more consumers. Syntonic, whose technology allows companies to provide sponsored content to customers free over wireless carriers, is in fact broadening access by low-income consumers.
These forms of discrimination hardly affect other traffic. And with average speeds already around 10 megabits per second, notes Atkinson, "the market for prioritization is going to be a lot smaller than people think."
To date, the most notable instance of anything resembling paid prioritization is Netflix's payment to Comcast, Time Warner Cable, AT&T and Verizon to ensure its shows flowed smoothly on their pipes. Netflix accused the broadband providers of slowing its content on purpose to get paid and strongly supports tougher net neutrality rules.
Still, the charge looks like a not-unreasonable congestion fee to cover the added costs of handling its voluminous traffic. Comcast could either charge Netflix or require all its consumers to shoulder the burden. Its choice is hardly unreasonable.

Nifty Hits Record High Above 8,400; Banks, Auto Stocks Lead
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 17:17 (IST)
Kingfisher Airlines Shares Suspended: 10 Things to Know
The BSE Sensex and Nifty touched record highs for the second time this week as rate-sensitive stocks such as Axis Bank rose on hopes easing inflation would prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates earlier than expected.
Consumer inflation in October is expected to have eased to a record low of 5.80 per cent, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, according to a Reuters poll.
If the forecast is met, it would also make the RBI's inflation targets - 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent a year later - appear more attainable.
"The market is expecting inflation to come down very fast. So if the rates are not cut then certainly some momentum will be lost," said Vinod Nair, head of fundamental research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd.
The Sensex closed 0.35 per cent up, after earlier rising as much as 0.78 per cent to an all-time high of 28,126.48.
The Nifty rose 0.25 per cent after earlier gaining as much as 0.63 per cent to a record high of 8,415.05.

Tata Motors also advanced 2 per cent on optimism ahead of its September-quarter earnings on Friday.
Tyre shares rose as investors expect falling crude oil and rubber price to boost companies' margins.

Bayer CropScience ended up 10.2 per cent after earlier marking its all-time high of Rs 2,749 after its September-quarter profit growth bucked the trend of weak earnings at rivals.
Among decliners, consumer goods stocks fell on worries that higher-than-expected good and services tax (GST) may restrict profit growth. Media reports on Wednesday said a government panel suggested GST rate of 27 per cent.

Indian pharma companies well positioned for global growth  says S&P reportEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
As countries increasingly focus on affordable health care, the Indian pharmaceutical firms are well positioned for global growth, says a report by Global rating agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P).
The report titled “Indian Pharmaceutical Companies Have A Global Opportunity, If They Conquer Compliance Issues,” by S&P Ratings Services published today, however, said failure to comply with the stringent quality requirements in developed markets is a key factor.
“Expansion into developed markets, especially the US, is positive for the credit profiles of Indian pharmaceutical companies. The market’s size and the absence of price controls are likely to support the revenue growth and profitability,” Standard & Poor’s credit analyst Vishal Kulkarni said.
The growth prospects are particularly high for Indian companies in the speciality and complex generic drugs segment in the US, the report said.
However, failure on compliance with regulations could seriously hurt creditworthiness. It could lead to disruptions in production, import bans, remediation costs, and above all reputational and litigation risks, it added.
While the largest 10 Indian pharmaceutical companies are much smaller in terms of revenue than their global generics peers, they make up for it by their robust product pipeline, the report said.
“What the Indian companies lack in size is largely offset by their strong product pipeline, presence in emerging markets, and conservatively maintained financial health,” Kulkarni said in the report.

Aurobindo Pharma set to acquire US-based Natrol for $133 mnEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Aurobindo Pharma is all set to acquire troubled US-based nutritional supplement maker, Natrol Inc for USD 132.5 million (over Rs 810 crore) after emerging as the highest bidder for acquisition.
Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc, a subsidiary of the Hyderabad-based firm, has emerged as the highest bidder for acquisition of Natrol Inc and other affiliate entities, under a process to be finally approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
“Under the auction process, Aurobindo USA emerged as the highest and best bidder with a bid of USD 132.5 million to acquire the assets of Natrol with an agreement to take on certain liabilities,” Aurobindo Pharma said in a statement.
The buyout of Natrol would provide the right platform for creating a fully-integrated OTC platform in the US and other international markets, it added.
Natrol, which manufactures and sells nutritional supplements in US and other international markets, provides Aurobindo with strong brand reputation and presence in a variety of attractive supplement markets, it said.
“This acquisition is subject to final approval by the US court and other statutory approvals as may be required, including any termination of the waiting period or approval under the HSR Act, and closing conditions as per the Asset Purchase Agreement,” Aurobindo Pharma said.
Barclays acted as the sole financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as the legal counsel to Aurobindo USA, it added.
Aurobindo Pharma shares were trading at Rs 1,066 apiece on the BSE, up 3.69 per cent from its previous close.

Narendra Modi meets Aung San SuuKyiSuu Kyi called on Modi at the Park Royal Hotel. (File photo)
Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:59 pm
Prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday met Mayanmar’s opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on the sidelines of the Asean summit here during his maiden trip to Southeast Asia.
Suu Kyi called on Modi at 6 pm local time at the Park Royal Hotel, where the Indian delegation is staying. This was Modi’s first meeting with the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. During the course of the meeting, Suu Kyi, who has studied in India, said that she considered the country to be her “second home”.
The meeting comes at a time when Myanmar is in the middle of a national debate on whether to allow Suu Kyi to contest the 2015 parliamentary elections, from which she is barred due to a provision in the Constitution. Suu Kyi had last visited the country in November 2012.
In October, ahead of the ASEAN summit, Myanmar’s president U Thein Sein had held rare talks with Suu Kyi, who had repeatedly been rebuffed by the administration till then. After garnering international praise for helping steer the country from a military dictatorship to democracy, President Thein Sein’s nominally civilian government has, in recent weeks, been facing criticism in the wake of a stalemate in early political reforms and peace talks with ethnic rebels.
US President Barack Obama, who is slated to be here on Thursday for the East Asia Summit, will also meet Suu Kyi.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.

Discount to retail investors urged for IPOs of PSUsDiscount to retail investors urged for IPOs of PSUs
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 12:  
Government should give discounts to retail investors when it lists state—owned entities like the Airports Authority of India and helicopter operator Pawan Hans, BSE chief Ashish Chauhan said.
The move will help increase participation of retail investors, providing momentum to the primary market.
“The government should give discount to retail investors whenever it comes out with the IPOs of companies like AAI and Pawan Hans,” Chauhan told PTI.
Apart from that, he said government should also give discount to retail investors in the OFS (Offer for Sale) and follow—on public offer (FPO) of state—owned companies.
Most of the companies give a discount of up to 5 per cent on the final offer price to this group of investors.
As IPOs come via the book building process, 35 per cent of the net offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).
Further, up to 15 per cent is meant for High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) or corporates who bid for more than Rs 2 lakh. The rest, 50 per cent, is reserved for retail or individual investors who invest up to Rs 2 lakh.
Proposals for listing of AAI and Pawan Hans have been made in the Draft Civil Aviation Policy. Besides, government is planning to divest 10 per cent of its stake in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. It has already filed draft papers with the market regulator SEBI for the public offer.
AAI, a ‘Miniratna’ Public Sector Enterprise, manages 125 airports across the country, including 11 International, 81 domestic and eight Customs Airports. It also manages 25 Civil Enclaves at Defence Airfields.
Pawan Hans Ltd was incorporated in 1985. Government holds 51 per cent stake in it, while 49 per cent is with state—run ONGC.

Bharatiya Janata Party shakes up election race in Jammu and KashmirLetters to  the editor
Accompanied by half a dozen guards, Hina Bhat knocks on doors in Srinagar to persuade Kashmiris to vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in this month’s state election.
After winning the biggest national mandate in 30 years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP has launched its most audacious election project yet – to win power in Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir.
It is Modi’s toughest test – his party has no base in the Kashmir Valley where it is seen as anti-Muslim. Even more of a red rag is the BJP’s long-held demand to abrogate the Himalayan region’s special status in the Constitution.
Its aggressive posture toward Pakistan is just as menacing to the people.
And yet, within weeks, Modi has shaken up an election race dominated by two regional groups and the Congress party. A former separatist leader, Sajjad Lone, met Modi this week and said the BJP leader could change Kashmir’s fortunes.
A poll on Tuesday said the BJP would win the most seats ever in Jammu and Kashmir but fall short of its goal of 44 in the 87-seat state assembly.
“There is only one mantra and that is development. The hunger for development in Kashmir is the same as the rest of country, if not more,” said BJP strategist Ram Madhav.
“We want a state government that can move shoulder-to-shoulder with Modi.”
Bhat, a dentist-turned-politician, offers voters exhausted by years of strife the vision that Modi promises to the rest of India – of “smart” cities and expressways.
To voters recovering from the worst floods in a century, those plans are a far cry from reality.
In September, the river Jhelum overflowed and flooded Srinagar, destroying homes and livelihoods, and fuelling anger against the state administration.
Two months on, people are still clearing up. The city – famed for the mountains that flank it and the houseboats on its mirror-calm lake – looks like a bomb hit it.
“You need a force to get things moving. In Modi we see that force,” Bhat says.
Hers is a tough act in a district where many voters heed calls by separatists to shun elections.
TARGETING HINDUS
The BJP is banking on support in Hindu-dominated Jammu as well as in Buddhist Ladakh to pick up seats.
In the Kashmir Valley they hope to win over independents, engineer splits in regional parties and get Hindus who fled to register and vote.
The Hindus are a minority in Kashmir but their votes become important if many Muslims boycott. The election begins on Nov. 25 and will be in stages, with results due in December.
Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference separatist alliance, sees the BJP’s ploy as cynical.
“Not only are they trying to win the election through default, they are trying to split Muslims into Shias and Sunnis – and even within Sunnis a further split,” he said. “It’s dangerous.”
At the same time, the government is silencing independent voices, he says. India cancelled talks with Pakistan in August after a Hurriyat leader met Pakistan’s envoy to India.
“In the beginning we thought the BJP’s talk of taking power in Kashmir was rhetoric. But they are going about it systematically. At the very least, they want to be in a position where they will play a role in government,” said Noor Ahmad Baba, a Kashmir University politics professor.

Congress legislators disrupt Governor s address in Maha AssemblyPrint

By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 6:48 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 7:09 pm
Congress legislators in Maharashtra on Wednesday disrupted Governor Vidyasagar Rao’s Address to the joint session of the state legislature, protesting the manner in which the 13-day-old BJP government won the trust vote.
Congress MLAs shouted slogans like “Dadagiri nahin chalegi (no bullying tactics),” and “Governor go back” as Rao began his Address.
Raising slogans like “down with the minority  government,” the Congress legislators walked out before the Governor could complete his Address.
Earlier, Sena legislators tried to stop the Governor from entering the Vidhan Bhawan to deliver his Address, and handed over to him a memorandum complaining the “unconstitutional” manner in which the vote of confidence was passed earlier in the day.

The Congress legislators including former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan squatted on the stairs of the Vidhan Bhawan building and blocked the Governor’s entry.
MPCC chief Manikrao Thakre said outside Vidhan Bhawan that no poll was taken during the trust vote today and it had become clear that the BJP government had trampled upon the Governor’s directives to have a vote of confidence.
The state Congress, soon after the trust vote, had sent a letter to the Governor requesting him not to deliver his Address to the joint session.
“The minority BJP government which has a strength of 123 MLAs when the majority mark is 145 was asked to prove majority in the House. But the motion was not put to vote. The BJP has not followed your directives and hence it is an unconstitutional government,” the letter said.
The party sought time from the Governor to explain the developments in the Legislative Assembly and said if the demand was not accepted it will resort to severe agitation.

What Are the Advantages of Hiring a Military VeteranWhat are the advantages of hiring someone who has been in the US military? originally appeared on Quora : The best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter , Facebook , and Google+ .
Answer by Jon Davis , Sergeant of Marines. Fought in Iraq during OIF
I am going to speak as a Marine and a former hiring manager. I was once a Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps with two Iraq tours and have worked in the retail, real estate, the tech industry start-up and education sectors. In that time, I've hired more than enough people to know that it's one of the hardest decisions you have to regularly make. The choices of who you bring into an organization will either make or break you far quicker than anything you as the individual are capable of. I also know that almost all the decisions you make as a hiring manager happen as the sum result of the generalizations and stereotypes you have attached to the bullet points on their résumé. Don't feel bad. It's important to not follow that instinct that all individuals are fundamentally good and fundamentally the same. That's how you get robbed and your employees drive your company into the ground.
The facts are, you rely on those generalizations to give you the best guess of who is going to add value to your company's culture and who isn't going to burn the place to the ground. That said, what happens when you see military experience show up in your inbox? What generalizations do you hold? Do you really not know what it is you're looking at? Would you like to know more? The problem with many hiring managers is that they have no idea what it means when they see a veteran's resume. What qualities should you expect? What flaws? What do they add? How are they different from someone else? I wrote this piece to help communicate what to expect. Hopefully after reading you will be able to make an informed decision. You'll be able to know better if this applicant is not only a good worker for you, but also someone who can grow and drive your company in the future, someone who can grow with you, and maybe even someone who can help you take your operations to the next level.
Leadership is Ingrained in Vets
What many people don't know is that the United States Marine has an average age of only 19. What? Yes, that Marine is incredibly young, but it still needs to be led. Who do you think is doing this? 19 year olds. By the time most people are twenty in the Marines (this goes for the other services, as well) they are already an NCO. This stands for Non-Commissioned-Officer. Don't let the "Non" throw you off. What an NCO means is, "The guy in charge who will make my life Hell if I screw up," or just as often, "the guy whose job it is to make sure I stay alive." By the age of 20 some kids have already become technical experts in a professional field, are teachers to younger service-members and have led small teams in everything from shop operations to combat deployments.
By the time I was 22 I was a Sergeant in charge of a team of 13 other Marines. We were all occupying very technical jobs in the computer networking field and  responsible for overseeing the maintenance and distribution of over $3 million dollars of Marine Corps property. You probably might think that that was a stupid investment on someone so young, but we pulled it off, with no fanfare I might add, and we did things like that all the time. It wasn't until I received a degree in Business Management at 25, that the civilian world could trust me again with doing the same thing. I suppose, on the outside, people can't be trusted with that kind of responsibility. Every day, though, vets do. The fact is that I could not have done this alone. I had those thirteen Marines who did the work and it was my job to coordinate. I had a very solid framework for leadership that include such gems as the Five Paragraph Order, Six Troop Leading steps, and the Thirteen Leadership Traits. These have become pivotal to my personal growth as a manager, teacher, and how I lead others. The military philosophies on the science of leading aren't something that leave you. The military trains Service Members to lead by example. Skills like motivation and delegation are actually given time to be trained and implemented in the most hostile environments imaginable.
The military doesn't just educate their members on the practical ways to manage behavior, such as the discipline and communication methods. Leadership is truly studied on the academic and theoretical level. More so than in other organization, this theoretical and practical leadership are put in practice as a matter of survival.
You want another note on leadership? In the military, no one can be fired, not at the bottom tiers at least. That means that you have to get the job done with the idiots God gave you. You are out there for seven to fourteen months with no replacements and just the same team along with all their problems. You have to train them, discipline them, correct them, counsel them and shape them, because you have no other choices. You didn't even get to hire them. They were just assigned to you, more or less, at random. That is another reason why vets have such strong leadership skills. Could you honestly say that you could run a company the way the Marines do, with their success record, if you couldn't even pick who gets hired and can't even get rid of the ones who suck? You probably couldn't, but the military does. Choosing team members and leaders who have proven they are able to do this means that you are choosing team members who are adaptable and know how to lead others.
Vets Understand Responsibility
In most veterans you will see a strong vein of personal integrity. It isn't that they are better people than anyone else, far to the point. Many are socially unacceptable misfits by most people's terms. It is that integrity is driven to such a degree that it is presented as a matter of life or death. Ethics and standards of behavior are codified, their policed, and a part of life to the point that it is a standard which will follow an individual. In the civilian world, that doesn't go away. It creates employees with a proven track record of trustworthiness that are often assets to the organizations they join after they leaving military service.
I don't mean to imply that civilians have no integrity. To contrary, there are many who are the most reliable people I have ever met, but in my experience, it can be hit or miss. In one job I had, by the time I had worked there for no more than a month nearly the entire staff had called out sick at least once, people wouldn't show up for work, complained incessantly, and generally, would do anything to avoid work. It wasn't legitimate sickness. It was dishonesty and an inability to be relied upon. The worst part... corporate wouldn't even let me fire them! I know that I said that the Marines and the military in general can't be fired and that makes vets good leaders, but firing people is a tool and needs to be used when you have it. Let's face it, because of lawyers and HR reps afraid of wrongful termination lawsuits, people can get away with murder without being let go far too often. This blows the minds of some vets.
In the military there are no sick days. I am not exaggerating. You absolutely must come to work and then must go to Sick Call before they will ever acknowledge that there might be something wrong with you. And if it is a PT day you will run three miles before you get to go.
When on deployment we also work every day. Every single day. There are no holidays, no weekends, no birthdays. It is the same thing every day. If you show up late, even by five minutes, or so, you will be running for miles or end up digging a massive fighting hole and 300 sandbags in an effort to make the base more secure. (It's not really about making the base more secure.) So you learn how not to get punished. In the civilian world they don't reward this behavior, but they also don't punish the latter.
"Why should I reward them for doing their jobs?" some might say.
"Because you won't punish them for not doing it." I'd reply.
People like us show up early, stay late and if you ask them to do something they work hard to see that it is done. In the worst case scenario, they will be responsible enough to tell you when they need help.  There is a point I made in the last section that I would like to take the opportunity to repeat for emphasis.
By the time I was 22 I was a Sergeant in charge of a team of 13 other Marines. We were all occupying very technical jobs in the computer networking field and  responsible for overseeing the maintenance and distribution of over $3 million dollars of Marine Corps property.
Most organizations wouldn't consider this type of thing a wise decision, but in the military it is common for very young people to be given a great deal of responsibility, relative to civilian counterparts. You wonder how. This might help. Image you give an 18-year-old a rifle and tell him that it is only thing that will protect his life for next seven months. Follow this up with a few months of proof and little else but living with the constant reminder of this fact and I promise you that rifle will not be lost, broken, damaged and will come back to you polished and good as new. I promise. Military people get responsibility because when they were very young, there were serious consequences to the decisions they made. Civilians don't go through this kind of trial by fire and training and many of them don't make good decisions because of it. The military has given young men and women real life and death responsibility and choices before a regular civilian would have graduated college.
Intuition is a skill. It can be learned. The military teaches it.
What many people think is that leaders are born. Not in the military. Simply put, many times in the military people are presented with situations where they must make life and death decisions in the blink of an eye. How do you do that given that there are no pie charts to help you make the decision, no data scientists to weigh all the variables and no spreadsheets, journals or time to decide? Intuition. How exactly do you trust that someone will make the right decision when you plan to throw them into that kind of situation? Faith in a system of training which focuses on immediate decision making in response to only the information available at the time, intuition. The Marines and the military train intuition into their culture. You might not even know what intuition really is. Well, here goes.
Intuition is the ability to take massive amounts of information and quickly come to a decision from all possible options quickly and correctly. It is the precise execution of understanding gained through experience and study. You don't do it with charts and graphs, you do it by absorbing all the knowledge available to you ahead of time and making it so readily available that the employee can access it at any given moment they wish. This sounds a lot like memory, but there is more than just recalling information. This means using that mental database to its fullest capacity. They are also able to sort through it and glean the right information without all the excessive over analysis that comes with having an abundance of information and options, often labeled "analysis paralysis" that can accompany a lot corporate level thinkers. This is one of the hardest things in the world to do and most people think you are either born with the ability you aren't. This is a false assumption given to many by a society that worships heroes who magically just know what to do. Intuition, in truth, is a trainable skill and the vets have it already.
What they don't have? They may not have the specific job essential abilities and skills you need. Provide them the training and let it add to their knowledge base. After that, let them use what they know, namely the ability to think, a skill often missing from many fresh college grads. You just have to provide the training and watch them succeed in implementing it.
Military people will tell you when something is wrong, even when you don't like it, often.
I remember, more than just about anything in the military, life is punctuated with a steady stream of inspections. Almost impossibly high standards are demanded in everything from uniforms to gear. Even after getting out, the habit of a strong sense of standards runs deep. Vets have the wont of maintaining a certain level of acceptability in operations, safety, and professionalism in others. This often is directed downwards, but they also develop built in mechanisms for directing problems that are discovered upwards as well. Many that I know, also have a real problem not accepting that same level excellence in others. If a failure is present, expect the vet to let you know.
You need to understand that the military are people who have an incredible amount of responsibility, not only for "company property", but for lives. Many seem to think that you give them an order, they say, "Sir, yes, sir!" and run off to their doom like mindless drones. It actually doesn't work that way, and I'm sorry if that is what you want from a veteran employee. Remember, they've spent years earning respect and a place of distinction as field experts so expecting them to just go to a point of utter subservience to you is both demeaning and ridiculous. It also throws away one of their most valuable assets, their independence and strength of character to be able to tell those they work with when something is wrong without damaging those relationships. This really does go back to the habit of self preservation, in that you don't just do what that young and inexperienced officer says when your experience tells you, it's going to get you killed. National security and all, but you are going to at least offer your opinion before leaping off the cliff like a flock of lemmings.
That, however, is what I see in a lot of corporate scenarios I have seen and been a part of... Lemmings. Yes Men. If you all you're looking for is a government sponsored yesman, you should keep looking. Most veterans won't accept a place where their input isn't valued and they shouldn't. They have valuable knowledge, training and skills. That said, they aren't going to disrespect you just to let their opinion be known. A military person knows how to use tact, a word I am learning more and more, doesn't seem to appear in lexicon of most industry professionals. They will try to communicates to you that you may not be making a good choice. That much needs to be expected, so fragile egos need not apply. They are also not so afraid of you as to speak their mind when they have a good idea or think that one of yours could use a second look. They already have self-confidence gained through life experience. This type of mentality is important, but is often squashed by egotistical bosses.
Vets can get the job done in an environment where they are trained to succeed in.
When you make the choice to hire a veteran, you can know that when you give them a task they will do it, provided they have the means and support to get the job done. If it is safe, sound, and smart, vets will go at the task without the "incentive programs", "rewards", "blue jeans days" and all the other forms of extrinsic motivation that get in the way of doing business with a bunch of self-centered egotists. Veterans know what it means to have something that needs to be done. Vets have gained a sense of urgency and have seen the world through a big picture type mentality. If you ask them to do something they aren't going to complain because it is too tough, too hard or infringes on their break time. When you need someone who is willing to work the long hours, do the hard tasks and the seemingly impossible, remember that in the back of their heads is, "Well at least I'm not getting shot at." They have a strong respect for procedures and accountability. Service members know how policies and procedures enable an organization to be successful and they easily understand their place within an organizational framework. Vets get the obligation that comes with being responsible for the actions of subordinates and they understand how to properly alleviate issues through the proper supervisory channels.
Considering that, you may wonder why veterans you have worked with in the past, didn't shape up like what was expected. A good thing to consider is that most hiring managers hire veterans with the wrong idea in mind. Usually, they are hiring lower to mid-level managers of whatever it is they are doing because that is the experience level that most veterans have. The problem is that these individuals often lack much of the tacit knowledge others gain through working their way up through the civilian side of the latter. You might be surprised at some of the things you would think are obvious that a veteran just won't think of at first. It's important to remember that most of their knowledge comes from the military, not civilian side of any industry, which has its own culture, regulations, implications, and priorities. That said, they solve problems in a completely different manner. They will do things completely differently than you have seen in your career. Often, this will be good because of the diversity it brings. Without an understanding of what is good in a civilian industry model, however, their techniques may be harmful. This is why, in the beginning, you should watch your veteran employees more to gear them for the new industry and be patient with these new mid-level employees making mistakes you wouldn't otherwise expect from more junior employees who have worked the civilian side for a while.
That said, the important element of this combination is you giving them the instructions. If you don't provide the support they need to do the work, they will fail. If you don't make wise decisions and then ask them to do stupid things, they will fail. If you don't make it possible for them do their job right, they will fail. Given a good vet and good task, however, they will never fail you. That's why it is so important for managers to know that many military people need a great deal of structure in the beginning to survive in many organizations. They need to be trained well and given a solid framework with which to perform. Many hiring managers make the mistake of believing they will simply be able to hire a veteran and then that veteran will be a magic wand which can "get things done" absent any real training or supervision from the manager. This may happen, but just as likely that veteran employee might go off and drive your company or division into some random direction because you didn't adequately direct their energy with training or guidance. Their drive is a useful fuel for the engine of progress in any strong company, but could just as easily have them fixing thousands of problems that either aren't problems or don't need to be fixed right now. They might even cause new issues because the military teaches and encourages movement and drive. If you don't show them where they need to focus and what they need to do, then you have created a thermite mixture; a high energy burn that causes a big flash but usually breaks more than it builds.
When given a proper framework and adequate training, your veteran employees can amaze you at how hard they can work and what they can get done. Once that framework is established, many veterans are extremely independent. The thing that so many people seem to think about vets is that they want to have the strict and regimented hierarchy. Think about it, there is a reason they left the military. Most, in my experience, are confident in their abilities and just want to be left alone or to get busy with their team without strong supervision. From that point have flexibility to work strongly in teams or work independently. Military training teaches service members to work as a team by instilling a sense of a responsibility to one's colleagues. In addition, the size and scope of military operations necessitates that service members understand how groups of all sizes relate to each other and support the overarching objective. While military duties stress teamwork and group productivity, they also build individuals who are able to perform independently at a very high level. As I mentioned before, military vets can be extremely independent. There have been numerous reports that show that military vets are more likely to start their own businesses than other demographic groups. They have natural drives to solve complex problems. They think tactically and strategically about problems. If you have given them the training and a framework to work within your organization they will be able to achieve your goals in ways you hadn't considered before. They are resourceful and know how to use what assets they are given rather than look outside for support. This is what makes them entrepreneurial by nature and can help grow your companies from the inside rather than just be another task follower.
The Government Pays Them to get Educated, so You Don't Have to.
Military vets come equipped with knowledge that isn't comparable to most others. The United States military boasts some of the most educated war fighters in the world, not to mention in the history of warfare. All US service members must have, at the time of their enlistment, a high school diploma or the general equivalency diploma. To be more clear, more than 99% of those enlisted have a high school education comparable to about 60% that you will find in the general population. Also compared to the population of the United States more service members have also attended some college compared to their typical 18 to 24-year-old counterparts. They have all also passed a standardized test on to test for skills in English proficiency, mathematics, science and government. This test also serves as a placement exam for military jobs. Curious about the rigorous qualifications required to be good enough to join the United States Military? United States Military Enlistment Standards . Good luck.
To top this, most MOS schools or Military Occupational Specialty schools boast world-class educational training. First, you have to be good enough to get into the school you want, which can have very high scores required to get in. No, we don't have the greatest recreational facilities and the dorms suck. It isn't the Ivy League, but the education level is beyond par. While stationed in 29 Palms California, a hole in the middle of the California desert, I received two years worth of the most rigorous training in Computer Science, Data Network Administration and Information Systems maintenance. I say two-year except that I only had six months to do it. The training is taken very seriously. In 29 Palms I was 19-year-old PFC working on workstations and equipment with a cost of over half a million dollars, a task, by the way, I would be doing in the real world very soon anyway.
In your typical civilians education, students are allowed to pass with virtually any grade so long as they beg enough. In the military, every test is a fail if scored under an 80%, and if you fail you can be booted from the program. This is because, in the civilian education world, a school which doesn't pass enough student's isn't viewed as exclusive, it is viewed as too hard. Students then refuse to attend, dropping tuition payments and the courses must be reevaluated to encourage more revenue. In the military, standards aren't questioned. The service member fails and gets to demoted to a job set he can handle.
Add to this, military veterans are virtually the only class of citizens which earns a full ride scholarship to most any higher education they wish. While this is overlooked today, with a society where fresh college graduates are severely overpopulated and under educated, in the future labor will be a much more scarce commodity. Add to this, you have a person who already comes equipped with all the other training they've already endured. Lastly, if you have in your employ a trusted veteran who has not yet used his GI Bill, you have an amazing asset. You, as the employer, can encourage that employee to get their education and work for you during that time. Given a few years, you will have a marvelous manager with years experience and ready to take the reigns you've prepared for them. The best part of this arrangement is that you don't have to pay for this. Many companies offer this as an incentive to join and in the future it will become a more common benefit. You, however, get to save that carrot for a Master's degree.
Useful Diversity
Many companies hire a large portion of their staff where diversity is the prime differentiator. The theory is that diversity gives a company a large base of ideas with which to draw from for problem solving. This is thought of, normally, as racial or ethnic diversity, but can be applied to different backgrounds and even sub-cultures as well. This form of diversity is important, especially when the discussion of civil rights is a matter at hand. That said, in and of itself, ethnicity should not be considered a quality companies should hire for if the goal is to hire for diversity. What types of diversity are necessary for company success and evolution are those which make an individual useful while being very different from everyone else in the organization. Race and ethnicity, all else equal, rarely does this.
There are not ethnicities that provide true, useful diversities any culture, but there are cultures that add unique and predictable experiences that can help companies prosper. These cultures have their quirks, eccentricities, values, specialties, and perspectives which can guide teams in new directions and solve unique problems. For that reason, the real question isn't if you are finding a HR perfect, color coordinated team page, but if you have a team with real depth based on a broad range of experiences. The better question might be for hiring managers, "Which cultures out there might add value, because they just care a lot about getting things done?" The point of diversity is not just to get different people working together, but also to get many different experience sets working together.
Think of it this way. If you build your diversity around different countries of origin, but everyone in the company has an almost identical skillsets, which were gained through almost identical means, how have you actually diversified your experience base? Say you are fortunate enough to have the ability to hire a team of Harvard graduates. Harvard is arguably the best university in the world in most many important fields. It is extremely exclusive and extremely competitive. For that reason, one would assume that success would come from a group such as this. Likely, it will, but the question is, will be it the greatest success? Consider adding in a few people from Stanford. Now you have two cultures of success with with two very different education systems. Different solutions are going to come from these two groups, one all of Harvard and one of a mixed class. Now consider how very different would the solutions formed from a group mixed in with a few graduates of the United States Naval Academy, or even one of self made entrepreneurial millionaires? How vastly different would the solutions to various problems be if such an amalgamation were to exist? The truth of the matter is that sometimes the Harvard group will sometimes create the best solution. Still, many other times, they will miss many things were would have been extremely obvious to everyone else, in spite of their individual and collective brilliance. For that reason, most of the time the greatest solution will come from the highly diversified group. They still have access to all their personal thought processes and their successful cultural quirk, but also now have access to another, the solutions that only become visible when multiple viewpoints are combined. This is a strategic asset and which can't be replicated easily which means that the culture you build will differentiate you from other firms like you.
Few people can add as much constructive diversity as a military veteran. Few cultures have been engineered quite like those that military veterans have had memberships within. There are even fewer cultures that focus entirely on mission achievement, cooperation, and personal development. The fact is there is no culture in the world that shapes people in the way the military does. It changes people into something that civilians don't really understand. What is more important is that it gives them options, mentalities, philosophies and a framework that sees opportunities and solves problems that will pass up most civilians. Even more important is that the thoughts going through their minds are centered around finding the problem and fixing it in the fastest and most efficient ways possible.
So to achieve useful diversity, it isn't to focus on just bringing in different people, but people who have had experience successful cultures, cultures that somehow add value and are different than the culture already present an organization. That isn't to say that the military is the only good and achieving culture in the world. It is just another one. What you want, to be clear, is an environment where there is a constant collision of successful problem solving systems in which only unique and inventive ideas can be generated. I know that this last section is more a concept of general business theory and not so centric on the military's contribution to hiring a veteran. Well, I did graduated Cum Laude from business school and now run my own publishing firm, so I hope you take the advice regardless.
Having said this, when you start to try to diversify you team for success, you're going to need a team which is capable of working with diversity. It isn't built in. I will ask you a series of questions that might make it more clear why I would suggest a few military members be incorporated into such a team. What type of people have experience with extremely diverse teams? What type of group regularly asks its members to uproot and join new units and new teams? What is a group made of people from many different ethnic groups, income brackets, religious backgrounds and still manages to achieve world class results? What type of group regularly takes part in international activities with different cultures in which the fate of the mission revolves around team work? What type of group gives its members a huge amount of international travel and experience living abroad? It's obvious the point I am making here. The military systematically builds individuals with experience that, later on as an unintended benefit, are built to join new groups of highly diverse individuals. More than that, the military is a culture which focuses on achievement, so by adding their processes to your own, you incorporate individuals who are already highly achieved in the arts of teamwork.
Adaptability and Global Thinkers
I remember when I was a young Marine I thought my only job would be to work on computers. I signed on to be a 0656, Tactical Data Network Specialist, which meant I did the same job of an IT support or network administrator, only I did it in a godforsaken desert or jungle environment with absolutely zero internal or external logistical support and with the possibility that my entire relay could be blown up on any given day. Most people don't even realize the Marines have a computer nerd job specialty, but we do. It's actually quite sophisticated and since my day has evolved to become part of the US' strategy for offensive and defensive cyber operations. By the time I was 19, I was able to do what most people spend years in technical school attempting to be qualified for. It wasn't my only job, though. After my first Iraq tour, the unit had to immediately begin getting ready for the next one. That meant training and most importantly, marksmanship training. One of the slots for coaches fell on my shop and being that all the other computer nerds were horrible shots, I was the only natural choice. So I tacked on an additional occupational specialty. Eventually I would also have under my belt proficiency with a number of weapons systems, not to mention the ability also be communicating in Arabic. All this to say, for all the jokes one has heard about the oxymoron of "military intelligence", the military, and not just myself, are forced to be adaptable to compensate for overwhelming shortcomings in the reality of resources.
Consider the veteran's history of technological understanding and consider what it means about their ability to mold themselves to changing technological environments, such as your company may face. Today's military uses the cutting edge technology to maintain our dominance over the enemy in the battlefield. From communications technology to the security of computer networks and hardware, Service Members must stay aware of emerging technologies in the public and private sector. This means that the individual service member is always training and adapting their methodology to stay ahead and insure the greatest level of technological superiority of any fighting force. Add in to this the fact that their main job may not be their only job. The Squadron's First Sergeant may also be the Communications Chief. The training NCO may also be a heavy equipment operator. The A-gunner may also be the one trained in triage medicine. They aren't just adaptable because it looks good on a resume; in the military it is a necessity.
Besides needing to adapt to changing technology, they also must adapt to changing teams. Diversity and strong interpersonal skills are another given. That doesn't necessarily mean that a Service member is a pleasant person to be around, but they have interpersonal skills that allow them to work with new and constantly evolving teams. They have learned to work side by side with individuals regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds, economic status, and geographic origins as well as those of different mental, physical and attitudinal capabilities. Consider also, that none of us have every had the privilege of choosing who we work for, who we work with, or even who gets assigned to us. Imagine how successful your teams would be if you couldn't even control who you hired. Hired? It's almost impossible to get someone fired from the military, so imagine now your company without these to abilities. Now consider what kind of leadership makes it possible. Many Service members may also have also been deployed or stationed in numerous foreign countries that give them a greater appreciation for the diverse nature of our globalized economy. Many of those, like myself, had to also deal directly those in the foreign nations we worked. You really can't find that sort of malleability in many places.
The hands on experience with technology and experiences with extreme diversity combine to give military vets one additional advantage that comes with the collision of these two experiences: A Global Mindset. Few people are knowledgeable of more than one realm of what makes the world tick. Fewer still, have first hand experience with these divergent metrics. Those who do have a unique grasp of geopolitics to the point that they can much more accurately see where the roads lead in their given focus, or at least have developed an eye for it. They look forward much more than those who look at the now. They have practice seeing how technology and culture interact because they have lived it. They care about what is going on in the world because they have been part of writing the history books. I'm not saying that your average Marine could predict how a new innovation in heat exchangers might fundamentally alter the social fabric of South East Asia. What I am saying is that if your business needs someone who is capable of learning a great deal about changing technologies or working internationally, or someone who has spent time thinking about the future of these realms, a military veteran might be a good choice for you to start your search.
Esprit de Corps; a culture built for mission accomplishment.
There is a French term that most Americans have never heard of. It's called Esprit de Corps. Literally translated, it means, "the spirit of the group". What it means is that there is a feeling in the culture of any collection of individuals that is affected by each one and that each is responsible for maintaining. Everyone in the organization comes into it each knowing the high expectations, history, heroes, and legends of the group. Each wishes to uphold the group's traditions and each wishes not damage the reputation or morale of such an organization. They are motivated by one another and try harder not to let other members of the group down. When a culture such as this exists it's expected average level of performance is above the normal for others like it. The normal is inferior and, when everyone is on board, you have an outstanding organization. You have a place where others will sacrifice their own time and resources to raise others. Esprit de Corps is the force that drives culture.
The Marines have a saying. The Marine Corps is a perfect organization made up of imperfect people. That is the level of respect each individual Marine has for their organization and when you have that level of fanaticism, you start to see each of them drive each other that much harder. If you're that hiring manager, probably work for an imperfect organization and you surely know some imperfect people that work their. Vets aren't perfect, by any means. I'm not saying they are, but they have experienced powerful cultures. Culture is what drives a company, far more so than leaders. Leaders will fail. They will grow and leave. They will become sick. They will make mistakes. They will die. Culture will never stop working for you. That is, it will never stop working for you, or working against you. What you need to do is get people who have experienced a strong working culture, maybe even a few who can lead that culture and get it spread around. It's only when a team, or even a whole company works to the point that the individuals work for reasons other than themselves, for more than themselves, that you see explosive growth. More than that, it's how you ensure long-term organizational success, regardless of leadership, regardless of temporary slumps in the economy, regardless of any storms which the company endures.
In summary, vets are a special breed. They have all the mentalities that good companies want. Tenacity, intuition, reliability, capability, responsibility, leadership and are part of a culture built on getting the job done. They are smart and they are serious. Seriously, why are all of our vets having such a hard time finding jobs? Perhaps it's you.
The truth is, and this is why I write so much about fellow vets, many of us are having a hard time. Many civilians don't understand us. People who have served are an enigma for many. They exist in contrast to many American values; an individualist society which champions personal expression, civil liberties, and personal financial, career, and political achievement, but that is built upon the presence of a class of warriors who, themselves enjoy little privilege to express themselves, have forgone many liberties, and have delayed their opportunities for the forms of achievement which society celebrates. In its extreme, we are society which cherishes our freedoms, luxuries, and security, but require, from time-to-time, volunteers who willingly sacrifice themselves in the greatest way imaginable. It's a contradiction that I don't think many have truly explored.
What's more, the sheer presence of a veteran is becoming a rarer and rarer thing. Consider many years ago when our parents would tell stories about their fathers who fought in WWII in the Pacific, or their grandfather who battled in Europe. Those were truly different times. According the United States Census Bureau, the number of U.S. armed forces personnel who served in World War II between Dec. 1, 1941, and Dec. 31, 1946 was around 16 million people. For the period since 9/11, the number of US Service members is around 10 million with around 2.5 million actually having served either in Iraq or Afghanistan. These statistics sound comparable until you think about the fact that the War on Terror has gone on for more than twice, nearly three times as long as World War II for the Americans. The 1940 US census calculated a total population of 132,164,569 citizens. Today that number is estimated to be more than 312,000,000. That means that the odds of you running into, or even being a veteran in 1945 was around 12%. Nearly 1 in every 8 people was a veteran. Given also that at that time the entire population was also directed toward the war effort, it's reasonable to say that there was no one without an understanding of the military and a passion for caring for the returning war fighter. Today, however, the story is different. Considering all living veterans today, of any period, you will find a veteran population of about 22 million, that's roughly 7% of the total population of the United States and only 3% having served since 9/11. You also don't see a culture that is wired around service towards ending the war effort. Few work for the defense industry or toward any activity that has a real involvement in the wars.  War bonds also aren't a thing. No one ever planted victory gardens in hopes of bringing home the troops. No one is recycling bacon grease or rationing gasoline in hopes that it will help us fight the terrorists. Realistically, nothing has changed much for the average American that one could really say relates to military activities. In truth it's an afterthought or a political stance. Many citizens have opinions, but few have ownership. The truth of the matter, people who have any active role, veterans in particular, are getting rarer and rarer. One the one hand, it's a sign of a peaceful society with few actual problems. One the other hand, its the pattern of a culture that has lost touch with the warrior subculture which shoulders the burden of American security without experiencing many of the rewards of it. This is a pattern which will continue in the future. By 2050, expect that the entire US veteran community will be less than 3% of the total population. Imagine, if you will, what this will mean for veteran benefits in the ballot boxes of the future when they are an even smaller minority of the voting population than they are today.
Frankly, people don't associate with veterans that often. It isn't often an intentional discrimination. It's just much rare to find one than you think, as I have shown. Their rarity today is something of a novelty, owing a degree of admiration, a great deal of curiosity, often suspicion and fear, a few times disdain, but otherwise ignored because they are so severely misunderstood. This misunderstanding, in my opinion, comes from that break where no one really knows veterans. When people don't really have any first hand experience with a veteran they fall back on stereotypes. There are many stereotypes which define us. Many of these I focused on because they are positive and help further the image of the United States warrior who has left the service. The truth is, no one perfectly captures all positive qualities of military service, but for the most part, there are so many good qualities which have been imbued into the character of a veteran of the United States. Many, if not most of qualities we have in common, are fundamental assets to employers. The pledge to support veterans is so strong that, for more than a decade thousands of companies have joined in numerous campaigns to hire veterans.
Yet you still aren't hiring us. I wrote this post, if not just to show those individuals with hiring capacity  some of the benefits that come attached to hiring veterans, but to address the fact that, in spite of so many companies' very public advertising toward campaigns supporting returning troops, vets aren't being hired.
Since the slump in 2009 and the massive unemployment that followed, veterans have led in unemployment for reasons I can only guess. I assume much of it is based on unfair biases I have faced since getting out myself. I've often heard things like, "You're so articulate for veteran" or "I don't know, I just sort of expected you be, like, crazy hard core or something." Many people asked if I had been shot at, or even killed someone. I've also been asked in interviews if I had ever been in combat, which I don't know someone at Chase's local bank branch would need to know for a standard sales position, and some have even asked if I have ever had an actual job before. I'm not sure what an actual job constitutes for most people many of the people I interviewed for after college. I guess my experiences running a telecommunications service team of 11 technicians and responsible for more than $3 million dollars in gear and equipment for what amounted to a four hundred person company didn't count as an actual job. In college I even had to correct a professor who threw out the old joke when asked what an oxymoron was. She replied, "Military Intelligence" to the laughter of a roomful of 19 year olds still living in their childhood homes. To say "corrected" is probably not the appropriate term, but everyone in the room knew better than to make such an unfair generalization again .
"Ma'am, are you aware of what it takes to re-calculate the trajectory of an object traveling at 3,110 ft/s for a three inch change in elevation at 5 times the length of a standard football field when factoring in for wind speed and direction as well as differences in elevation?" (Marine recruits do in week six of their basic training.)
Perhaps people do view that, because one forgoes college as a means to seek higher education, they are uneducated, or lack higher order cognitive processes. Perhaps media portrayal in movies, video games, and TV has simply just watered us down to two conflicting views as either a brave knight running off to do justice and make sacrifice, or of the radical bloodthirsty and murderous barbarian, too stupid to know when they are being used, both of which are completely unfit for the corporate world. Perhaps, as USA today back April of last year, followed by Forbes, have reported, there is more going on.
Many, apparently as many as one in three, employers consider the possibility of post-traumatic stress disorder to be an impediment to hiring a veteran, according to a survey report by the Society for Human Resource Management. Since it is illegal to ask about mental health status during an interview many just take the safe route and assume there is a problem. Considering that as low as  7% of post-9/11 veterans are estimated to be experiencing PTSD it's a far cry from a necessary precaution. I've read that some of the reasons for this fear are that there is a fear of safety, owing to the fear that a veteran with PTSD might "go postal" and commit an office shooting or other acts of violence. I'm just going to be honest, this is as ignorant as not hiring a black guy because he was probably in a gang.
"There's stigma attached to PTSD and traumatic brain injury and other hidden disabilities that people may assume soldiers have when they're leaving the military," says Nancy B. Adams, branch chief at the U.S. Army Warrior Transition Command. "They may always have that at the back of their mind."
Others consider that in the military, everyone is conditioned to follow orders and lack the ability to think for themselves. I hope I've shown this to be a major fallacy as service people are regularly given complex problems with limited resources where their creative thinking and ability to solve unusual problems are showcased. Sadly, the effectiveness of a Marine Corps logistics chief saving her squadron more than three million dollars over the course of a fiscal year, rarely makes the local news real when much more sensationalized media is available.
Lastly, there is the fact that you probably have no idea what a tactical data network specialist is or the qualifications and capabilities of Platoon Sergeant. What is the difference between a Major and Chief Petty Officer? Are they the same? Does it matter? What's a DD-214? It's all foreign jargon and no one knows what any of this nonsense means. There are even classes that transitioning veterans must take to communicate their value to hiring managers who don't know how to read the résumé. I don't really blame civilians for this. It isn't really anyone's fault, but just owes to the fact that there are realistically so very few veterans out there, relative to the number of people who know anything about them. That said, the best way to solve this problem might not be for you to learn what all the military lingo is. Perhaps the best thing to do is ask someone on your staff with military experience to decode it and see what kind of diamond lies beneath the rough of a sheet of paper which will determine their fate. Don't have any veterans on staff to help you out with this? Oh... Well thank you for your service. You should probably think about this Veterans Day.
So the next time Veterans Day rolls around, I hope you don't just give the ceremonial greeting, "Thank you for your service." Do something for them that they can't do for themselves. Give a résumé or application that runs over your desk a second look, or a third. There is nothing sadder in the world we live in today than seeing someone who gave up four years of their lives of their life for the reward of a handshake and a pat on the back by people who don't honestly respect them enough to want to work with them.
Don't worry about me. I'm proud to say that after many employment struggles trying to get noticed after college, I am happily employed doing something I love where I can feel my experience is valued and crucial to the work I am doing. In my spare time, I am fortunate enough to get also get to write and share my experiences and assistance for other veterans for free thanks to patronage from the crowdsourcing platform Patreon . It let's followers and supporters donate to on a recurring basis so that I can continue helping get the good word out about veterans.

The last section I was going to write about in this series was "Triumph over adversity." I'm not going to write that section though. We all know that the military is made of winners. They haven't lost a battle since Korea. Wars may be lost incorrect politics, but that failure isn't owed to those who fought them. We all know that the military makes people who are capable of overcoming adversity, but once they get out, they are alone. Their adversity is now and the military doesn't prepare them for a society that doesn't understand them, nor value their abilities. They are without the collective network of support one receives in the military. Now they are in the realm where they are judged based, not on their actions, but on current politics and media perception. Frankly, they don't need your thanks. They need your support. They need your connections. They need to be introduced into your networks. They need to be invited to the opportunities extended to others. They need you to give them a job.

Watch the historic Rosetta comet landing live  starting nowAfter 10 years of hard work, the Rosetta mission made history by landing on the surface of a comet. The lander Philae touched down on the surface of a comet more than 300 million miles away. (European Space Agency)
UPDATE: AT 11:03 AM, SUCCESSFUL LANDING WAS CONFIRMED.
For the next 24 hours or so, you can bite your nails right along with scientists from the European Space Agency and NASA as they attempt to drop a robotic probe onto a comet for the first time ever. You can read more about the mission here .
[Updated: Landing details]
The video above will stream live from mission control in Germany until 2 p.m. Wednesday. There's a viewing schedule on the ESA's Web site, subject to change of course . The team has already sailed through the first go/no-go decision point, but there are several left before the planned landing. Between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday night, two more decisions will take place.
Here are Wednesday's highlights:
1:00 a.m. Eastern time -- The team will make their final go/no-go decision, leading to final preparations for the separation of the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae lander .
4:03 a.m. Eastern time -- The scheduled separation.
7 a.m. Eastern time -- The first pictures from Philae are expected at this time. Mission control should also give an update on the data it's collecting during its descent.
9 a.m. Eastern time -- Mission control will undertake the final preparations for the landing, and much nail-biting will commence.
11 a.m. Eastern time (plus or minus 15 minutes) -- With any luck, the probe will land (hopefully upright) on the comet.
12 p.m. Eastern time (at the earliest) -- Mission control will present the first panoramic image taken of the comet, assuming Philae has landed successfully.

O Hare rated worst U.S. airport during winterO'Hare rated worst U.S. airport during winter
Anthony Souffle, Chicago Tribune
By Gregory Karp , Chicago Tribune contact the reporter
42 percent of O'Hare winter flights delayed
Chicago O'Hare is the worst airport in America for winter travelers who want to be on time and avoid crowds, according to a new report released Tuesday.
Some 42 percent of flights are delayed at O'Hare during the winter, according to flight data site Hopper, which ranked America's 20 largest airports.
O'Hare joins airports in Newark, N.J.; Denver and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., as those that have more than one-third of flights delayed during winter months.
United Airlines intends to supersize its rides at O'Hare and create multiple rush hours during the day — moves it says will benefit passengers and make the airline more money at the same time. ( Gregory Karp )
The finding about O'Hare is perhaps not surprising, given how busy it is, the winter weather climate in Chicago and its recent track record with on-time departures.
In September, the month for which the most recent data is available, O'Hare departures were on time just 70.8 percent of the time, compared with 82.5 percent for all large U.S. airports, according to federal data. Although September results were affected by a sabotaged air traffic control center that led to delays late in the month, O'Hare in most months ranks near the bottom of 29 big airports that report to the Department of Transportation.
At least we have the new runways to cut down on the delays!

THE BIGGER  THE PRICIEROld Navy is in hot water over allegations that it charges extra for women's plus-size clothing, but not for men's . Now, the company is explaining what's behind the double standard.
A petition on Change.org that has gathered over 16,000 signatures states that Old Navy charges $12-$15 more for plus-sized women's jeans than for "regular" sizes, but does not do the same for men's plus-sized jeans. The petition was first reported on by BuzzFeed.
It's not uncommon for a company to charge more for plus-size clothes. In the past, companies have justified higher prices for larger clothing items by saying the extra fabric costs manufacturers more. But this wouldn't explain the disparity in Old Navy's pricing of plus-sized clothing for different genders.
A spokeswoman for Gap, which owns Old Navy, said that women's plus-sized clothing costs more because it has special features that men's apparel doesn't.
"Old Navy is proud to offer styles and apparel designed specifically for our plus-size female customer, which includes curve-enhancing and curve-flattering elements such as four-way stretch materials and contoured waistbands, which most men's garments do not include," Gap spokesperson Debbie Felix told The Huffington Post in an email Tuesday.
"This higher price point reflects this selection of unique fabrics and design elements," she added. (Gap spokeswoman Liz Nunan gave an identical statement to BuzzFeed).
"This overtly discriminatory pricing policy indicates sexism and sizeism on the part of Old Navy that is unfair to women of size and unacceptable to me as a consumer of Old Navy's products," the Change.org petition says.
A look at Old Navy's website confirms that the company charges plus-size women more for the same item than the "regular" size, at least some of the time.
But for men, a pair of "Men's Premium Slim-Straight Jeans" is the same price whether or not you purchase the plus size.

Chhattisgarh:  Rusty  equipment used in sterilisation camp  toll 13The number of women who died after operations performed by a doctor accused of using rusty equipment at a mass sterilisation camp in Chhattisgarh rose to 13 on Wednesday, highlighting the dangers of the world's largest surgical contraception programme.
Eight women died after botched sterilisation surgery at Bilaspur district in Chhattisgarh. (Shutterstock)
The women, among more than 80 to undergo surgery, fell ill at a family planning camp at a village in Chhattisgarh on Saturday. Such camps are held regularly as part of a long-running effort to control its booming population.
The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly because of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines.
"Preliminary reports show that the medicines administered were spurious and also the equipment used was rusted," senior local government official Siddharth Komal Singh Pardeshi told Reuters.
The incident is an embarrassment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party rules in Chhattisgarh. He has vowed to reform India's health system. Modi expressed concern over the tragedy on Tuesday.
The doctor, RK Gupta, had been accused of operating on more than 80 women in just a few hours with the help of two assistants in an abandoned private hospital, officials said, contravening government guidelines to limit such operations to 30 a day.
The local government on Wednesday registered with the police a case of causing death by negligence against Gupta. Local media said Gupta blamed medicine the women had been later given and denied making any mistakes. He could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.
A tubectomy procedure is considered major surgery but doctors often exceed daily limits. Before guidelines were set there were reports doctors carried out as many as 200 surgeries a day, said Suneeta Mittal, head of gynaecology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute near New Delhi.
All the women have been hospitalised for observation and 20 are in critical condition, with many not responding to treatment, doctors said.
India carries out more female sterilisations than any other country. Sterilisation is the most popular form of birth control and the government provides cash and other incentives to encourage men and women to undergo the operation.
Winter is known in some quarters as "sterilisation season" when the weather is cool, reducing the risk of infection, and state governments rush to meet targets before the end of the financial year in March.
A team of doctors had arrived in the district of Bilaspur from New Delhi to investigate what went wrong.
Workers from the Congress party in Chhattisgarh have called for a state-wide strike.

While Black Friday may be a couple of weeks away, several companies are getting a jump on the holiday shopping season releasing their planned deals now. On Tuesday both Target and Best Buy joined the fray, releasing their full Black Friday catalog on their respective websites.
As with holiday seasons past, electronics are a big feature in Black Friday sales. Both retailers are planning deep discounts on TVs, with Best Buy offering a 50-inch Panasonic LED HDTV for just $199.99 and Target charging $219.99 for a 39-inch Vizio LED HDTV, $130 off its usual price. As with other major deals, these two are "doorbusters" and are in-store only.
Both stores are also offering deep discounts on Beats headphones, Fitbit fitness trackers, iPads, including the new iPad Air 2, and individual Blu-rays and video games. The two retail giants will also be selling a PlayStation 4 bundled with Grand Theft Auto 5 and The Last of Us for $399.99.

In addition to the Panasonic TV deal, Best Buy has a few other notable deals including an 11.6-inch MacBook Air with 128 GB of storage for $779.99 ($120 off its usual price), a 4 GB Amazon Kindle for $49.99 ($30 off, though this is not the latest Kindle Voyage), and $100-$150 off of Microsoft Surface Pro 3s with at least 128 GB of storage.
While there is still some time before these deals go into effect, both Target and Best Buy have made their full catalogs available for your scouting on their respective sites. The stores will also be following the recent trend of opening Thanksgiving night, with Best Buy opening its doors at 5 PM local time and Target following at 6 PM local time. Best Buy however will close its stores at 1 AM local time to prepare for a reopening at 8 AM on Black Friday itself. It has also said that it will be doing separate "doorbusters" during each opening.

Retail investors should get discount in IPOs...Aai
(Most of the companies give…)
NEW DELHI: Government should give discounts to retail investors when it lists state-owned entities like the Airports Authority of India and helicopter operator Pawan Hans, BSE chief Ashish Chauhan said.
The move will help increase participation of retail investors, providing momentum to the primary market.
"The government should give discount to retail investors whenever it comes out with the IPOs of companies like AAI and Pawan Hans," Chauhan told PTI.
Apart from that, he said government should also give discount to retail investors in the OFS (Offer for Sale) and follow-on public offer (FPO) of state-owned companies.
Most of the companies give a discount of up to 5 per cent on the final offer price to this group of investors.
As IPOs come via the book building process, 35 per cent of the net offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).
Further, up to 15 per cent is meant for High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) or corporates who bid for more than Rs 2 lakh. The rest, 50 per cent, is reserved for retail or individual investors who invest up to Rs 2 lakh.
Proposals for listing of AAI and Pawan Hans have been made in the Draft Civil Aviation Policy. Besides, government is planning to divest 10 per cent of its stake in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd . It has already filed draft papers with the market regulator Sebi for the public offer.
AAI, a 'Miniratna' Public Sector Enterprise, manages 125 airports across the country, including 11 International, 81 domestic and eight Customs Airports. It also manages 25 Civil Enclaves at Defence Airfields.
Pawan Hans Ltd was incorporated in 1985. Government holds 51 per cent stake in it, while 49 per cent is with state-run ONGC .

Adoor Gopalakrishnan: Film festival delegate passes only for those who knowEnglishAdoor says delegates should be adequately educated to understand world films screened with sub-titles in English
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: November 12, 2014 6:22 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 3:20 pm
Ace filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan said delegates of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) should know English to understand films with subtitles in English.
The 19th edition of IIFK is slated for next month and huge response of delegates has been a major highlight of the film festival in Kerala.
The IFFK advisory committee, headed by Gopalakrishnan, has introduced a screening method for selecting delegates, who would be issued theatre passes during the festival.
The application form for delegate pass has sought details about applicant’s education, history of attending festivals, and applicant’s favourite director and film.
Addressing the media, Adoor Gopalakrishnan said it is wrong practice that anyone with a delegate pass can view films. “While eligible persons are waiting outside the theatres, ineligible ones storm into the halls expecting some hot scenes. That practice has to be changed. Delegates should be adequately educated to understand world films screened with sub-titles in English,” he said.

European spacecraft begins descending tocometEuropean Space Agency said Wednesday that the landing craft separated from Rosetta probe for descent to comet 67P. (Source: AP photo)

The European Space Agency’s unmanned Rosetta probe successfully released a lander toward the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Wednesday, putting it on its final seven-hour journey to a historic rendezvous with the fast-moving lump of dust and ice.
The audacious landing attempt is the climax of a decade-long mission to study the 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) wide comet, which is traveling at 41,000 mph (66,000 kph). It is also the end of a 6.4 billion-kilometer (4 billion-mile) journey on which Rosetta carried its sidekick lander Philae piggyback.
“It’s on its own now,” said Stephan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager at the DLR German Aerospace Center. He said that “we’ll need some luck not to land on a boulder or a steep slope.”
The picture taken with the navigation camera on Rosetta and released by ESA shows the boulder-strewn neck region of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. It was captured from a distance of 9.7 km from the center of the comet (about 7.7 km / 4.8 miles. (Source: AP photo)
If successful, it will be the first time that a spacecraft has landed on a comet. Confirmation of a landing should reach Earth by about 1603 GMT (11:03 a.m. EST).
ESA announced early Wednesday that the 100-kilogram (220-pound) lander’s active descent system, which uses thrust to prevent the craft from bouncing off the comet’s surface, could not be activated. Instead, the agency is relying on ice screws and a harpoon system to secure the lander.

Hours later, mission controllers clapped and embraced as the lander’s separation was confirmed.
`Philae has gone _ it’s on its path down to the comet,” Rosetta flight director Andrea Accomazzo said. “We are all glad that it worked flawlessly in the past minutes.”
About two hours after the separation was confirmed, scientists said they had re-established contact with the lander, as expected. “Now we can follow it on its descent,” said Paolo Ferri, head of mission operations at ESA.
 
The washing machine-sized lander is supposed to drift down to the comet and latch on using harpoons and screws. During the descent, scientists are continued…

Only a Muslim can be J-K CM: PDP leaderA People's Democratic Party (PDP) legislator has stoked a controversy by saying that only a Muslim can become the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, a view from which his party quickly distanced itself.
 
"There are certain parties which are trying to forge an alliance with communal elements and want to impose Hindu chief minister here (in Kashmir). But let me make it clear that Jammu and Kashmir is a Muslim-majority state and can be ruled by a Muslim chief minister only," Peerzada Mansoor, MLA from Shangus, said at a workers convention in Anantnag district in the poll-bound state on Tuesday.
 
The PDP legislator said installation of a Hindu chief minister will prove to be detrimental for the political resolution of Kashmir issue.
 
"Kashmir is a sensitive place and a conflict zone. So, if a Hindu chief minister is installed, it would have a bearing on its political landscape and other issues may crop up," he added.
 
The PDP, however, said it was an individual leader's response to constant posturing by the BJP and the Congress on the issue.
 
"Some Congress and BJP leaders have been raking up the issue of having a Hindu chief minister in the state. So this was a reaction to that.
 
"PDP does not believe that religion is the deciding factor while electing a chief minister. It is the merit and popularity of the candidate that decide it," party's chief spokesperson Naeem Akhtar told PTI.
 
He said the PDP and people of Jammu and Kashmir need no certificate for their secular credentials as they have proved it time and again.
 
"People of Kashmir have been electing Pandit MLAs while Mufti Mohammad Sayeed (PDP Patron) was elected from RS Pura. We are a secular state," he added.

NMDC-led consortium may buy stake in Russian potash co
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 12:  
State-run NMDC-led consortium is planning to buy 30 per cent stake in the Russian potash firm Acron, which may result in an investment of around Rs 1,000 crore.
Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF), National Fertilizers Ltd (NFL), Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd (FACT) and fertiliser cooperative Kribhco are the four other entities which are part of this consortium.
Along with purchasing 30 per cent stake, the consortium is also looking to enter into an off take agreement for import of Potash from the Russian firm, a top official of NMDC told PTI.
At present, National Mines Development Corporation (NMDC) is conducting a feasibility study at a cost of Rs 2 crore on this proposal, the official added. The official also said that buying a 30 per cent stake in Acron would cost something around Rs 1,000 crore.
When contacted a senior official in the government confirmed the development and said that final decision would be taken after the final report of feasibility study, and added, “if proposal turned out to be feasible an agreement may be signed during the visit of Russian President to the country this year.”
India imports 100 per cent of its requirement of potash, which was about 3 million tonnes (MT) in 2013-14. In 2013-14, potash was imported at average price of $390 per tonne. In the current fiscal so far the country has imported 2.7 MT of potash at an average price of about $330 per tonne. Indian Potash Ltd is one of the major importers of potash while Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers.
Potash is a decontrolled fertiliser and government pays fixed subsidy on it. It is mainly used in the form of Muriate of Potash (MoP) by farmer as soil nutrient and also used in the manufacturing of complex NPK fertilisers.

A month after Hudhud mayhem  Vizag gets back into strideA month after Hudhud mayhem, Vizag gets back into stride

A month after Hudhud: Fishermen repairing their boats at the Fishing Harbour in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday. - Photo: C.V. Subrahmanyam
Visakhapatnam, Nov 12:  
It was on Oct. 12, exactly a month ago as on Wednesday that the cyclone Hudhud hit the city with a fury never imagined before and left it gasping for breath. The city has regained normalcy to a great extent, even though the scars are very much visible on the landscape, with most of the greenery gone, and the three crucial sectors - industry, tourism and fisheries - suffering both short-term and long-term losses.
The damage is yet to be assessed in its totality, and a nine-member central team is visiting the city from Nov. 25 to Nov. 27 for the purpose. The industry and the fisheries sectors are getting back on their feet. The major units such as the Visakhapatnam steel plant, the HPCL refinery, the Hindusthan Shipyard and others have resumed production and the smaller units are also on the same path. The Visakhapatnam port has resumed cargo-handling normally, in spite of long-term damage to some of its structures such as the break-water, and the private Gangavaram port has also revived operations even though it has also taken a hit.
The cyclone has shaken the public of the port city and also woken the authorities to the necessity for using modern technology such as underground cables for power transmission to make it more cyclone-proof. "The cyclone has hit the city after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an announcement in the USA that Vizag will be one of the three smart cities in the country to get US aid. Now it is for the State and Union Goverments to take long-term steps to face such calamities in future and to recover much faster than it has done after Hudhud," says B. Gopi, the CEO of Sankhya Technologies, a software company.
Neeraj Sarda, the Director of Sarda Metals & Alloys Ltd., whose ferro-alloys unit in Vizianagaram district suffered substantial loss, has said that "from now on our structures should be built to withstand wind speeds well above 200 KMPH, may be in the range of 250-300 KMPH perhaps. This cyclone has set a new benchmark for structures in the city and the neighbouring districts of Vizinagaram and Srikakulam as well."
Chief Minister N. Chandra Babu Naidu has made an announcement that the city would be made more cyclone-proof in future and "there is no need to worry about its long-term prospects, as it is only a temporary setback."
Efforts are also on by the general public as well as the industry to restore the green cover of the city by taking up a massive plantation drive. Visakhapatnam steel plant Chairman and Managing Director P. Madhusudan has said that "the steel plant, the biggest industrial unit in Andhra Pradesh, will give as much importance to restoration of green cover in the plant as for its steel production."

India s retail inflation drops to 5.52 per cent in OctoberNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
India’s economic outlook brightened on Wednesday with a surprise pickup in industrial output and further cooling in consumer prices, data showed, boosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bid to end the longest slowdown in growth in decades.
Retail inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tracks in setting lending rates, slowed to 5.52 percent in October from a multi-year low of 6.46 percent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices.
Industrial output unexpectedly grew 2.5 percent year on year in September, its fastest pace in three months, helped by a rebound in the capital goods sector, separate government data showed.
Read Full Report: CPI Inflation
Wednesday’s data is expected to bolster the outlook for Asia’s third-largest economy which is recovering weakly from a two-year spell of sub-5 percent growth.
Economic growth hit a 2-1/2 year-high of 5.7 percent in the quarter to June, prompting some economists to predict 6 percent growth for the fiscal year to March 2015, higher than 5.5 percent projected by the central bank.
But lacklustre industrial production since then has led some to trim their more optimistic projections.
Read Full Report: IIP Growth
Cooling prices will intensify pressure on the RBI to cut interest rates to stimulate consumer demand which powers 60 percent of the economy.
“A rate cut at this juncture will no doubt add to the existing positive growth impulses,” said Prithviraj Srinivas, an economist with HSBC.
“But such a move would also increase the risk that the RBI misses its inflation target … to return inflation back to the level last seen in the period between 1999 and 2005, when CPI inflation averaged just 4 percent.”
Worries that price pressures would revive once food prices pick up due to a weak monsoon and the fading of base effects led the RBI to leave one of Asia’s highest lending rates on hold for a fourth straight meeting in September.
It is widely expected to maintain the status quo when it reviews monetary policy on Dec. 2.
Slowing inflation, however, has bolstered hopes for a rate cut next year, triggering a rally in the bonds market.
COMMENTARY
SOUMYA KANTI GHOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER AT STATE BANK OF INDIA, MUMBAI:
“The CPI trajectory is benign and the decline is well entrenched. I expect the next number to be below 4.5 percent.
“But we do not expect an RBI rate cut before mid-2015 as inflation will remain higher than RBI’s 6 percent target by January 2016. The IIP (industrial output) is better than expectation, but this could be a transient number and improve only in the last quarter of the current fiscal year.”
SHIVOM CHAKRABARTI, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT HDFC BANK, MUMBAI
“We see some further downside in inflation driven by base effect. There is strong indication that food price inflation and momentum of core inflation is coming off.
“But that said, trajectory of CPI inflation will only be clear after base effect wears off post-December.
“We expect a status quo on rates in the RBI policy though the statement could be more dovish than in the September policy.
“The industrial production number is high, but the worrying aspect is consumer goods, which is fairly weak. The real improvement in industrial production will be seen next year when inflation comes down, which will spur consumer spending and exports will be higher.”
RUPA REGE NITSURE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BANK OF BARODA, MUMBAI
“It is a very sweet pair of numbers, but the point is that with IIP (industrial production) one cannot look at it with a high level of credibility because it is a very, very volatile series.
“It has to do with the lumpiness in the capital goods production series. But what really matters is that all other indicators of economic activity actually have slowed in the month of October, whether it is PMI, or credit demand or auto sales. So I don’t think that today’s reading of industrial production is sustainable.
“Inflation, of course, has started moderating but recent data shows that towards the end of October we have seen spikes in vegetable prices as well as in cereal prices because of delayed monsoon. So there’s a big question of sustainability of these readings.
“I stick with my stance that at least in the current financial year there will not be any rate reduction.
R. SIVAKUMAR, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME, AXIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI
“CPI is more or less in line. Post-September we saw a cut in petrol, diesel prices. Along with the ongoing play on the base effect, both have worked on the year-on-year number.
“IIP (industrial production) is a bit above survey, but that doesn’t say much.
“It’s still a very weak reading at 2.5 percent. We had a series of decent reading leading up to the June quarter, but the subsequent quarters have clearly indicated a weak reading, which may point to a slightly low GDP number at the end of the month.”
A PRASANNA, ECONOMIST, ICICI SECURITIES PRIMARY DEALERSHIP, MUMBAI
“The CPI data is positive.
“Next number is also expected to be benign and could be below 5 percent. But base effect will kick in after that, which will push up inflation in the January-March quarter, and average inflation could be at 7 percent by financial year-end.
“As far as RBI is concerned though, inflation is likely to undershoot RBI’s 8 percent target for January 2015. There are still upside risks to the 6 percent target by January 2016 and therefore we expect rates to remain unchanged this financial year.”
SOUMYAJIT NIYOGI, ANALYST, SBI DFHI LTD, MUMBAI
“The unexpected fall in October consumer inflation will mean that the inflation number for the December quarter will likely be less than 7 percent.
“This is heartening and gives RBI scope to consider rate cuts next year. On the IIP (industrial production) front, although the rebound is reassuring, we do expect some moderation in the coming days.
“The 10-year bond has already factored in this substantial fall in inflation, so the incremental gains from hereon in government bonds will be limited. Lastly we expect RBI to cut interest rates only by February next year.”

Five Congress MLAs have been suspended after the Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao sustained injury in Legislative Assembly . The Congress MLAs  on the first day of the session on Wednesday tried to block his entry into the legislature complex here causing injury to him.
Speaking in the Assembly,Khadse said Congress legislators Rahul Bondre, Amar Kale, Ranjit Kamble, Vijay Wadettiwar and Abdul Sattar “caused injuries” to two legislature officials as well as the Governor.
Khadse said he wanted to move a resolution suspending these members for unruly behaviour.
“Governor’s left hand was injured. The issue does not end with an apology. This should not be tolerated,” Khadse said.
Congress leader in the House Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said there was no intention to cause hurt to anyone, but he would apologise.
NCP MLAs Ajit Pawar, R R Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, however, said the issue should be put to the rest with the apology if the report of Governor getting hurt was true.
Today is the first day of the new legislative Assembly and it should not start on a bitter note, the NCP leaders said.
BJP MLA Girish Mahajan said he was an eyewitness to the incident and it was a condemnable development.
Speaker Haribhau Bagde then adjourned the House for 30 minutes to discuss the issue with group leaders.

23 companies nailed earnings season23 companies nailed earnings season

Better-than-expected earnings are a big reason why stocks are soaring. But there’s a small group of stocks that absolutely nailed earnings season — many of which analysts say can still be money makers for investors.
There are 23 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500, including biotech Biogen Idec (BIIB) , Time Warner (TWX) and drug company Actavis (ACT) that dominated earnings season. These companies not only topped third-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, but also boosted their guidance for the future, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Additionally, all these companies posted adjusted third-quarter earnings that were higher than the year ago period, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.
Seeing how important earnings are to investors as the bull market ages — it’s a good idea to know which companies are crushing earnings season. With markets notching record highs, it’s less likely to expect investors to necessarily pay higher valuations with the market’s P-E already pushing beyond the average. It’ll be the companies that can drive earnings and revenue growth that can see stock price appreciation, even if P-Es are static.
And at this point, other than a few retailers due out this week, earnings season is just about wrapped up. More than 450 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their quarterly results, says S&P Capital IQ. Earnings growth from these companies is 8.9% for the quarter, which is better than some investors feared going into the season. (Keep in mind that different data providers might have slightly different earnings growth numbers.)
But stocks that investors might want to pay special attention to are the four analysts still think have 10% or higher upside before hitting their price targets. These are stocks that have it all — solid earnings momentum, growth and upside potential and include Biogen, Time Warner, Actavis and Cummins (CMI) .
Biogen is a classic example of a company that delivered everything that was expected — and then some — that still has room to move higher — according to analysts. The company on Oct. 22 reported an adjusted quarterly profit of $3.80 a share. That not only topped expectations by 10%, but was also was 62% higher than the same period a year ago. The stock slid about 5% on the first day after the announcement, Bespoke says. But at its closing price of $324.59 Tuesday, that means there’s still 17% upside before hitting analysts’ 18-month price target of $380.74, says S&P Capital IQ.
Don’t make the easy mistake, though, assuming just because a company nailed earnings season the stock must go up from here. CR Bard (BCR) , a seller of patient-care supplies, on Oct. 22 reported 28% higher adjusted profit of $1.92 a share. That topped expectations by nearly 3%. The trouble is that the stock immediately reacted, gaining 4% that day. As a result, shares are now trading for $164, which is nearly 8% past analysts’ price target.
Stock prices might be hard to judge. But for now, allow these companies to relish the fact that they nailed the quarter.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

DDA gets 10 lakh applications for housing schemeDDA receives over 10 lakh applications for 2014 housing scheme
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 17:22 IST
DDA has received over 10 lakh applications for the flagship 'Housing Scheme 2014' and it will on Monday conduct a dry run to check its preparedness for the much-awaited draw of lots.
The tentative date for holding the draw of the lots for the new scheme was November 10, but a senior official of the housing authority today said that the exact date would be decided based on the outcome of Monday's trial.
"We are going to hold a dry run on Monday to test our preparedness for conducting the draw, like the technological elements involved, so as to mitigate any contingency situations on the day of the draw. The exact date for it would be decided accordingly," the official told PTI.
The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for the first time has also planned to webcast the entire event live on YouTube, and so the run serves as a means to test everything in working conditions so as to avoid any glitches later on.
The webcast would be available for "unlimited" number of online users through the YouTube channel.
The scheme, which was launched on September 1 had seen a massive response both online and offline, leading to DDA's website getting crashed within few hours on the opening day itself.
The last date for the scheme was October 9 but the date was extended till October 15 later. Till then 7.5 lakh applications were received. The number rose to 8.5 lakh a few days later as applications from far-flung bank branches reached the DDA headquarters here late.
"The number of received applications has now crossed 10 lakh and that is pretty much the final figure, we would say. People are going online as they can check their application status on our website, where the procedure for conducting the draw has also been uploaded," she said.
The housing scheme offers over 25,000 flats across various categories, ranging from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore.
Although about 17 lakh brochures were sold through DDA counters and the branches of its various empanelled banks, officials ascribed the "lukewarm response" to the scheme to the lock-in period and the nature of flats on offer.
"The primary reason for the not-so-overwhelming response, despite selling so many brochures, could be the five-year lock -in period for the ownership of the flats, which we have introduced for the first time.
"Besides, most flats are of lower range, one-bedroom types, so that could be another factor," the official said.

Color of Money: Its time to ditch the term helicopter parent and stop being afraid of getting involvedBy Michelle Singletary November 7 Follow @SingletaryM
Michelle Singletary isn’t ashamed of being a highly involved, strict parent – the type others might (incorrectly, she says) call a “helicopter parent.” Singletary instead sees herself as a “shepherd parent,” steering her children back to the right path when they want to wander off. When it comes to helping your children succeed, she wrote in her recent electronic newsletter , “the bottom line: We can’t afford not to hover.”
In these excerpts from her weekly Color of Money live chat , Singletary, joined by Get There’s Jonnelle Marte, explains why she thinks it’s important to be a strict parent to your kids – and why we need to ditch the term “helicopter parent” for one that acknowledges the benefits of being involved. [Some questions have been edited for length and clarity.]
(AP Photo/Northwest Florida Daily, Nick Tomecek)
Q: I’ve always interpreted “helicopter parent” to mean a parent whose involvement hinders their child’s development. You gave the example of encouraging a student to apply for scholarships or internships. A helicopter parent would fill out the forms, write the essays, mail the application and call the company to follow up. This level of “help” prevents a student from developing the level of maturity and responsibility necessary to succeed in school and in a career. The student has no space to learn to fail and try again. You’re absolutely right about the importance of strict parenting, but some parents take it too far.
Michelle Singletary: Who knew I would open up such a can of concern? (Not worms.) I’m just struck at how often people tell parents to back off and let their kids fail in the name of letting them grow up. But some falls are way too hard for children who are still young. I’m thinking 18 to very early 20s. We need another name for the parent who encourages and nags their kid about internships or applying for scholarships but doesn’t do the work. I was thinking “Shepherd Parenting.”
What do others feel? Where is the line?
 Q: I guess I am the helicopter parent or strict parent. I recommended colleges, summer enrichment programs, summer jobs and volunteered my daughter for things she did not want to do. I made her stick it out when she wanted to quit. We applied to 15 colleges. Yes, we. I bought the filing box, folders, labels, SAT/ACT tests, envelopes, stamps, thank-you cards, etc., and showed her how to set everything up and organize it.
Did I write the essay? NO. But I reviewed and red-inked and checked for spelling errors. Strict parenting was showing that discipline, preparation and opportunity leads to success more often than not. Strict parenting meant loosening the reins so that she could taste independence and make her own decisions, while under my eyes.
Singletary: Nope. You are a shepherd. And you sound just like me. Especially the part about not letting her quit. I have a 14-year-old who would be a quitter if I let her. No, sir. Not in my house. You sign up for something, you honor your commitment. And I TOTALLY agree about the “we” applied for college, as it concerns my now-sophomore at the University of Maryland, College Park. It is a joint effort. Especially since WE — me and my husband — are paying!!
Q: But you don’t let your children fail? What’s going to happen when you aren’t around? Do they have the skills to handle failure? That day will come. (Ask Dr. Seuss — “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!”)
Singletary: You do have it wrong. They fail. All the time. But just like with a sheep that goes off in harm’s way, we shepherd them back to where they need to be. Some things are too big to let an 18-year-old flounder. Some things you let them see what happens when they don’t listen. Others, you pull, tug and fuss until they do the right thing.
Q: Fair enough. So at what age do you let them stand on their own two feet to live their own lives as adults, making their own decisions whether you like their choices or not?
Singletary: When they are paying ALL their bills. Until then you help, push, nudge, give unsolicited advice. Because you are still the full-time parent.
And, really, if you do it right, it does come sooner rather than later for many. I hardly have to say or do anything for my 19-year-old, who is in her second year at the University of Maryland. But just yesterday I had to fuss at her for not having a coat.
Q: I think the key with helicopter parents is whether they are operating in the foreground or the background. I provide lots of information to my two college students based on my own experiences, and also give my opinion about the options they are considering in terms of majors, classes and contacting their professors when issues come up. What I don’t do is write their papers or e-mail their professors myself or decide what they will major in. (Although I do exercise veto power on that!) That kind of behavior is excessive and harmful to the student in the long run. I work with a woman who wanted her son to apply to UMCP when he was not interested. She told him that she would write his application essay if he agreed to apply. That crosses the line. (Actually, it’s fraud.)
Jonnelle Marte: Good call! As a parent, you should provide support. But college is a time for children to learn how to manage their time and to develop a good work ethic. I would encourage them to seek internships, since work experience is as key to finding a job as the diploma is. No need to write papers, though!
Singletary: In college:
No essay writing.
No calling professors.
A lot of giving advice still and making sure they are making the most of their college experience so they can get a job so they can get out of your house. 
Q: I do like that term shepherding, and I’m sure that if it’s done with love there will be a good outcome. I’m an aunt with more than 20 nieces and nephews. I’m trying to gently move these children and young adults towards good financial choices, but sometimes it’s hard to know how much to say to them, if they don’t ask. I just wish someone had shepherded me earlier and would like to be that person for them.
Singletary: What a great auntie. I have kids, but I’m forever sticking my nose in the personal finance business of my nieces and nephews. And you know what? They groan. But later, after they take my unsolicited advice, they thank me. So push. When they scream, stop. But be the little angel on their shoulder that they don’t want to listen to but need to.
 Q: I had a “Shepherd” mom, as well. The problem was that a lot of the advice she gave me was flat-out wrong, and I spent a lot of time trying to make sound decisions against her mandates and well-intentioned advice. She meant well, but the world had changed so much between the 1960s and the 1980s. My parents didn’t know what Early Decision was, drove dangerously old cars because “car salespeople can’t be trusted,” and tried to force me to stop investing in my 401k because “the stock market is a scam.” Parents who “shepherd” their children need to stay informed to ensure that they’re not sending their “sheep” into a pack of wolves.
Singletary: Very true. Information is only power if it’s the right information. 
Q: For a long time I disagreed with your view that parents should plan to pay for college. I worked through school and believed it was character-building. Then I had a baby. We’ve begun a 529, and a trust! I can’t imagine her going through the things I did just to pay bills! I’d rather raise a spoiled child than one who experiences those choices (food versus tuition, etc.). I am always going to be the overinvolved mom, I think. So, now I see your point!
Marte: Congratulations on the baby! I recently interviewed a father of eight who lives by your old way of thinking. He says he has no college fund and wants his children to pay their own way. (Needless to say, he evoked some strong responses.) With student loans being such an issue today, you are right in starting a fund for your child early. By saving a little now, hopefully it will grow to be enough by the time your child needs it so that she won’t have to go into debt. And you can find other ways to teach her about being responsible with money.
Singletary: So, I was right! Love it. Knew I was! Look, this is often how I approach parents who thought what you thought:
1. Given your view that your child should struggle and work like a dog or go deep into debt to pay for school, THEN you would not agree that he or she should be given a scholarship, right? They look at me like I’m crazy. So I continue: Well, if you shouldn’t help pay for school, why should someone else do so? Same principal, right? That they need to suffer to get the lesson? By then the honest ones understand my point.
I get it if you don’t have the money to pay or help pay for college because life happened. But if you have savings and can pay for your kid to go to college, it’s part of your parenting job. Because that brings me to:
2. How the heck is a kid going to save what he or she needs to pay for college unless he or she is a music star or a TV star? He or she can’t. So that means he or she has to work a ton of jobs, which can affect grades, or, as many do these days, he or she will have to borrow a ton of debt. But you, dear parent, are working. You have a job. You have the ability to start saving from the time the kid is born until his or her college days. So save if you can, as much as you can.
Now, does that mean you are raising a spoiled kid if you pay for college? Not if you parent right. My husband and I are paying in cash most of what my 19-year-old needs for college. But just like a scholarship, we have requirements. She must maintain a 3.0 GPA or better. She must behave responsibly. She has to go to church regularly. Our money. Our rules. She has agreed, and we are very, very happy. She is enjoying her college years without working like a dog — even though she does have a part-time job in her field of study. (That was another rule. She could work, but it had to be a job that helped her in her field.)
Long way to say, glad you changed your mind!
Q: Another point is that school is much more expensive now than when today’s parents of college kids were in school. Tuition has increased much faster than inflation. I graduated from an Ivy League university in 1992, and my tuition was $17k/year. Doesn’t that sound like a bargain now??
Marte: College costs are skyrocketing, which partially explains the rise in debt. That makes it more important for people to find ways to reduce costs, either by choosing a less expensive school, having the child live at home or with a relative and taking advantage of other programs like work study.
Singletary: Exactly!
Q: I also don’t associate helicopter parenting with strict parenting. To me the helicopter parents are the ones who refuse to believe their kids do anything wrong, shelter them from all consequences and e-mail the grad student’s future employer to ask about the dress code (ahem, not that this has ever happened to me). Though I do have a question for the involved parents, however you want to call it. When do you stop? You are pushing your college-age child to fill out applications, okay, but when does that end? At what point does independence actually take over?
Singletary: I’m a parent for life. You stop when they are paying for everything. Grown. As they get older you do let go … but you are not gone. That’s my point. I’m one of the biggest advocates for personal responsibility. But you have to use common sense as to when you are helping and when you are enabling.

Apple iOS bug makes iPhones and iPads vulnerable to attacks by hackers: ExpertsEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Researchers have warned that a bug in Apple Inc’s iOS operating system makes most iPhones (including the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus) and iPads vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers seeking access to sensitive data and control of their devices.
Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc published details about the vulnerability on its blog on Monday, saying the bug enables hackers to access devices by persuading users to install malicious applications with tainted text messages, emails and Web links.
The malicious application can then be used to replace genuine, trusted apps that were installed through Apple’s App Store, including email and banking programs, with malicious software through a technique that FireEye has dubbed “Masque Attack.”
These attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data, according to FireEye, which is well-regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research.
“It is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to exploit,” FireEye Senior Staff Research Scientist Tao Wei said in an interview.
Apple’s iOS has robust security features that make it extremely difficult for attackers to install malware on devices using traditional techniques for infecting Windows machines and Android mobile devices with malicious emails and Web links. The “Masque Attack” makes that possible by exploiting a system that Apple developed to allow large organizations to deploy custom-built software without going through Apple’s App Store, according to David Richardson, iOS product manager at mobile security firm Lookout.
Those applications are not vetted by Apple for malicious software, unlike apps in its App Store, though users do receive pop-up notifications asking if they want to prevent the apps from installing on devices, he said.
“You can just say ‘Don’t install.’ As long as you do that, you will be protected from this vulnerability,” Richardson said.
FireEye disclosed the vulnerability to Apple in July and representatives of the company said they were working to fix the bug, according to Wei.
Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.
News of the vulnerability began to leak out in October on specialized Web forums where security experts and hackers alike discuss information on Apple bugs, Wei said.
He said FireEye decided to go public with its findings after Palo Alto Networks Inc last week uncovered WireLurker, the first campaign to exploit the vulnerability.
“Currently WireLurker is the only one, but we will see more,” Wei said.

Nkemiin Nokia  you will always be part of my memoriesBRAND CHANGE: The Nokia Lumia 530 and the Microsoft Lumia 535.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: November 11, 2014 2:04 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 11:05 am
It was 2001. My aunt had just couriered me her old Nokia 3310 because she had got herself a new Nokia. Being an underpaid journalist far away from home, I was quick to latch on to the offer. I used that old phone for two years, during which period I fell in love and got married to the woman who is now my wife.
#NokiaStory: 10 Nokia phones India will always remember
The phone, and BSNL’s night time free SMS plan, paid a huge role in our courtship. Just after marriage my wife gifted me a new Nokia 6230 with a colour screen, a big upgrade.I  still have that phone somewhere in my house and I am pretty sure that if I charge it for a couple of hours, it should be able to work like before.

But a decade later, I cannot buy a Nokia phone anymore. Nor can I buy the kind of trust associated with that Finnish brand we all called the mobile phone for many years.
Today, Nokia’s new owners Microsoft Devices announced the launch of the Lumia 535. Yes, the first Lumia phone without the Nokia branding.  No surprises here, for we had reported earlier this year that this change was in the offing. But seeing the Nokia brand fade away brings in a flood of memories.
There are very few brands that would have touched our lives as much as Nokia and there would be very few of us who haven’t used their products at least once in our lives. I am sure each one of us has a Nokia story of our own.
The Lumia 535 has a 5-inch screen, 5-megapixel front and rear cameras and 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 200 processor, but no Nokia branding anywhere. It will be the Microsoft Lumia 535. This will be the first of many Microsoft Lumia devices, and usher in the last few months where we might be able to buy a Nokia branded device. Microsoft has the license to use the Nokia brand for few more years, but it seems Redmond does not want to  become more dependent on the legacy.
There are reports that, once the Microsoft license is over, Nokia will return, maybe with even an Android phone.
But till then, it is Goodbye Nokia. Or should we say näkemiin Nokia?

John Farneda bows out as  heart and soul  of WXRTJohn Farneda bows out as ‘heart and soul’ of ’XRT

John Farneda
John Farneda, who joined WXRT FM 93.1 as an intern in 1983 and rose to operations manager and music director, is retiring from the CBS Radio album adult alternative station.
“After 31 years at Chicago’s Finest Rock, I realized that I have achieved all my goals at the radio station and it is now time to set new ones,” Farneda, 53, told colleagues Tuesday. His last day on the job will be November 26.
Calling WXRT “one of the most respected, unique and influential radio stations in the country,” Farneda added: “I look forward to exploring new adventures in the music industry. I hope to share my decades of programming experience with friends wanting to innovate and entertain. In the meantime, I’m going to enjoy some well deserved time off by traveling and spending more time with friends and loved ones.”
Norm Winer, vice president of adult rock programming for CBS Radio and program director of WXRT, called Farneda the “heart and soul” of the station, citing “the warmth, sensitivity and thoughtfulness that John conveyed to everyone with whom he interacted.”
A Chicago native and graduate of Columbia College (where Terri Hemmert was among his teachers), Farneda turned his internship into a job as Hemmert’s morning show producer. Over the years, he served as assistant program director, music director, and since 2004, operations manager, which included overseeing day-to-day programming.
Rod Zimmerman, senior vice president and market manager of CBS Radio Chicago, said Farneda’s position would be filled.
Here is the text of Winer’s memo to the staff:
After almost 35 years of being the only person I have ever called the “heart and soul” of WXRT, our comrade, friend and colleague John Farneda has informed us of his intention to retire from his position of Music Director and Operations Manager.
John’s career at WXRT began as morning show producer for Terri Hemmert, which led to his role as Assistant Music Director, then Music Director and subsequently Operations Manager. But among his most significant ongoing contributions is the warmth, sensitivity and thoughtfulness that John conveyed to everyone with whom he interacted. His professionalism and sense of responsibility to the station and his colleagues were among his most admirable qualities. He was recognized for his expertise on a number of occasions, having been named Music Director of the Year and being among the most beloved and respected figures in our format.
John’s final day at the station will be November 26.
I consider myself very lucky to have worked by his side for so many years. I know that he’ll now be able to enjoy himself considerably more as he distances himself from his desk. It’s time for John to get back to his passion of seeing the world.
Safe travels, Giovanni – and Godspeed from all of us!

Woman charged in alleged fake McDonald s coffee burn caseWoman charged in alleged fake McDonald's coffee burn case
McDonald's Customer Arrested In 'Bogus' Coffee Burn Photos
 
A Victorville woman is charged with 21 felony counts after claiming to be being burned by McDonald's coffee
California insurance commissioner says every year tens of thousands of possible fraud cases referred to him
The woman claimed that an unsecured lid caused steaming hot McDonald’s coffee to spill on her right hand, severely burning it. As evidence, Selena Edwards, 38, of Victorville provided pictures of second-degree burns.
8
But the only burns Edwards may suffer from are the prosecutorial ones she now faces for allegedly faking her injuries.
State insurance officials say the woman’s claims were a bid to extract $10,000 from McDonald’s Corp. The photos and medical documents Edwards provided to bolster her case came from the Internet, they said. 
McDonald's is offering free coffee again in an effort to boost its flagging U.S. sales and gain momentum in a fierce battle for breakfast customers. ( Shan Li )
“We discovered that some of the photos were from a hospital website,” state Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said. “We contacted her medical provider and discovered she hadn’t received any medical treatment.”
The San Bernardino County district attorney charged Edwards with 21 felony counts of insurance fraud and workers' compensation fraud.
A district attorney spokesman could not be reached for comment.
Finger in your chili? Rat in your coffee? People try this stuff every day. They end up in prison, deservedly. Trying to game the legal system for fun and profit isn't a way to get ahead in life.

Authorities said Edwards looked to the golden arches in Fontana on Jan. 28, 2013, to allegedly commit the crime. Officials said the Victorville woman claimed coffee had spilled on her right hand when she was handed a cup with an unsecured lid at the McDonald’s drive-through.
Jones said the insurance company became suspicious of Edwards’ claims and referred the case to state investigators, who launched a probe.
“By copying legitimate burn photos from the Internet, Edwards attempted to make a profit from another person’s pain and suffering and for this she will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” he said.
The prosecution of Edwards comes 20 years after a jury awarded $2.9 million to a 79-year-old woman who was badly burned after hot coffee spilled into her lap at a McDonald’s in Albuquerque. The 1994 verdict attracted international attention, was mocked by radio and television talk-show hosts and was even used as a plot point in the TV comedy “Seinfeld.”
Despite the controversy, the woman in that case, Stella Liebeck, actually did suffer severe third-degree burns and required skin graft surgery.
In January, a woman filed a lawsuit against McDonald’s, saying she was burned when coffee spilled on her at one of the fast-food chain’s Los Angeles restaurants. Paulette Carr claimed she was burned on January 2012 because the lid on her cup was not properly secured. The lawsuit did not describe the severity of Carr’s injuries.
The merit of those cases aside, Jones said that every year tens of thousands of cases that potentially involve fraud are referred to his agency.
In the last 11 months there have been 26,415 cases, about 1,549 of which remain open, officials say.

40 business to close when Matteson's Lincoln Mall shuts its doors after the holidays
After legal fight with the village of Matteson over maintaining the building, Lincoln Mall is closing
A Cook County judge issued an order this week that will force the Lincoln Mall shopping center in south suburban Matteson to close after the Christmas holiday shopping season.
Judge Thomas Condon of the Circuit Court in Markham issued the order late Monday that says the mall will close for business as of Jan. 7 with the exception of the Carson Pirie Scott store. That store will remain open.

The mall's fate has been the subject of a lawsuit brought by Matteson village officials to force the mall's owner, New York real estate developer Michael Kohan, to maintain the structure. A court-ordered receiver, Chicago-based Collateral Trustee, was appointed in August 2013, but attorneys for Kohan were unable to provide money to enable the receiver to make adequate repairs.
Village President Andre Ashmore said he wishes the shopping mall — which dates back to 1973 and has capacity for four major anchor stores and 100 smaller shops inside — could have been maintained.

"As a village, we have done all that we can to keep Lincoln Mall open," Ashmore said in a statement. "We understand Judge Condon's decision, but this is incredibly disappointing for the local residents who make their livelihood at that mall."
Benjamin Peacock, owner of the 3 Circles School of Karate, said he understands the financial problems that are causing the mall to close. But he wishes village officials could have waited until next spring or summer to act.
"Closing in the winter like this, that is going to put more of a burden on us," Peacock said, adding that the 183 people who work in the mall's businesses also will be hurt.
"These people have mortgages to pay, they need to earn a living," he said. "Now they're going to be out of work."
Ashmore said village officials want to help the 40 businesses remaining in the mall find other locations in Matteson.
Leon Carver, owner of LJ Graphics, said he wants to remain and is counting on some village assistance.
"I would hope so," he said of his remaining open at another location.
But Shareese Tovar, owner of the Ricardo Tovar shoe repair business, said no one had informed her of any possible help from Matteson to remain open.

Ultimate luxury auto market advances into SUV and hybrid terrain
Luxury market resurgance began before the global recession.
Competition pushes luxury makes to develop advanced and more diverse models
Not long ago, there was little warfare in the ultimate luxury marketplace where automakers seemed content to ride the prestige of their heritage. So steeped in marketing hubris was Rolls-Royce, despite being out-engineered by the decade-old Mercedes S-Class, that it claimed in a 1990 brochure: “It has never been the intention of Rolls-Royce to introduce change unless significantly advancing the cause of driver and passenger comfort.” 
In contrast, now there are several luxury automakers leading such advancements and vying for a rich piece of the luxury pie, where advanced luxury autos start around $100,000, tap $400,000 for Rolls-Royce or Bentley, and reach $1 million for custom “bespoke” models.
Luxury car buyers are eating it up.

Consider these stats: Rolls-Royce global sales rose 33% to a record 1,968 cars in the first half of 2014. Bentley announced deliveries are up 23% (same period) to 5,254 cars, citing growth in China and Middle East. Mercedes S-Class sales rose 81% and are expected to top 98,000 vehicles during 2014.
This reflects Rolls-Royce leveraging the less-imposing Ghost and Wraith, Bentley updating its 200 mph Flying Spur/Continental, and Aston Martin stretching with the V12-powered Rapide S sedan and “affordable” $99,900 Vantage GT. 
Mercedes-Benz’s S-Class, redesigned for 2014, will be joined by the 2015 S65 AMG with a twin-turbo V12 that reaches a top speed of 186-mph and comes with a near-$200,000 sticker. Porsche tempts with the $200,500 Panamera Turbo S Executive sedan that hits 192 mph; Range Rover extends its long-wheelbase reach with the Autobiography Black kit with Madagascar cabinetry costing $199,500.

“Growth in the top end luxury business is part of a global trend that was in place before the recession and accelerating as a result of the growth in affluence in the emerging markets and China,” said Kim McCullough, Brand V.P., Land Rover North America. “In the U.S., the stock market is at record highs and the economic recovery is in full swing.”
Clearly, these cars are not for every American.
Seeking intangibles
Buyers in this segment covet intangibles that defy logic.
“Emotion; above all the car is a luxury object,” said Christophe Georges, President & CEO, Bentley Motors, Inc. “This is the main difference between luxury and premium markets, followed by customers’ aspirations and they vary according to their motivations in term of performance, design, craftsmanship, and technology.”
Throttle a Bentley down the Mulsanne Straight or ford a river in a Range Rover to understand emotion is backed by capability. Heritage is also important.

“Of course heritage matters, but it must be combined with a future, otherwise it is just history,” said Julian Jenkins, Aston Martin’s president of the Americas. “Aston Martin customers are buying a sports car, but they are more widely buying into a lifestyle and a brand experience. We offer handcrafted, exclusive, beautifully designed cars backed by a globally recognized brand.”
Brand recognition is why Maybach didn’t work.
When Mercedes-Benz introduced Maybach in 2002 to compete with Rolls-Royce and Bentley, the rhetorical question was, “What, isn’t my Mercedes good enough?”
It was fine in the 1960s/70s when kings and rock stars drove 600s because the S-Class is beyond reproach. People buying a Maybach should not have to explain their purchase.  Lesson learned. 
Peer down a long hood to The Flying Lady and you know heritage matters. It represents an emotional realization of accomplishment that goes to the core of what a brand conveys about its owner – and it commands big money.
Evolving styles
The trend of SUVs outselling sedans for the first time in America extends to luxury models.
“North American consumers have more experience with SUVs than any other market in the world,” McCullough said. “The growth is a logical extension – luxury SUVs can do more, are more comfortable and are just as prestigious as any luxury sedan.”
Beyond jet-rivaling Range Rovers, customizers offer executive packages for Cadillac Escalades and other full-size SIVs. Bentley and Rolls-Royce will also go climbing.
“Our customers have been requesting an SUV for a long time, and we will offer the first genuine luxury SUV in the market with all Bentley attributes,” Georges said. “To be a true Bentley, it will have to meet our commitment to defining luxury. I believe our SUV creates a new segment, one that defines the luxury SUV space.”
With an expected price around $200,000, it will be twice the price of a Cadillac Escalade. Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Müller-Ötvös said his company is considering an SUV. 
Still, don’t disparage stately sedans, advanced hybrids, and familiar names returning to the market.
Advanced echelons
According to a report by Bloomberg, Mercedes plans a $1 Million S-Class Pullman limo with rear club seating - armor optional. Mercedes also plans super-luxurious “Maybach” versions of the S-Class, leveraging the dead brand’s cachet while elevating the three-pointed star.
Building on the Escalade and CTS-V, Cadillac will introduce a $100,000 sedan, tentatively called LTS and slated for 2016. Previewed by the Elmiraj concept , it wears iconic design cues over top-shelf engineering. Johan de Nysschen, former head of Infiniti and Audi USA, leads with an objective “to restore Cadillac to its place among global premium brands.” 
Cadillac sells the ELR plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, foreshadowing advancing technology.
“At the Beijing Motor Show earlier this year, we introduced our PHEV strategy in the Mulsanne Hybrid concept,” Georges said. “The SUV will see Bentley’s first PHEV application in 2017, capable of combining the traits one expects in a Bentley with an electric drivetrain.”
Georges expects 90% of Bentleys will be offered as hybrid by 2020. Porsche sells a hybrid Panamera. Rolls-Royce has shown electric Phantom concepts. Beyond efficiency, hybrids can summon ridiculous acceleration, moving beyond custom-fit luggage and veneered tray tables. Every automaker will have them. 
Given the rise of Asia and rebound in the U.S., the luxury segment will continue to grow. In Beijing, BMW introduced a concept that could slot between its 7-Series and Rolls-Royce Ghost.
“The extent of choice in the luxury market place continues to grow substantially and accordingly we would anticipate buyers seeking even greater levels of personalization capability.  We feel we are well placed to react to that demand,” Jenkins said.
It was once said you drive a Bentley, but are driven in a Rolls-Royce. Americans drive both plus many others. In a market that once saw benchmarks go a decade without significant change, unrelenting global competition meets desires of the wealthy – no matter the economy. 

4 Tips to Hone Your Content Marketing Strategyreddit
As any marketing professional or firm will tell you, it is no longer difficult or necessary to SELL clients and agencies on content marketing strategies highlighted by targeted blog posts, short videos and whitepapers busting with statistics. The benefits are endless and well-established -- drive traffic to your website, solicit contact information for lead generation, establish yourself as a credible source and many more. What you SHOULD be telling your clients, is how to make the most of your content -- ensuring delivery, download, engagement and return on investment.
Producing the content is only half the battle -- let's talk about winning the war and making sure your content marketing strategy achieves your desired goals:
1. Define your audience. Does your content have a specific end-user? The answer should always be, yes. If you are creating a whitepaper or blog post with the intent to receive downloads (and contact information) from a niche target audience, make sure your content addresses their pain points.  For example, a financial advisor may want to solicit information and web visits from individuals between the ages of 40 and 50 who are getting ready to send their children to college. Rather than title your content, "10 Ways to Save Money," try "The College Decision: 10 Finance Tips You Need to Know," or something to that effect. Yes, you may get less downloads and web visits. However, the qualified leads and traffic you do receive will be much more credible and likely yield higher ROI.
2. Promote effectively. Too many times, I see an ad on LinkedIn or Facebook that says something to the effect of "Click here to reduce costs by 20 percent." OF COURSE I want to reduce costs by 20 percent, who doesn't? However, I may want to know just what it is we're talking about! If I'm a marketer, and the cost-savings tip pertains to e-commerce, I'm bored already and will probably not consider you a credible source for content. Also, you were just charged $7.00 for my click. The same goes for e-mail blasts, the first thing most folks do with a nebulous e-mail blast is delete or unsubscribe. Similar to tip number one, try making it abundantly clear what the audience will receive if they pursue the content. If one were targeting a small business owner, then something like this may resonate -- "automate your invoicing for only $9.99 a month" -- as with this example, there is no gray area.
3. Ensure your landing page is efficient. How many times have you clicked an advertisement or link within an e-mail, only to find yourself directed to seven different sites, and required to fill out more information than during a doctor's visit? It happens all the time. Landing pages suffer from poor graphics, text that doesn't match the content you're pursuing, slow webpage load times, broken links and other content marketing atrocities. It's important to test your conversion process from start to finish, from the first click to the actual download/visit itself, to make sure there are no issues potentially damaging your credibility as a content source. Also, consider that most people don't want to provide too much information, so when soliciting info, stick to the basics: name, company affiliate (if B2B), location and have phone number and reason for visiting marked as optional.
4. Make sure your sales team is locked in. You are almost there! You created informative content, promoted it efficiently, and solicited plenty of sales leads. Now what? Don't let the conversion process stop there! Before structuring any content marketing campaign, ensure that you have a plan for what to do with those leads. The next step should require a phone call, introductory e-mail, physical mail or meeting or any other "touch point." In most cases, it is highly recommended to reply within 24 hours, at the latest, to ensure the lead doesn't go cold, and you receive the credit for your effective content marketing strategy!

Economic Empowerment Is Needed to Fight Terrorismreddit
While the main focus on fighting terrorism is through the use of intelligence, military muscle and force, another tool that is even more powerful in the long run is simple economics. It is well-established that there is a direct link between job creation and property rights and a drastic reduction in terrorism and political violence. Economic empowerment and citizen ownership of assets are proven weapons against terrorism and can and must be used to combat this problem.
According to economist Hernando De Soto, terrorism can be drastically reduced when a country's citizens join the formal economy. When we started working with De Soto, 62 percent of Peru's economy was non-tax paying and not officially recognized by the government; nevertheless, this "informal sector" generated 34 percent of Peru's economy and had more than $70 billion in assets. In his native Peru, De Soto was the architect of an economic reform program that brought over 380,000 informal businesses into the tax paying economy, creating over 500,000 jobs and generating $8 billion in tax revenue that was used for education, health, and infrastructure improvements. These changes gave hope to many who were economically disenfranchised.
What we saw in Peru is that when citizens are supporting their families and contributing to their community in a positive way, the threat of terrorism decreases. Before the reforms, Shining Path, a group that sponsored terrorism, controlled over 60 percent of Peru. Once the reforms took hold and the economy rebounded, the terrorists lost their grip on power.  They had lost their biggest recruitment tool -- poverty and despair.
While the terrorist threat in Peru may have differed in many ways to what we face today, the lessons learned there can be applied elsewhere, since one fundamental element has not changed -- a lack of opportunity and employment feed resentment and violence.
As De Soto himself has pointed out, these grievances were one of the main impetuses behind the initial protests that led to the Arab Spring. The key to economic empowerment is to create an environment where individuals have the opportunity to fully contribute and domestic economic growth can flourish. Such an environment requires institutions that allow individuals to start and grow businesses and join the formal sector. These institutions include the rule of law, property rights, upholding of contracts, and regulations that provide a level playing field where individuals can pursue their dreams and build a better life through hard work and innovation.
Without these fundamental elements in place, many small businesses are unable to move from the informal sector where they have difficulty accessing the credit needed to expand their businesses and where they can fall prey to corrupt practices. When you create an environment that enables people to succeed, citizens have a stake in the economy and a sense of hope for the future. These fundamental points must be kept in mind when fighting both terrorism and the poverty -- and the lack of opportunity -- that fuels it.
Reducing world poverty is being tackled on a global level through the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were established by the United Nations in 2000 and will expire next year. One of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that will form the basis of the post-2015 global development agenda is to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. One of the sub-goals is to achieve at least seven percent per annum GDP growth in the least developed countries.
Developing and building the institutions that support entrepreneurs as they start and grow businesses will need to be a fundamental piece of the strategy if these goals are to be accomplished. Peru has provided us with a compelling lesson. The message to policy makers around the world is clear: creating an environment where entrepreneurs and their businesses can succeed is a key tool in fighting poverty, providing economic opportunity and defeating terrorism, and one that must not be ignored.

West confronts Putin at Asia-Pacific summit over Ukraine crisis and MH17Putin had a close-up brush with Western anger over the Ukraine crisis and the downing of Flight MH17.
By: Agence-France Presse | Beijing | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:44 am
Russian President Vladimir Putin had a close-up brush with Western anger over the Ukraine crisis and the downing of Flight MH17, as the White House warned that his sanctions-hit government was staring at “isolation”.
Putin held separate bilateral meetings in Beijing with US President Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott — after the latter had used colourful sporting terminology to demand a face-to-face encounter with the Russian strongman.
But the Kremlin said that on the fate of the Malaysia Airlines plane at least, which the West says was downed by a Russian missile supplied to pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine, Putin was not standing in the way of a full and transparent accounting.
The White House said Obama and Putin had met three times today on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Chinese capital, which was taking place ahead of a G20 summit to be hosted by Abbott in Australia this weekend.
“Their conversations covered Iran, Syria, and Ukraine,” National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan told reporters in Beijing.
Both Russia and the United States are involved in the P5+1 talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, but on Syria Moscow is a key ally of Bashar al-Assad’s government and has supported him throughout the uprising that began in March 2011.
The biggest current differences between the US and Russia, though, are over Ukraine.
In mid-October, Putin accused Obama of having a hostile attitude towards Russia, while Obama decried “Russian aggression in Europe” in a recent speech to the United Nations General Assembly.
Earlier today US deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters in Beijing: “We continue to be deeply troubled by Russian activities. If they continue… it’s a recipe for isolation.”
Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union’s last leader, reportedly warned at the weekend that the world was on the “brink of a new Cold War” at an event to mark 25 years since the Berlin Wall’s fall.
Heading into today’s meetings, Abbott had pledged to “shirtfront” Putin over the fate of Flight MH17, which came down in July with the loss of 298 lives, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.
“Shirtfront” is an Australian Rules Football term in which a player violently charges an opponent.
“The leaders have robustly spoken out in favour of speeding up the investigation of the reasons for the tragedy,” the Kremlin said after Putin and Abbott met today at the APEC summit.

CM suspends four health officials
Eleven women died and 34 were reported critical on Tuesday after undergoing “faulty” sterilisation surgeries at a government-organised family planning camp in Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh.
Eighty three women underwent the procedure in five hours at the free sterilisation camp, organised by the Bilaspur district health department on November 8, at the Nemichand Jain hospital.
“Around 60 women fell sick after the surgery and were admitted to different hospitals in Bilaspur,”said District Collector S.K. Pardeshi.
“I had two babies in the last three years and wanted to go in for family planning. I got to know the district administration had organised a free camp and I underwent the sterilisation surgery on Saturday. Twelve hours after the operation, I started vomiting,” Deepa Yadav, 22, said.
Sarojini Kewat (26), a mother of four, said she started vomiting a few hours after the surgery while Hemlata Suryavanshi (25), a mother of three, said she developed breathing problems.
Chief Minister Raman Singh visited the victims at Bilaspur hospitals and suspended four health officials, including Health Director Kamalpreet Singh and Bilaspur Chief Medical Officer Dr. S.C. Bhange.
Mr. Singh has ordered an inquiry, besides announcing a compensation of Rs. 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 each for those who fell ill after the surgery. Health and Family Welfare Minster Amar Agrawal, who represents Bilaspur in the Assembly, took “complete moral responsibility” but said that there was no question of resigning.

Unhygienic conditions led to deaths: Congress
The Congress lashed out at the Chhattisgarh government on Tuesday over the death of 11 women due to “faulty sterilisation” in Bilaspur district on November 8.
“Medicines past their expiry date were given to the patients and the surgeries were conducted in an extremely unhygienic place which led to the deaths. This is criminal negligence on the part of the government,” State Congress president Bhupesh Baghel told reporters in Bilaspur after visiting the victims at a hospital here.
Congress leader and Bilaspur Mayor Vani Rao alleged that more than 18 women have died but “the government is deliberately hiding the facts. They admitted patients to different hospitals to conceal the facts.”
Congress workers protested against the State government and demanded resignation of Chief Minister Raman Singh and Health Minister Amar Agrawal and lodged an FIR against the duo at a police station in Bilaspur. “How can they conduct 83 surgeries in five hours when each surgery takes at least 20 minutes?,” asked Mr. Baghel. District Collector S.K. Pardeshi denied the allegations and said the cause of death would be known only after post-mortem.

Lower arabica output to limit 2014-15 coffee crop size at last year s levelsKarnataka planters peg coffee output flat at 3 lakh tonnes
Vishwanath Kulkarni
Parimala Rao Arabica coffee beans
Bangalore, Nov 12:  
Coffee production for the current season that began in October is likely to remain at last year’s level of around three lakh tonnes, on lower production of Arabicas, a growers’ body said.
“The Robusta crop is slightly bigger than last year, but a lower Arabica crop would keep the total size at last year’s levels,” said D Govindappa Jayaram, Chairman of the Karnataka Planters Association, ahead of the annual meet of the growers body.
“We expect the Arabica crop size to shrink to between 60,000 and 70,000 tonnes, while Robusta would be largely in line with the Coffee Board’s post-blossom estimate of 2.39 lakh tonnes,” he said.
Jayaram attributed the decline in Arabicas to high incidence of white stem borer and berry droppings caused by excess rainfall, mainly in key growing areas of Kodagu, Hassan and Chikmagalur. The 2014-15 is an off-year of the biennial production cycle for Arabicas, wherein output drops every alternate year. Further, the output of this mild and premium variety is also expected to suffer on account of diseases such as leaf rot and stalk rot that were caused by excess continuous precipitation, Jayaram said.
In its post-blossom estimates, the State-run Coffee Board had pegged the 2014-15 crop higher at 3.44 lakh tonnes comprising 1.05 lakh tonnes of Arabicas and 2.39 lakh tonnes of Robustas. The Board is yet to come out with its post-monsoon forecast for the 2014-15 season.
According to the Board’s final estimates for 2013-14, coffee output was 3.045 lakh tonnes, comprising 1.02 lakh tonnes of Arabicas and 2.023 lakh tonnes of Robustas.
Karnataka accounts for about two-thirds of the coffee produced in the country and the KPA is the apex growers’ body in the State. The fly-picking or the plucking of early ripened berries of the arabica variety has already commenced in parts of Kodagu and the full scale harvest is set to commence early December.
Further, Govindappa said the domestic coffee plantations have to increase productivity to be sustainable and remain viable as other large producers such as Brazil and Vietnam were way ahead of India on this count.
The KPA chief also suggested that the Government encourage adoption of ‘green technologies’ by planters by incentivising the usage of solar generators, wind and bio-gas generators at the plantations. He also opined that a subsidy for creation of estate brands will increase the visibility of Indian coffee, both in the domestic and overseas markets.

Why Fadnavis will find it tough to run Maharashtra with Sena in OppnWhy Fadnavis will find it tough to run Maharashtra
Ketaki Ghoge , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 12, 2014
First Published: 16:14 IST(12/11/2014) | Last Updated: 19:36 IST(12/11/2014)
Comments
The Shiv Sena's decision to oppose the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in a voice vote in the Maharashtra assembly on Wednesday was not a dream start for chief minister Devendra Fadnavis by any means.

Even though Fadnavis proved majority in the 288-member assembly amid protests by the Opposition, the Sena's stand could spell trouble for the BJP in the days to come.
Fadnavis, who wants to model his government on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's at the Centre, will now have to lead a minority government.
With Sena staking claim to the Opposition leader's post, CM Fadnavis may not be able to follow Modi, who is sailing on a full majority in the Parliament.
In the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, the BJP has 121 MLAs - down from 122 after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26. While the Shiv Sena has 63 MLAs, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has 41 legislators. The Sharad Pawar-led NCP has offered unconditional support to the BJP.
While Sena's dissent frees Fadnavis of a troublesome coalition ally, his government may now have to be dependent on the whims and fancies of NCP chief Pawar, even as it combats an Opposition led by the Sena, former BJP ally.
For starters, it translates into keeping a high-decibel corruption agenda on the back foot.
The NCP, however, reiterated after the trust vote that it wanted a stable government in the state.
"We will not destabilise the government in Maharashtra. We respect the mandate of people," NCP leader Nawab Malik told ANI, adding his party will not join the government.
Sources in the BJP admit its long-term plan has always been to occupy Sena territory in the state completely and, in case of a minority government, break legislators away from its saffron ally.
In the meanwhile, however, Fadnavis will have to walk a tightrope.
Besides not delivering on promises such as taking action in the irrigation scam, he will face hurdles to get his pet legislations like the Right to Services, Lokayukta Act and amendment to the Bombay Police Act passed unless the NCP is on board.
While getting bills and even the budget cleared in the state assembly may not be a problem given its strength of 122 legislators, the numbers go against the BJP in the legislative council (only 11 MLCs as opposed to NCP's 28, Congress 22 and Sena's eight).
The party will have to be at the mercy of the NCP in the council to get anything cleared for at least the next two years, till it can stake claim to many more MLC posts as and when the tenure of existing legislators expires.
By losing the support of 63 Sena legislators, the Fadnavis-led government will also open itself up to scrutiny and attack by a resurgent Opposition that will include three parties (considering the NCP has also taken a stance of being in the Opposition).
This means an attack on several fronts and may hinder delivering on promises made on toll-free roads, drip irrigation subsidies for farmers, welfare schemes for sugarcane farmers and pension schemes for women.
"With the state's financial health in a precarious position, delivering on the development agenda is going to be difficult. If Fadnavis has to prove himself, he will have to take some tough calls and that is not easy without a full majority,'' said a senior BJP leader.
Congress' newly elected deputy leader, Vijay Wadettiwar, said, "There have been so many empty promises by BJP that our line of attack will be easy. We have studied all of Modi's speeches made during the Assembly campaign and we will start by picking holes in them.''

Helped by softening prices of food items, the retail inflation declined to 5.52 per cent in October, the lowest since the new series of data was introduced in January 2012.
This is the fourth consecutive month of decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation or retail inflation which had fallen to 6.46 per cent in the previous month.
The overall food inflation measured on CPI came down to 5.59 per cent in October as against 7.67 per cent in the previous month.
Retail prices of vegetables declined by 1.45 per cent as against a rise of 8.59 per cent in September, according the the data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
Inflation in fruits slowed to 17.49 per cent from 22.4 per cent in September. Similarly the rate of price rise in protein rich items like eggs, fish and meat was at 6.34 per cent in October, slightly down from 6.35 per cent in the previous month.
The data on inflation based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for October will be released on Friday. WPI inflation had dropped to a near five-year low in September to 2.38 per cent, helped by moderation in food and fuel prices.
The Reserve Bank of India has of late started targeting retail inflation, while deciding on its bi-monthly monetary policy.
RBI has been targeting a retail inflation of 8 per cent by March 2015 and 6 per cent by March 2016.
RBI's next monetary policy is due on December 2, 2014.

Congress legislators disrupt Governors address in MahaAssemblyPrint

By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 6:48 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 7:09 pm
Congress legislators in Maharashtra on Wednesday disrupted Governor Vidyasagar Rao’s Address to the joint session of the state legislature, protesting the manner in which the 13-day-old BJP government won the trust vote.
Congress MLAs shouted slogans like “Dadagiri nahin chalegi (no bullying tactics),” and “Governor go back” as Rao began his Address.
Raising slogans like “down with the minority  government,” the Congress legislators walked out before the Governor could complete his Address.
Earlier, Sena legislators tried to stop the Governor from entering the Vidhan Bhawan to deliver his Address, and handed over to him a memorandum complaining the “unconstitutional” manner in which the vote of confidence was passed earlier in the day.

The Congress legislators including former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan squatted on the stairs of the Vidhan Bhawan building and blocked the Governor’s entry.
MPCC chief Manikrao Thakre said outside Vidhan Bhawan that no poll was taken during the trust vote today and it had become clear that the BJP government had trampled upon the Governor’s directives to have a vote of confidence.
The state Congress, soon after the trust vote, had sent a letter to the Governor requesting him not to deliver his Address to the joint session.
“The minority BJP government which has a strength of 123 MLAs when the majority mark is 145 was asked to prove majority in the House. But the motion was not put to vote. The BJP has not followed your directives and hence it is an unconstitutional government,” the letter said.
The party sought time from the Governor to explain the developments in the Legislative Assembly and said if the demand was not accepted it will resort to severe agitation.

Waives off electricity duty for 5 years; power tariff at Re 1/unit for new units
Ahmedabad, Nov 12:  
Extending the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make In India' concept, the government of Gujarat has made a generous move to encourage electronics manufacturing in the state. As per the newly announced electronics policy of the state, among other sops, the government will offer 100 per cent subsidy on central sales taxes (CST) and VAT refund equal to 90 per cent of capital investment made for expansion of the existing manufacturing units.
The government aims to generate employment for about 5 lakh people under the new policy which aims to attract investment of about $6 billion (approx Rs 3600 crore) by 2020 and generate business worth $16 billion (approx Rs 9600 crore).
Releasing the policy document for 2014-19, Chief Minister Anandiben Patel maintained that the policy aims to make Gujarat a globally-recognised hub for the Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) industry. The move is aimed at creating a dedicated Gujarat Electronics Mission, under which electronics hardware manufacturing will be encouraged.
For this, the policy entails series of sops in the form of subsidy for fresh investment in the clusters, interest subsidy of 7 per cent and two per cent for MSMEs and large units respectively, complete waiver of electricity duty for the initial five years with subsidised power tariff at Re 1 per unit among others. Additionally, R&D will get special encouragement with 50 per cent subsidy of the total project cost upto Rs 50 lakh.
The spokesperson of the state government Nitin Patel and Saurabh Patel informed that the new policy aims to focus on G2B - government to business. Considering the growth of electronics sector in the country, the import of electronics goods is expected to surpass that of petroleum products by 2020. Hence, the new policy takes into account these aspects and creates an environment to manufacture in India.
The state plans to create infrastructure to develop semi-conductor fabrication units. Also, the policy aims to develop green field and brown field electronics manufacturing clusters in the state.

Leading stock exchange Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has introduced two new segments, 'D' and 'DT', for listed companies to provide guidance to the investors.
"The companies which would apply for listing on the exchange through direct listing norms would be placed in the Group 'D' for trading in normal segment and in Group 'DT' for trade to trade segment," the BSE said in a circular.
In trade to trade segment, only delivery-based transactions are allowed and traders can't take intra-day positions.
BSE has classified equity scrips into categories such as Group A, Group B, Group T, among others, to provide a guidance to the investors. Group A is the most tracked segment consisting of about 200 scrips, while Group B consists of more than 3,000 stocks.
The classification is based on several factors like market capitalisation, trading volumes and numbers, track records, profits, dividends, shareholding patterns, and some qualitative aspects.
"All rules, regulations, norms/ guidelines pertaining to trading, risk management, clearing, settlement etc applicable presently and from time to time for scrips in the existing Groups would also be applicable to scrips in Group D and DT," BSE noted.

Iraq: 17 killed in bombings in and aroundBaghdadCivilians inspect the aftermath of a car bomb explosion in Sadr city, Baghdad. (Source: AP photo)
By: Associated Press | Baghdad | Posted: November 12, 2014 7:16 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 7:45 pm
Suspected Sunni militants struck in and around Baghdad on Wednesday, killing 17 people including 11 soldiers and policemen, and injuring about 40 in three separate attacks, including two suicide bombings, according to police and hospital officials.
The largest of Wednesday’s attacks was in the turbulent Youssifiyah district south of Baghdad where a suicide car bomber hit an army checkpoint, killing six soldiers and injuring 16, including 10 civilians and six soldiers.
Earlier in Baghdad’s upscale Mansour district, a car bomb near a cluster of shops killed six civilians and wounded 13.
Minutes later, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance of a nearby police station as officers were rushing out to the site of the first attack, killing five and injuring 10, all policemen.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but they all bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State group, whose fighters control about a third of the country after they blitzed across much of the north and west of Iraq this year.
Elsewhere in Iraq, government forces backed with Shiite militiamen are continuing to meet tough resistance from  Islamic State fighters in the refinery town of Beiji, a day after they pushed militants out of the town centre, a senior military official reached there by telephone said today.
The official said reinforcements have reached Beiji, 250 kilometres (155 miles) north of Baghdad, to protect areas of the town now under government control.
Booby-trapped houses and roadside bombs however were hindering their advance toward the northern and northwestern parts of the town, where Iraq’s largest refinery is located.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief reporters.
Lifting the siege of the refinery, which sits inside a sprawling complex whose capacity of some 320,000 barrels a day accounts for a quarter of Iraq’s refining capacity, was likely the next objective in the campaign to rid Beiji of the militants.
When fully retaken, the strategic town will likely be a base for a future push to take back Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit just to the south, one of the main prizes overrun by the extremists last summer.

Controversial LBT to be scrapped  Maharashtra GovernorannouncesBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 7:05 pm
Maharashtra government is going to scrap the controversial Local Body Tax (LBT), Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao on Wednesday told the state legislature in Mumbai.
“The Local Body Tax will be cancelled after making alternative arrangement shortly,” he said in his address to the House after the BJP government won the trust vote.
LBT was supposed to replace the octroi, however the trader community is opposed to it on the ground that it is complicated and involves a lot of paperwork.
The government will issue a white paper on the financial position of the state, liabilities, future plans and necessary measures for more transparent, effective expenditure, he said.
The government will felicitate the brave children who save others’ lives by risking their own by constituting an award in the name of the late police constable Tukaram Ombale (‘Hutatma Tukaram Ombale Balveer Award’), he said.
Special women’s squads would be created and deployed for the safety of women in the public places, adequate women police officers would be recruited; mobile phone technology will be used to prevent the violence against women, he said.
The government will make serious efforts to improve the low conviction rate, especially in the cases related to atrocities against scheduled castes and tribes, he added.
“My government shall enable the police to take recourse to best private legal support to achieve higher conviction rate. Witness protection programme shall be encouraged,” he said.
Saying that the state required huge investments for completing several ongoing projects in irrigation, transportation and basic infrastructure, the Governor added that there was a need to reorient public expenditure, eliminate revenue deficit and make more resources available for investment in capital assets.
“My government will devise a special strategy to control unnecessary expenditure, plug financial leakages, improve investment climate and reduce corruption. The government will launch a time-bound plan for speedy implementation of various pending projects with special emphasis on addressing the regional disparity in the state,” he said.

No  Regulation Is Not Keeping Banks From Making MoneyNo, Regulation Is Not Keeping Banks From Making Money
Posted:
Michael Bloomberg on Monday told a room full of bankers, traders, and investors that financial regulation was hurting their profitability and the U.S. economy. It was crowd-pleasing, but wrong.
In a speech at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's annual conference in New York,
Bloomberg criticized the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, saying , "if you reduce the risk, they can’t make the money, they can’t provide the financing that this country and world needs to create jobs and build infrastructure and all of those things." Bloomberg's anti-regulation comments were applauded by the crowd, BuzzFeed's Matthew Zeitlin reported .
But have banks really stopped being able to "make the money"? The answer is clearly no: As a percentage of total U.S. profits, the financial sector has bounced back remarkably well from the crisis it caused and the recession it triggered.
Banks' profits have been just under 30 percent of total corporate profits for the past few years, which is right about where they were during the mid-2000's boom. And this is still not a case of low profits elsewhere making banks' profits look relatively bigger. U.S. corporate profits have surged since the recession, and financial profits have gained back their pre-crises share. On an absolute basis, total U.S. financial profits are higher than they were before the crisis.
It might be true that, without financial reform, banks could be making even more money. But the idea that banks must make as much or more money than they currently do to help the U.S. economy grow, as Bloomberg suggested, is not supported by the facts.
For instance, JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the U.S. by deposits, has been doing relatively less and less of the kind of lending that supports economic growth, precisely as its profitability has soared. In 2008, the bank lent out just under 75 cents for every dollar of deposits it took in. It is now lending out 56 cents on the dollar.
Though JPMorgan's deposits have ballooned, the most profitable investments for it to make with those deposits aren't loans, but instead things like credit derivatives . In fact, with interest rates as low as they are, more lending might mean lower bank profits.
Contrary to Bloomberg's comments, banks are making plenty of money in spite of new regulations. And they are increasingly making their profits from activities that have little to do with job creation and building infrastructure.
Reached by The Huffington Post, Bloomberg LP spokesman Ty Trippet declined to provide additional comment.

Furious Congress men  injure  Maharashtra governorLetters to  the editor
Protesting legislators of Congress caused “injury” to Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao on the first day of the session today when they tried to block his entry into the legislature complex here, revenue minister Eknath Khadse said.
Speaking in the Assembly, Khadse said Congress legislators Rahul Bondre, Amar Kale, Ranjit Kamble, Vijay Wadettiwar and Abdul Sattar “caused injuries” to two legislature officials as well as the Governor.
Khadse said he wanted to move a resolution suspending these members for unruly behaviour.
“Governor’s left hand was injured. The issue does not end with an apology. This should not be tolerated,” Khadse said.
Congress leader in the House Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said there was no intention to cause hurt to anyone, but he would apologise.
NCP MLAs Ajit Pawar, R R Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, however, said the issue should be put to the rest with the apology if the report of Governor getting hurt was true.
Today is the first day of the new legislative Assembly and it should not start on a bitter note, the NCP leaders said.
BJP MLA Girish Mahajan said he was an eyewitness to the incident and it was a condemnable development.
Speaker Haribhau Bagde then adjourned the House for 30 minutes to discuss the issue with group leaders.

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has criticised the company and Tim Cook for delaying the launch of large-screen iPhones in the market by three years.
Wozniak, who left Apple in 1987, said Apple could have had a much bigger share of the smartphone market if it had a larger-screen iPhone for the past three years.
In an interview to CNN, he said the Tim Cook-led company would have competed better with Samsung Electronics had it released large-screen phones earlier.
The Korean company's 24 per cent share of the smartphone market wouldn't dwarf Apple's 12 per cent if it had responded more quickly to consumers' changing tastes, Wozniak said.

Khadse said he wanted to move a resolution suspending these members for unruly behaviour.
“Governor’s left hand was injured. The issue does not end with an apology. This should not be tolerated,” Khadse said.
Congress leader in the House Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said there was no intention to cause hurt to anyone, but he would apologise.
NCP MLAs Ajit Pawar, R R Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, however, said the issue should be put to the rest with the apology if the report of Governor getting hurt was true.
Today is the first day of the new legislative Assembly and it should not start on a bitter note, the NCP leaders said.
BJP MLA Girish Mahajan said he was an eyewitness to the incident and it was a condemnable development.
Speaker Haribhau Bagde then adjourned the House for 30 minutes to discuss the issue with group leaders.

Death by sterilisation in India: Chhattisgarh horror isn t just one failingThe death of 13 women at a state-run sterilisation camp in Chhattisgarh underlines flagrant violation of rules on implementing population stabilising campaigns as well as inadequate monitoring of such projects by health authorities across the country.
 
Although the coercive campaign spearheaded by Sanjay Gandhi in the 1970s has been replaced with a voluntary policy that promotes education of women and healthcare rather than demographic control, the Indian sterilisation programme remains deeply flawed, experts say.
 
For instance, the surgeries in Chhattisgarh were conducted in violation of a 2005 Supreme Court ruling that said a medical team could conduct only up to 30 surgeries a day with two separate laparoscopes. And, a doctor could do no more than 10 sterilisations a day.
 
But in Chhattisgarh, a lone surgeon performed 83 operations in less than 5 hours, showing that these operations were not done under standard protocols.
 
Official guidelines also say that all sterilisation camps must be organised in government facilities. The Chhattisgarh camp was organised in a private charitable hospital which had been closed for a year now. Media reports said rusty scalpels and tools were used and some of the medicines administered could have been spurious.
 
“The systemic failures which led to this incident need to be addressed,” said a joint statement of health workers and women’s groups said on Wednesday.
 
“The ‘camp method’ of sterilisation needs to be stopped with immediate effect as quality of care is seriously compromised in mass sterilisation programmes that are meeting earmarked targets.”
 
Sterilisation is the most popular form of birth control in India. Encouraged by cash incentives, about 4 million people a year undergo surgery. Almost all are women.
 
Experts say last week’s deadly incident is also a result of the pressure to meet the government’s sterilisation targets. In 2012, India committed to providing 48 million additional women and girls with access to contraceptives by 2020. However, in India about one in 5 women of reproductive age do not have access to modern method of contraception such as condoms and pills.
 
Chances are that India’s promises at the 2012 Family Planning Global Summit in London will reinforce the pressures of meeting ‘targets’, which has dangerous and long-term implications for the health of the people.
 
Many states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan are accused of setting unofficial sterilisation targets, violating the target-free population policy of 2000.
 
The overt emphasis placed on sterilising women is also out of step with best practices because male sterilisation such as vasectomy involves comparatively lesser health risks.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

How you can teach your kids to manage financesStory
No Child's Play
Children above the age of 10 can now manage their own accounts. Here's how you can inculcate financial freedom in your kids.
Teena Jain Kaushal        Edition: November 2014
Tips to instill financial freedom in your kids
For most of the people who were born before the 90s, opening a bank account was the gateway to financial indoctrination. Remember how you would scribble everywhere to make your signature look cool, only to be warned that it must be the same at all times? Most of us would probably still remember our first bank branch. But the good news is that the children of today may not have to wait as long as we had to, for opening a bank account. Following the recent guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in May, several banks have launched savings accounts for kids above the age of 10. These accounts can be operated independently by kids without any supervision from parents. All you need is to send him or her to the nearest branch to set them off on the path of banking.
The RBI guideline comes in at a time new generation kids need financial education more than ever. They need to be taught how to manage money as sooner or later they will be exposed to the use of credit and debit cards. The early they learn how to handle these, the better it will be for parents. Realising the need, the RBI has come out with guidelines on minors' account. It could be a first step to teach your kids the value of money. It will also help you save for the future while teaching them the basics of managing money.
What's on offer?
The concept of opening a kid's bank account is not new. But until now, accounts opened in the name of the kids were under the guidance of the guardian. New minor-operated accounts can be managed independently without supervision of parents. They are authorised to sign cheques and even transfer funds online. A child can visit the nearest branch with requisite documents and can open their account within a couple of days. While all banks provide the basic kit-a debit card, cheque book, and mobile alerts- the other facilities may vary from bank to bank. The minimum documents required for the know-your customer (KYC) process also varies from bank to bank. These accounts, generally, come in two variants. You can choose the account depending on the extent of control you want to give your child in terms of spending. For example, ICICI Bank's 'Smart Star Savings Account' with guardian consent has a debit transaction limit of Rs 2 lakh per annum while one without guardian consent has a debit transaction limit of Rs 50,000 per annum. If the debit transaction limit is breached during the year, the account gets frozen. You can choose the account depending on how much transaction limit you want your child exposed to.
The minimum balance requirement also varies from bank to bank. For instance, in ICICI Bank's Smart Star, a child needs to maintain a monthly balance of Rs 2,500 while in Federal Bank's Young Champ she has to maintain a quarterly balance of Rs 1,000 (It can be waived in Federal Bank if parents' account is opened along with the kid's account). SBI's PehliUdaan is a zero balance savings account.
Apart from helping children in understanding the concept of maintaining quarterly balance, you also need to inform them about charges imposed on non-maintenance of the balance, which in ICICI's case can be Rs 100 per month. Also, teach them how the average balance is calculated. Exposing these terms to your child would help them in life.
For ATM transactions the rules are same as for regular savings account. The first five transactions in a month are free, above which ATM of other banks charge Rs 20 per cash withdrawal. For non-financial transactions, such as balance enquiry, it is Rs 8.50 per transaction. Moreover, just like your regular savings account there might be certain limits on cash deposits and withdrawals. For example, ICICI Bank allows four free cash transactions per month in the same city, after which they charge Rs 90 for each transaction. Not only on number of transactions, there is a cap on value as well. For example, you cannot deposit more than Rs 50,000 per day from another city. Tell your kid to go through schedule of charges before opening an account. Tell them how much bank would charge if they do not maintain a minimum balance. Also, how processing charges are deducted if they transfer their funds online from one account to another.
Money gives us a sense of power but at the same time it also inculcates a sense of responsibility. Rahul Soota, executive director, mymoneymantra, a financial distribution company, says, "Kid's accounts teach children how to be careful with money. It helps parents in teaching kids about finance."
Checks and balances
Are minor-operated accounts really a right way to teach kids about finance? Yes, say experts. Manish Jain, a Gurgaon-based financial planner says, "Parents, generally, are skeptical about letting their child handle money. But it is our job to make them responsible and teach them at a young age about finance." Moreover, to keep a check on accounts banks impose withdrawal limits on debit cards. For example, while in SBI Bank and ICICI Bank a child cannot withdraw more than Rs 5,000 in a day, Federal Bank has the per day limit of up to Rs 2,500. Jain further says, "Parents can also check the passbook or an online account of their child fortnightly to understand where and how much they are spending. "
'Kid's accounts teach children to be careful with money. Parents can teach them about finance', says Rahul Soota, Executive Director, mymoneymantra
What to do?
It is good to teach children basics of finance as early as possible. Like, at the age of five to ten we can let them purchase things which they want, under our supervision. This way they will learn the role of money in life. By the time they are ten years old, try to make them understand the value of money. At this stage, opening a bank account can bring a sense of responsibility to the children.
Once your child learns basic banking introduce him to investment options. They would learn how interest is earned in a savings account. Most importantly, it would encourage children to start saving early and reap the benefits of compunding.

Now  pay less upfront to buy a houseStory
Pay less upfront to buy a house
The housing finance regulator, the National Housing Bank, or NHB, has increased the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio to 90% value of the property.

There is good news for those who were planning to buy a home this festive season. Now, they will have to shell out a lower amount as initial contribution. The housing finance regulator, the National Housing Bank, or NHB, has increased the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio to 90% value of the property. This will apply only to loans from housing finance companies or HFCs.
Prior to this, the LTV ratio was 75-90% depending on the loan amount.
According to the new regulations, in case of a home loan of more than Rs 20 lakh, an HFC can provide a loan of up to 90% value of the property provided that the increased limit is insured by a mortgage guarantee company.
Mortgage guarantee, also known as mortgage insurance, is a product which compensates lending institutions or HFCs for losses that may arise in case a home owner defaults on his loan. India's first mortgage guarantee company, India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation (IMGC), was established by NHB in 2012.
However, the LTV ratio will remain the same for a person applying for a loan above Rs 20 lakh but who doesn't take the loan under the mortgage guarantee programme. Let us explain it with an example. In the earlier scenario, there were only two parties involved, a borrower and an HFC. If a person approached an HFC for a loan of Rs 1 crore, he was entitled to get up to Rs 75 lakh. But now, if a person applies to an HFC for a loan of Rs 1 crore and agrees to go through the mortgage guarantee programme, he can get a loan of up to Rs 90 lakh. So, now, basically there will be three parties involved: the borrower, the HFC and the mortgage guarantee company.
For availing the facility of mortgage guarantee, the borrower will have to pay a premium, just like he pays for health insurance or life insurance, or the HFC will bear the cost. But experts believe it is unlikely that the HFCs will bear the cost; it will ultimately be passed on to borrowers.
"It is good for individuals, especially for the salaried class. Until now, to a buy a property of Rs 1 crore, they had to arrange for Rs 25 lakh. Now, by taking a loan under the mortgage guarantee programme, they will have to give only Rs 10 lakh as their contribution," says Sachin Choudhary, mortgage business head, Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. He added that it was a good move for mortgage guarantee companies as it would help them get a lot of leeway in the market.
"We don't see the need for mortgage guarantee under the current limit of 75%. For HFCs, we will get more customers with limited risk", he adds. Brijesh Panami, CEO, distribution, Destimoney Enterprises, believes this is a win-win situation for both HFCs and customers. "The consumer is getting the best value for his property. As the HFC will be disbursing a higher loan, it will earn higher interest income. It will also act as an anti-attrition tool because if they are meeting customers' demand, customers will not hunt for the extra money they would have needed. If the customer doesn't get his requirement fulfilled by a secured loan, then he hunts for an unsecured loan," he says.
Anil Sachidanand, MD & CEO, Aspire Housing Finance Company, says this has been done to encourage the mortgage guarantee programme in India, which is a welcome move.
However, he believes that reducing the upfront contribution limit required in case of retail loans is very negative for the savings habit of individuals as their contribution to the house will now be very low. In case property prices go down, they will have little incentive to repay the loan.

Soon  easier gold availability for smallfirmsGold futures price falls on global cues
Even as it is unlikely to relax gold import norms in the near future owing to persisting concerns on the current account deficit and trade deficit fronts, the government will soon bring out new guidelines to ensure timely availability of gold to micro and small enterprises making/selling gold jewellery.
This follows a court directive to the government after complaints from these firms that they are finding it difficult to get the yellow metal from banks and canalising agencies such as MMTC, STC and PEC.
The new guidelines will mandate greater transparency in gold sales of banks and canalising agencies, as well as simplification of auction and first-come-first-serve (FCFS) rules which are allegedly biased towards big units right now, according to official sources. The revenue ministry, following the Delhi High Court direction, had recently asked the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to consult stakeholders and streamline the guidelines by making it transparent, simple and uniform for all, the sources added.
Currently, banks and canalising agencies prefer big companies as they are interested in bulk sales rather than sales in small quantities, especially since there is huge demand for gold, the sources said.
In case of canalising agencies, they have an FCFS norm approved by their respective boards and which complies with Central Vigilance Commission norms. The sources, however, said the registration process of auction and FCFS is “cumbersome” and not online, adding that not only is the registration form difficult to obtain, but it also seeks many “unwanted” details, including location map of the firm just to delay the registration of small players.
“Many small players are already registered with other authorities, including the one on sales tax as well as with the Gems and Jewellery Exports Promotion Council, have an import export code as required by the DGFT and bank accounts. Instead of just taking copies of these documents, the canalising agencies through their opaque norms, keep asking for unnecessary details to ensure that small players are never able to take the benefit of the FCFS route,” an industry source said.

Slowing earnings growth signals caution for mktsSumeet Chatterjee and Patturaja Murugaboopathy     Mumbai/Bangalore   Last Updated: November 11, 2014  | 11:16 IST

Corporate earnings are growing at the weakest pace in nearly six years, in a more sober reflection of the economy than a domestic stock market hovering near record highs since the May election of pro-business Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The new PM, previously known for economy-stimulating infrastructure projects on a state level, has been widely touted as the man to revive an economy lumbering through the longest spell of sub-5 per cent growth in a quarter of a century.
Such is investor sentiment surrounding Modi's governence that the National Stock Exchange (NSE) index Nifty has risen by a third in 2014, touching a lifetime high on Wednesday.
But weakening corporate earnings growth highlight the domestic economy's continued need for increased investment, lower interest rates and a slower rate of inflation, company executives said.
"We did assume at the beginning of the year that domestic conditions would improve post elections," said R Shankar Raman, chief financial officer of conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T).
"It has, sentiment has improved, but the ground reality is still to change. I do think it will take a good six months for it (to) completely kick in. Hence, I want to be circumspect."
The median net profit growth of 102 domestic companies, which have reported July-September earnings, was 7.7 per cent, the lowest since October-December 2008, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data on companies tracked by at least one brokerage.
Median revenue growth at those companies - including cement maker ACC, financial services provider IDFC and mobile phone network operator Bharti Airtel - was 10.5 per cent, the lowest in nearly five years.
Revenue growth is likely to slow even more in October-December to 10 per cent, but will pick up to 12.5 per cent in January-March in line with a general expectation for quicker economic growth and a reduction in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Even so, Maruti Suzuki India, the country's largest carmaker, in October said its auto sales growth would slow in the second half of the current financial year ending March 31, 2015, cooling hope of an industry rebound after two years of declining sales.
"The situation of course is not as bright as many people hoped it would be at this point. We do not expect the growth in sales of Maruti will be as high a per centage (as) in the first half and this will slow down," said MSI chairman, RC Bhargava.
The downbeat outlook puts pressure on the prime minister to deliver on election promises to take "decisive action" to facilitate investment in power generation, roads and rail, to stimulate economic growth.
"We need some fundamental changes on the ground," said the CFO of a large domestic conglomerate who spoke on conditions of anonymity when expressing views on the government. "Up to now, there are many statements of intent, but there is no real investment," the CEO added.

U.K. Finds Good Use for Bank Fines: Helping Vetsu.k. finds good use for bank fines: helping vets
Trigger warning: This post disparages the proliferation of trigger warningsBy Jonathan H. Adler November 11
Trigger warning: This post is going to quote an op-ed that may offend sensitive readers. In particular, I am going to quote from a recent WSJ contribution by Harvey Silverglate , co-founder and chairman of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) on the ridiculousness of hyper-sensitivity and trigger warnings on campus. If you think trigger warnings are a good idea, you might not want to keep reading, and certainly don’t click the link to read the whole op-ed. If, on the other hand, you care about liberal arts education, believe in the ideals upon which a liberal arts education is premised and, above all else, believe that college students should be exposed to a wide range of ideas, many of which they may find challenging or unsettling, read on, click the link, and consider joining FIRE, which is perhaps the most important university-focused organization in the country today.
Silverglate’s op-ed, “How Liberalism Is Killing the Liberal Arts,” begins:
On campuses across the country, hostility toward unpopular ideas has become so irrational that many students, and some faculty members, now openly oppose freedom of speech. The hypersensitive consider the mere discussion of the topic of censorship to be potentially traumatic. Those who try to protect academic freedom and the ability of the academy to discuss the world as it is are swimming against the current. In such an atmosphere, liberal-arts education can’t survive.
It then recounts the recent experience of noted author Wendy Kaminer who, when speaking at Smith, had the temerity to suggest that college students should be able to read an unbowlderized version of Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, despite the presence of potentially offensive language, and (to the horror of many) actually repeated one of the words in question in discussing the book. For this, she was accused of having made racist remarks. Irony alert: The panel upon which she was speaking was titled “Challenging the Ideological Echo Chamber: Free Speech, Civil Discourse and the Liberal Arts.”
Silverglate’s op-ed, which should be read in its entirety, concludes:
Hypersensitivity to the trauma allegedly inflicted by listening to controversial ideas approaches a strange form of derangement—a disorder whose lethal spread in academia grows by the day. What should be the object of derision, a focus for satire, is instead the subject of serious faux academic discussion and precautionary warnings. For this disorder there is no effective quarantine. A whole generation of students soon will have imbibed the warped notions of justice and entitlement now handed down as dogma in the universities.

Iraqi Army Reportedly Recaptures Oil Refinery TownIraqi Army Drives Out Islamic State Extremists, Recaptures Oil Refinery Town: Report
 | By                                                                HAMZA HENDAWI
reddit
BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State group recaptured the heart of the town of Beiji, home to the country's largest oil refinery, state television and a military official said Tuesday.
Retaking Beiji, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Baghdad, could allow Iraqi forces a base to attack neighboring Tikrit, taken by the extremists after their lightning advance this summer. It also represents a morale boost for Iraq's beleaguered security forces, which saw many of its troops flee the militant offensive.
State television quoted the top army commander in Beiji, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, as saying troops recaptured the city's local government and police headquarters at the center of the town. It aired what appeared to be archival footage of the town showing Iraqi army troops firing their weapons from behind sand barriers.
Al-Saadi later spoke to state television by telephone but the line appeared to be cut off after he said his forces were meeting stiff resistance.
A senior military official reached by telephone in Beiji confirmed the recapture of the city center, but added that intense clashes continued elsewhere in the town. He told The Associated Press that 75 percent of Beiji was now in the hands of government troops. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.
Government officials in Baghdad offered no immediate comment on the reports. Al-Saadi said Saturday that his forces had recaptured most of the city and that it would soon be entirely rid of Islamic State group fighters.
There was no word on the fate of the refinery, which lies on the outskirts of the town and has been besieged by Islamic State fighters since June. The small army unit inside the refinery, resupplied and reinforced by air for months, successfully resisted wave after wave of extremist assaults.
Iraq's army and security forces partially have regrouped after melting away in the face of the summer's Islamic State offensive. In recent weeks, they recaptured a string of small towns and villages, but taking Beiji would be strategically significant in what is shaping up to be a drawn-out campaign against the extremists.
Recapturing Beiji also would be a major boost for Iraq's Shiite-led government and could pave the way for a fresh offensive to drive Islamic State militants from the nearby city of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown and the capital of Salahuddin province.
The campaign to retake Beiji suffered a serious setback Friday when a suicide truck bomber struck the convoy of a top Iraqi police officer, killing eight people, including the ranking official, Lt. Gen. Faisal Malik al-Zamel. Al-Zamel and al-Saadi jointly led the Beiji campaign, carried out by a contingent of troops and security forces drawn from a nearby military base and airlifted from government-controlled areas elsewhere.
Airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition have aided Iraqi forces, militias and Kurdish peshmerga fighters battling Islamic State militants. Hundreds of U.S. advisers and trainers also have been working with the Iraqis.
U.S. Central Command said Monday that coalition aircraft conducted seven airstrikes near Beiji since Friday, destroying three small militant units, a sniper position and two militant vehicles, including one used for construction.

Workplace Injury Insurance Must Be Part of the Rana Plaza Legacyreddit
In the 18 months since the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh, which killed over 1,100 garment factory workers and injured some 2,500 more, there has been a concerted effort to improve safety standards and working conditions in the country's ready-made garment (RMG) sector.
Brands and retailers joined the government and employer and worker organizations in Bangladesh, as well as multilateral organizations, international partners, regional institutions and global unions to address the immediate needs and the longer-term challenges brought on by the tragedy.
True, there have been frustrations and delays along the way. Raising sufficient funds for compensation payments has been slower and more complex than it should have been, for example.
But there have been positive changes. The Bangladesh Labor Act has been amended to strengthen fundamental rights, with improvements in relation to occupational safety and health, freedom of association and collective bargaining. As of the end of September, over 2,000 safety inspections have been carried out with some factories being closed permanently, while many others improved safety conditions.
The minimum wage for RMG workers has increased and the labor inspection system has been upgraded. Victims of the accident have received rehabilitation, training and counseling, to help them to regain employment and become self-sufficient again. And most surviving victims and families of those who died have been awarded compensation, with the claims process due to be completed over the coming weeks.
But for Rana Plaza to leave a lasting legacy, much remains to be done to ensure that the progress made thus far is sustainable and to achieve further improvements in occupational safety and health, working conditions, and respect for labor rights.
A lasting legacy of change
As we move forward, the focus needs to be on the better management of international supply chains across all sectors, with workers' safety and conditions at the heart of it.
Prevention is key but it is just as important to be prepared in case of future accidents. This can be done through an employment injury insurance (EII) scheme that spreads the risks across all employers at the national level. Such a scheme would provide an immediate response in terms of compensating those directly affected by workplace accidents.
These types of schemes are widely adopted across the world and provide reliable, low cost and no-fault accident compensation insurance for workers. Indeed, most countries that relied on commercial employer-liability insurance in the past have now converted their legislation to establish national EII schemes. This is because it is less costly to employers in the long run and no worker is left behind.
Most national EII schemes cost no more than 3 per cent of the total wage bill, which is a sound investment when compared to the potential reputational damage for companies and the impact on workers.
The Government of Bangladesh has shown keen interest to work with the ILO in setting up a national EII scheme. The ILO Convention on Employment Injury Benefits (No. 121) provides an internationally recognized normative reference to guide the government and social partners in designing national EII benefits and their delivery tailored to local realities.
What is needed now is the firm commitment of international partners, brands and retailers, alongside national counterparts, to help get a national EII scheme off the ground. Bangladesh could in turn provide a much-needed example for those other emerging export-oriented economies that do not have workplace insurance schemes in place.
The effective implementation of the Labor Act and a national EII scheme would ensure that Rana Plaza is not only remembered as one of the worst industrial accidents of its kind, but also a turning point for workers in Bangladesh.

DDA Housing Scheme Draw Unlikely Today
NDTV | Updated On: November 13, 2014 01:28 (IST)
RBI Doubles Pre-Paid Card Limit to Rs 1 Lakh
The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is most likely to hold the draw of lots for its Housing Scheme 2014 on Friday, a top official said. The housing authority has been conducting dry runs since Monday to check its preparedness.
Balvinder Kumar, vice chairman of DDA, told NDTV that the housing authority in all likelihood will hold the lucky draw on Friday.
He had earlier told NDTV that some applicants had reported issues with the data in their application forms. The DDA had uploaded the data on its website and applicants can check their form status on the DDA website.
The tentative date for the draw of lots was originally scheduled for November 10 and it was later postponed to November 12.
DDA has received over 10 lakh applications for the flagship 'Housing Scheme 2014', which was launched on September 1. There are over 25,000 flats on offer cross various categories.
The housing authority has planned for the first time to webcast the entire event live on YouTube.

Banking operations in India hit by staff strikeBanking operations in India hit by staff strike
Relief rally in NBFC stocksRelief rally in NBFC stocks

BL Research Bureau:  
Stocks of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) continue to remain in focus today, after the Reserve Bank of India tightened norms for NBFCs on Monday, to bring about a level playing field between NBFCs and banks. While the new regulations bring in more stringent asset quality norms for NBFCs, the additional time given by the RBI to comply with these norms has come as a relief to the sector.
The RBI has allowed NBFCs to implement these norms in a phased manner up to March 2018, which gives them enough time to migrate to the new regulatory norms. Leading the pack is M&M Finance which has moved up 10 per cent today, while the other such as Sundaram Finance, Shriram Transport Finance and Bajaj Finance have gone up 1-3 per cent.
One of the significant changes that have been made is the tightening of the NPA recognition norms. Currently, the loans, where borrowers have defaulted in their payments for 180 days or more, are classified as NPAs. Now, as per the new regulation, this has been brought down to 90 days at par with banks. This will lead to an increase in NPAs and hence provisioning requirements.
However, given that this will be enforced in a phased manner, the impact on earnings will be lower than what was expected earlier.
“On a snapshot basis there will be a rise because we have always been planning for a 180-day situation. However, as we have time to adjust – bring it down to 150 days in 18 months, to 120-day level by 2017 and 90-day by 2018 -- it gives us sufficient comfort. If the economy does improve, the situation can be far better managed without any serious impact on the financials or the company” says N Sivaraman, President & Wholetime Director, L&T Finance Holdings.
Also some of the companies are well provided for and have been following a prudent asset classification norm. Bajaj Finance for instance has already moved more than 90 per cent of its loan portfolio to 90-day cut off. Sundaram Finance too has moved to a 120-day norm.
But some players feel that as their customers have irregular income and cash flows, it may be difficult to conform to these norms.
“Most of our customers, who make their livelihood from running the vehicle (small truck operator), do not have regular income and their cash flows are not smooth. So their ability to pay is not as predictable as any banking customer,” says Umesh Revankar, Managing Director, Shriram Transport Finance.
“Also, the impact may be more when we migrate from 120 to 90 days. Right now, it may be difficult to calculate, because the average tenure of our portfolio is 3 years. So by 2017, what will happen is difficult to guess,” he adds.
Other tweaks
The RBI has also increased the capital requirement—Tier I capital adequacy from 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent. Given that most players are well capitalised and the RBI has given time up to March 2017 to comply with this norm, the business growth of most companies may not be impacted.
The RBI has also tweaked the norm on acceptance of deposits. All asset financing NBFCs will now be allowed to accept deposits upto 1.5 times their net owned funds, down from four times earlier. However, with most NBFCs having deposits well within this limit, the impact will not be significant.

28 things you should never say to your boss28 Things You Should Never Say To Your Boss
By Jacquelyn Smith | Business Insider –  Mon 20 Oct, 2014 3:30 AM IST
University of Exeter/flickr Be honest — but be careful.
Honesty is the best policy in the workplace — with a few exceptions.
"It's important to be cautious with what you say to your boss, as even the slightest slip up could make or break your career," says Ryan Kahn, a career coach, founder of  The Hired Group , and author of " Hired! The Guide for the Recent Grad ."  "There are the obvious things to hold back from saying to your boss, but the key is to dissect the little things in your interactions."  
Lynn Taylor, a national workplace expert and the author of " Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job ," agrees. "There are certain comments and questions based on negative perspectives that can set you back with your boss," she says. "If they continue unabated, these phrases can sabotage an otherwise great job."  
A good practice is to first pause before blurting out something you might regret and examine what you're trying to achieve, and the likely reaction you'll get from your boss.
"If you think you may regret it, you probably will," she says. "Better to err on the side of waiting until you can crystallize your thoughts into a more palatable and professional dialogue."
In honor of National Boss Day, which is celebrated in the US on October 16 each year, we've compiled a list of the words and phrases you should never say to your manager.
Aside from the obvious — like profanity and insults — here are 28 phrases you should avoid:
"I can't."  
A "can-do" attitude is always a valued trait. "I can't" shows both a lack of confidence and unwillingness to take chances — neither of which will endear you to management, says Taylor.
"That's not my area." Or, "That's not part of my job."
No job description is ever set in stone. "As cross-functional teams remain the order of the day, you're expected to be flexible and make your boss' life easier," Taylor explains. "As a side note, the more skillsets you accumulate, the more indispensable you are."
Saying that you're not willing to go beyond your role shows that you are also not willing to pitch in for the success of the company, Kahn adds.
"I don't know."
You may not have the answers to every question, but your best guess and a promise to find out is much better than a shrug of the shoulders, she says. "Anytime your boss would need to do the work for you, assume that's not a path you should take."
"No."
Your cooperation is expected, and so is a polite tone. " Telling your boss 'no' is a challenge , and is sometimes necessary — but it can be inappropriate if you don't phrase it well with an explanation," Taylor says. "For example, if your boss says, 'Do you have time to work on the Smith project today?' you shouldn't just say, 'No.' Instead try something like, 'Today will be a challenge if you still want me to focus on that company presentation. Would you prefer I work on this today instead?'"
"I'll try."
Some people think that this is an acceptable response, as we all "try" to get things done to our best ability. But it leaves a manager feeling unsure, and when assignments are given, your boss is counting on you, usually with specific deadlines, says Taylor. "Imagine yourself asking, 'Will you be signing off on my paycheck on the 15th?' and your boss responding, 'I will try.'"
"That's not what I heard."
Avoiding gossip and conjecture is a good idea, as it can backfire. If you're not sure about something, wait, or you risk appearing unprofessional.  
"How do I benefit from this?"
Sometimes your work involves helping others and other departments. Bosses have little tolerance for those who aren't team players, Taylor says.
University of Exeter/flickr Don't make excuses.
"I'm sorry, but…" 
"The caveat essentially cancels any genuine apologetic sentiment," Taylor says. "A straight, 'I'm sorry…I'll be much more aware of this next time' is the expected response when you mess up."
"Well, I did my best."
This is a cop-out. If you made a mistake, and that was your best, that doesn't speak highly of your abilities. The better response is that you'll get it right next time.
"I'll leave."
Don't threaten to leave the company, says Kahn. It's unprofessional and they'll consider you a flight risk.
"I just assumed that…"
That phrase causes frustration for many bosses, as they'd rather hear that you made an error in judgment and learned from it, versus excuses. "To err is human, but to defer blame is a career killer," Taylor says.
"I've tried that before."  
Bosses have little tolerance for laziness. "Examine whether you really gave the option a shot before you shoot it down," she suggests. "Your boss may have something else in mind." Alternatively, explain that you appreciate the suggestion, and tried XYZ, with such and such a result — but would be glad to try something more effective.
"At my last job we did it this way."
No manager likes a know-it-all, so you must tread lightly if you think you have a better way. "You're better off phrasing sensitive or challenging responses by turning them into questions versus being confrontational," Taylor says.
"It's really not my fault; it's John's fault."
The blame game is a treacherous path. If you're innocent, then explain why. Don't implicate others if you bear the primary responsibility, Taylor says.
"Taking responsibility is key," adds Kahn. "If your always seen as someone pointing the finger, eventually your boss is going to question who is really to blame."
"[Your predecessor] did this differently/better."
"Bosses usually feel that their methods are preferred over their predecessors because they now hold the position," Taylor explains. "Unless a method is clearly a mistake, don't challenge your boss with the 'old ways of doing things' just because they made things easier for you."
"I'm bored."
"You may have a weak moment and share your boredom with the wrong person: your boss," says Taylor. "You're being paid to be productive and remain enthusiastic; it's your responsibility to find ways to make your job interesting."  
"I can't work with him/her."
"Not playing well with others" isn't good in elementary school, nor is it in the workplace. It's assumed that you are capable of getting beyond personality conflicts in the interest of delivering excellent results.
"He's a jerk."
"The golden rule is something your boss expects you to observe, and casting aspersions on others has no redeeming value. It just reflects badly on you," she says.
"If I don't hear from you, I'll just do X."
This has a threatening tone. Better to wait than be admonished later.
"Why does Jane always…?"
Whining is annoying. "If you have a gripe, better to ask how you can attain a certain privilege, and leave others out of the discussion," she suggests.
"Can I/we speak with your boss about this?" Or, "I want to speak with HR about this."
"Going over your boss' head challenges authority — a usually no-win situation, unless you're about to quit (or be terminated) and have no other recourse," says Taylor.
If you're going to HR, don't threaten in advance, she adds. "And you should avoid it unless you've exhausted all the options with your boss."
"I don't have a solution."
Don't tell the boss about problems without presenting potential solutions, says Kahn. "Leaders talk about solutions; followers talk about the problems."
"Why does John have X and I don't?"
Focus on your own career, not others' salary or promotions — unless you're witnessing blatant favoritism. "If that's the case, you can opt for a more professional discussion once you've collected your thoughts about the facts," Taylor says.
"I'm pretty busy. Can it wait?"
It's your responsibility to ask your boss if priorities have changed, as your objectives must stay aligned with your manager's. "Priorities are rarely stagnant, so as in most cases, your better option is to ask if you should reshuffle them," she recommends.
"Can I leave early today since things are slow?"
It's fine if you have to leave early. But don't say it's because "things are slow" or you have "nothing to do." "There are always more projects in the pipeline. Bosses want you to show initiative," she says.
"That's impossible."
Your manager doesn't want to hear negativity or a lack of conviction. If you have concerns, state what they are, and ask for input.
One of the best approaches in deciding whether to share your thoughts with your boss or ask sensitive questions is to put yourself in their shoes, Taylor suggests. "Do your comments and questions reflect a positive, can-do, and confident demeanor? Remember loose lips sink ships ­— so choose your words carefully when you feel challenged at work if you want to thrive in your career."

Online Insurance Sales To Touch Rs.15 000 Crore By 2020: ReportOnline Insurance Sales To Touch Rs.15 000 Crore By 2020: Report
Study warns against vehicular pollutionNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
A new report today warned against vehicular pollution in the country, saying if the trend continues it will cause alarming rise of deadly Particulate Matter (PM), which is believed to pose the greatest health risk in the air.
“If the current trends of vehicle population, fuel and emission standards persist, PM 2.5 (PM particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres) emissions will increase by a factor of three, and those of NOx (one of a group of highly reactive gasses) will increase by a factor of five,” according to the report.
The report was prepared by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
According to the report, titled ‘Options to Reduce Road Transport Pollution in India’,the transport sector contributes about 15 to 50 per cent of PM 2.5 emissions in cities, and is a dominant contributor to NOx emissions.
The World Health Organization estimates that, of the 67 risk factors studied in its Global Burden of Disease project, outdoor air pollution was ranked 5th in mortality and 7th in health burden in India, contributing to over 6,27,000 deaths and 17.7 million healthy years of life lost in 2010.
The report establishes the scientific basis for reducing emissions, the technologies available, and governance issues that need to be urgently addressed to improve air quality.
The report comes at a time when the transport sector is experiencing significant growth in the country and vehicle population has grown seven-fold in the past two decades. It also presented city-wise contribution in emissions from the transportation sector.
Within the transportation sector, heavy-duty trucks are the largest black carbon (BC) emitters followed by bus, which is followed by three-wheelers. As for PM 2.5, heavy-duty trucks emit most followed by two-wheelers and then three-wheelers.
“City wise, transportation also stands as the largest emitter of PM2.5 in Bangalore (followed by Diesel Generator sets), Pune (followed by secondary formation) and Kanpur (followed by domestic),” it says.
Heavy-duty trucks are large sources of BC and PM2.5 in states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat as well as cities such as Delhi and Chennai. Two wheelers are the largest source of PM2.5 emission in Delhi.
The report says that drastic reduction (more than 90 per cent) of Particulate Matter (PM) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) from the transportation sector, primarily diesel vehicles and buses, will have the largest and most immediate beneficial impact on human health and food supply.
“More than 75 per cent of PM 2.5 particles (also known as aerosols in the climate literature) from diesel vehicles is black carbon aerosols (or particles), a major contributor to global warming and melting of Himalayan glaciers,” says the report.
It is expected to grow from 140 million in 2011 to about 400 million during the next two decades. “Clearly, Indian citizens are on the move and are prospering from the growth,” it said.
“But this growth will worsen the air pollution problem in India and will come at a huge cost to public health and crop yields. It also has consequences to monsoon rainfall, Himalayan glaciers and regional climate,” it says.
PM 2.5 is the dominant contributor to premature deaths and numerous other illnesses, followed by Ozone and NOx, the other two major contributors to health impacts.
It says that drastic reductions in PM 2.5 and NOx emissions will also mitigate impacts of black carbon and nitrate aerosols (resulting from NOx) on precipitation and regional climate change. “It is a win-win action for all aspects of sustainability,” it added.

Make sure you dont chose the wrong health planBy Jonnelle Marte November 12 Follow @jonnelle
HealthCare.gov has been revamped as its second enrollment season approaches. (AP Photo/file)
Most people try to get through open enrollment  without changing a thing . But that inertia might cost them hundreds of dollars later.
Even people who haven’t seen a change in their jobs, health or coverage may have to pay more next year than they did this year. That’s because they could be passing up on a new plan that might be a better fit. And with more insurance companies taking part in the public insurance exchanges this year, some people might find they’ll get a smaller subsidy — even if their plan stayed the same.
“Last year we focused so much on just understanding the Affordable Care Act,” says Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealthInsurance, an online insurance broker. “This year is really about picking the right plan.”
It’s complicated stuff. Oddly enough, people who make a decision based just on price may end up paying more than they need to. Whether you’re comparing the options offered through your job or shopping on the exchanges , here are some steps to keep you from ending up in the wrong plan this open enrollment season.
1. Reapply if you’re buying on the exchanges. Many people who bought insurance on ACA exchanges last year will be automatically enrolled into those plans for next year. But that doesn’t mean their costs won’t change. People who changed jobs, got a raise or aren’t making as much as they did last year should update their information on the exchanges to make sure their subsidy isn’t too big or too small. Workers who can get affordable coverage through their jobs won’t qualify for subsidies, even if they meet the income requirements. (Generally, subsidies are available to people earning between the poverty level and four times the poverty level.)
Some people might be missing out on more than just the subsidy — they might be limiting their plan options altogether. People who make below 250 percent of the poverty level can access plans with lower deductibles and copayments, says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow for the Kaiser Family Foundation. If their income isn’t updated in the system, those plans may not come up when they search on the exchanges, she says.
2. Watch out for price changes. Premiums aren’t expected to increase by much, overall, this year. But some local markets may see big jumps, or drops, in price as more insurance companies enter the exchanges, McLean says. Those who don’t shop around could be passing up a better deal, she says. People receiving federal subsidies might also have to pay more for their plans — even if those plans cost the same and if they’re making the same as they did last year.
As my colleague Jason Millman reported, that’s because some areas will see a change in what’s known as the “benchmark” plan , or the second lowest cost silver plan on which subsidies are based. If the benchmark status goes to a cheaper plan, some people in that market may find their subsidies won’t go as far as they did last year, even if their plans stayed the same.
3. Double check that your doctor and drugs are covered. Some people chose plans last year based on price only to find out later that the doctors or the medications they need are not included, McLean says. Any savings they made by choosing plans with lower premiums were likely erased when they got bills for doctors’ visits or prescriptions that weren’t covered, she says. Some 23 percent of eHealth customers surveyed this summer said they plan to avoid making that same mistake this year.
eHealth has a tool that lets people search a doctor’s name to see which plans include that doctor in the network (though not all exchange plans will be included). Insurance companies also offer information on their Web sites about which doctors, hospitals and drugs are covered by specific plans. When it comes to drugs, people should check what tier a medication is in for the plan they’re considering, says John Barkett, director of health policy affairs for Towers Watson, a human resources consulting firm. Generally, a tier 1 drug (usually a generic) will be cheapest while a tier 3 drug (typically brand name) will be most expensive.
4. Start early. Most people procrastinate when it comes to anything related to money. But you don’t have as much time to choose a plan this year as you did last year. The open enrollment period for the exchanges, which starts Nov. 15 and ends Feb. 15, is half as long as it was last year. Those who want to be covered by Jan. 1 need to decide by Dec. 15.
People should start shopping sooner rather than later so that they can give themselves time to deal with any technical glitches and to properly compare plans, says Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health. The same goes for people who are comparing plans offered through their jobs, where they might only have a few weeks to make a change. “You don’t want to get jammed on this,” he says.
5. Re-evaluate family coverage. As much as you would like to avoid it, now is the time to make sure your family is signed up in the most affordable plan. Some employers are making it more expensive to include a spouse or child, so you may find it’s cheaper to move the children over to your partner’s plan. Some families may even find that it’s less expensive to move part of the family on to plan purchased through the exchanges, says Carolyn McClanahan, founder of Life Planning Partners. (They probably won’t qualify for a subsidy, however, if they can be added to an employer-provided plan.)

Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao injured as Congress legislators try to block his entry

('Congress legislators Rahul Bondre, Amar Kale, Ranjit Kamble,…)
MUMBAI: Protesting legislators of Congress caused "injury" to Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao on the first day of the session today when they tried to block his entry into the legislature complex here, revenue minister Eknath Khadse said.
Speaking in the Assembly,Khadse said Congress legislators Rahul Bondre , Amar Kale , Ranjit Kamble , Vijay Wadettiwar and Abdul Sattar "caused injuries" to two legislature officials as well as the Governor.
Khadse said he wanted to move a resolution suspending these members for unruly behaviour.
"Governor's left hand was injured. The issue does not end with an apology. This should not be tolerated," Khadse said.
Congress leader in the House Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said there was no intention to cause hurt to anyone, but he would apologise.
NCP MLAs Ajit Pawar, R R Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, however, said the issue should be put to the rest with the apology if the report of Governor getting hurt was true.
Today is the first day of the new legislative Assembly and it should not start on a bitter note, the NCP leaders said.
BJP MLA Girish Mahajan said he was an eyewitness to the incident and it was a condemnable development.
Speaker Haribhau Bagde then adjourned the House for 30 minutes to discuss the issue with group leaders.

Listing of REITs will bring transparency in ...Ananta Barua
(Sebi is in talks with the…)
MUMBAI: The real estate investment trusts (REITs) will usher in a great deal of transparency in the sector and thus attract global funds, a senior executive of market watchdog Sebi said today.
In September, Sebi had notified the norms for listing of business trust structures, Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) that would help attract more funds in a transparent manner into realty and infrastructure sectors.
Both the structures, norms of which were approved by the regulator in August, would get tax incentives.
"Tax incentives are key to the success of REITs and InvITs, as that would help attract more funds in a transparent manner into realty and infrastructure sectors. Additionally, compulsory listing of REITs will also usher in transparency in Indian markets," Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Executive Director Ananta Barua said at a real estate event organised by RICS here today.
The Board is in talks with the Finance Ministry to introduce tax incentives for real estate investment trusts (REITs) to make these instruments stage a successful take-off, he said.
Four stages of taxation are involved in the two trusts - first while structuring and transferring assets to REITs or InvITs, second when they distribute income to their investors, third when they are traded and fourth time when there is an exit.
"These are heavy stages so tax issues have to be addressed," he added.
As per the notification, for both trusts, the minimum initial offer size should be Rs 250 crore with a public float of at least 25 per cent, while the minimum asset base for these trusts to get listed is Rs 500 crore.
"With the twin objective of spurring growth back and infuse more liquidity in to the real estate market , the government's move to set up the REITs is laudable. While REITs will provide investors an investment avenue, which is comparatively less risky than investing in under-construction properties, implementation will also give them easier exit routes along with regular income in terms of returns," RICS Global Managing Director- Emerging Business Sachin Sandhir said.

NMDC-led consortium may buy 30% stake in AcronAcron
(State-run NMDC-led consortium…)
NEW DELHI: State-run NMDC-led consortium is planning to buy 30 per cent stake in the Russian potash firm Acron, which may result in an investment of around Rs 1,000 crore.
Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF), National Fertilizers Ltd (NFL), Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd (FACT) and fertiliser cooperative Kribhco are the four other entities which are part of this consortium.
Along with purchasing 30 per cent stake, the consortium is also looking to enter into an offtake agreement for import of Potash from the Russian firm, a top official of NMDC told PTI.
At present, National Mines Development Corporation (NMDC) is conducting a feasibility study at a cost of Rs 2 crore on this proposal, the official added.
The official also said that buying a 30 per cent stake in Acron would cost something around Rs 1,000 crore.
When contacted a senior official in the government confirmed the development and said that final decision would be taken after the final report of feasibility study, and added, "if proposal turned out to be feasible an agreement may be signed during the visit of Russian President to the country this year."
India imports 100 per cent of its requirement of potash, which was about 3 million tonnes (MT) in 2013-14.
In 2013-14, potash was imported at average price of USD 390 per tonne. In the current fiscal so far the country has imported 2.7 MT of potash at an average price of about USD 330 per tonne. Indian Potash Ltd is one of the major importers of potash while Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers.
Potash is a decontrolled fertiliser and government pays fixed subsidy on it. It is mainly used in the form of Muriate of Potash (MoP) by farmer as soil nutrient and also used in the manufacturing of complex NPK fertilisers.

India my second home  Myanmars Suu Kyi tells PMModiPrime Minister Narendra Modi shakes hands with Chairperson and General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi during a meeting at Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar on Wednesday. (Source: PTI)
By: Press Trust of India | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 12, 2014 7:45 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday met Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi who described India as her “second home”, recalling her years spent in the country.
It was Modi’s first interaction with the 69-year-old pro-democracy icon.
The Prime Minister referred to Suu Kyi as a “symbol of democracy”, referring to the enormous efforts made by her for restoration of democracy in Myanmar long ruled by military junta.
After the meeting, spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs, Syed Akbaruddin tweeted that the Myanmarese leader had told Modi that India was her “second home”.
India is my second home – Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to @PMOIndia . pic.twitter.com/K7HFLupha1
— Syed Akbaruddin (@MEAIndia) November 12, 2014
He told reporters that Suu Kyi was effusive in her praise of India.
Suu Kyi told Modi that India was the first country to which she travelled from Burma, which was the old name of Myanmar.
The opposition leader also underscored the importance of stability going hand in hand with democracy.
The Prime Minister also presented Suu Kyi with a special copy of Mahatma Gandhi’s commentary on Bhagwad Gita.
Asked by a journalist whether the prime minister had extended an invitation to the Myanmar leader to visit India, the spokesperson said, “the invitation to Aung San Suu Kyi to visit India is always available as no one invites one to her second home”.
The meeting at the Presidential Suite at Park Royal Hotel here where the prime minister is put up, came on a day when he had a string of bilateral meetings with world leaders and participated in the 12th India-ASEAN summit.
Myanmar is in the midst of a national debate on whether to allow Suu Kyi, Chairperson and General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, to contest the 2015 parliamentary elections, which she is barred from at present due to a provision in the Constitution.
Suu Kyi last visited India in November, 2012. She spent several years in India during her early days when her mother Daw Khin Yi was Ambassador to India. She studied at Lady Shri Ram College in New Delhi and also spent some time as a Fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study in Shimla in 1987.

Orissa journalists lodge FIR against BJD MP and MLA over attempts to bribethemAngry journalists in press meet at Puri waving the envelope at the organisers after they found Rs 200 slipped in their press kits. (Source: IE photo)
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 12:59 am
In a shameful cash-for-coverage episode, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development headed by BJD MP Pinaki Mishra on Wednesday allegedly tried to bribe journalists in temple town of Puri in a press conference causing much outrage among the mediapersons in the town. Soon after the incident came to light more than a dozen journalists in Puri lodged a complaint against Mishra and BJD MLA Maheswar Mohanty accusing them of bribing the members of fourth estate for favourable coverage.
The Committee headed by Puri MP Pinaki Mishra came to Puri on Tuesday to oversee some of the developmental works being undertaken by the union ministry and discuss the progress of some of the projects. Soon after the discussion, a press conference sponsored by Uco Bank was organised at Mayfair Hotel in Puri where the journalists were allegedly given Rs 200 in envelopes.
“When we found the currency notes tucked inside envelopes in the notepad, we started protesting. It was a cheap attempt of the organisers to get a favourable media coverage,” said Jit Patnaik, reporter of a local TV channel. “We all boycotted the press conference.” Some of the reporters later lodged a complaint with the Sea Beach police station against the BJD MP and MLA over the “bribery”
attempt.
However, in a second press conference organised by Uco Bank on behalf of the standing committee at Bhuaneswar, Rs 300 were allegedly given in envelopes to about 40 journalists who attended it. No one is known to have returned the money.
Mishra, who was addressing the press meet, however said there was no attempt to bribe the journalists. “The bank gives conveyance allowance to journalists in such press meets. It was just mere courtesy. There is no quid pro quo arrangement. I find it ridiculous that journalists can be bribed by Rs 200. I don’t care for such FIRs. I know how to deal with such things,” he said.
Mishra said the whole controversy was engineered by his rivals who envied the rise of BJD in Puri.  “Of the 53 journalists who attended the press conference, 15 returned the money while the rest did not complain,” he added.
Puri SP Ashis Singh said the police were still not sure under which section of IPC can a case be lodged against the organisers. “There is
no electoral code of conduct in place now. But we are still closel scrutinising the complaint and would take appropriate steps,” he said.
Opposition Congress and BJP said the ‘bribery incident’ only proved the political culture of the ruling party and was a brazen attempt to
buy the media. “After buying votes through money power, the party now wants to use money power in continued…

MPPEB scam: MP High Court constitutesSITPrint
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: November 12, 2014 7:24 pm
The Madhya Pradesh High Court on Wednesday constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to monitor the ongoing probe into the MPPEB scam by nominating former deputy Lokayukta Justice Chandresh Bhushan as chairman and retired Special Director General of CRPF Vijay Raman and former deputy director general, NIC, C L M Reddy as members.
The scam that involved impersonation and fudging of records among other irregularities in the Pre-Medical Test (PMT) and other examinations conducted by the state professional examination board had come to light in July 2013 but its real impact was felt much later by the political establishment in the state.
The high court while rejecting several PILs seeking a CBI probe into the scam had recently ordered that an SIT will be formed for effective monitoring of the probe being conducted by the Special Task Force (STF), a wing of the Madhya Pradesh police. The investigation was being already monitored by the high court but several petitioners, including former chief minister Digvijay Singh, wanted a probe by a central agency arguing that STF officials were not expected to carry out an impartial probe due to involvement of highest echelons of political establishment.
Chief Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice Aok Aradhe on Monday had asked the government to submit a list of officers above the rank of ADGP who retired from the service of Madhya Pradesh government as also on deputation with the Central government. The names were submitted in a sealed cover. The court had asked the registry to check availability of prospective candidates through the registrar general or other appropriate source.
On Wednesday, the division bench nominated Bhushan, a former judge of M P High Court who retired as Up- Lokayukta in the state recently. Raman, an IPS officer of MP cadre who retired as Special Director, BSF, in 2011 and Reddy, who was also HOD Court Informatics Centre, New Delhi, were appointed as members.
The bench said except the chairman (Bhushan) the other two members don’t ordinarily reside in Bhopal and asked the state government to provide complete logistical assistance to all three members of the SIT and pay emoluments as would be determined by the court.
The court directed the registrar general of M P High Court to ascertain in writing the willingness of the three members to take up the assignment and (expected) emoluments if they desire. The bench listed the matter for issuing further directions on November 17.

The power of teamwork and improvisation in the development of Ampy1
Q. How’d you get to be such a natural pitchman in your Kickstarter video?
A. I am about to graduate from the music conservatory at Second City, and improv has been a huge part of shaping both the way I approach any problem and how I present my product. Improv also has helped me and my teammates approach any problem with that “yes and” attitude. When you do improv, if you accept the “reality” presented to you — like “I’m your mother” — and you contribute to that, it’s the only way to move forward to build the scene. That’s the attitude of complete trust of my teammates. So when we brainstormed for Ampy, it’s that trust that every suggestion can be used in a positive way to move forward that has allowed us to innovate.
Q. How else has improv helped you?
A. Improv has taught me how to listen better to the response of the audience and to really incorporate feedback. In improv, if you’re not listening, you’re not improvising. It’s the same with pitching. You need to be open, receptive and very conscious of how well the audience received every utterance you say and make sure that you’re tuning your presentation to how you think they will best receive it.
We also did improv to create customer empathy personas to understand how the user would interact with the product, like when they’re carrying a baby or wearing a suit. You have to wear the masks of these different characters to understand their problems.
Q. What other startup lessons are you applying as a founder?
A. I’ve learned that having a fantastic team that you work well with is hugely important toward getting a good outcome. We're looking to hire people that can integrate well. It’s the personality type and people skills and also the atmosphere that we set up. We've held a few interviews over beers, for example, because we feel that best matches the relaxed yet serious environment that we've got.
Q&As are edited for length and clarity.

#NokiaStory: 10 Nokia phones India will always rememberPrint
Bye-bye Nokia! Here are 10 all-time favourite Nokia phones, we will always remember.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: November 11, 2014 7:53 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 7:57 pm
For well over a decade, Nokia was synonymous with the mobile phone across most of the world. We loved our old Nokia phones and for most of us it was the first mobile brand. Nokia phones were popular for its reliability, battery life and of course some of the models were good enough to be projectiles.
People loved the fact that a Nokia phone could easily last for over three years. However, this was not something Nokia might have actually wanted, as it lowered the refresh cycle ultimately hampering sales growth.
This is not the story anymore. With smartphones coming into the picture, there is nothing called a single favourite brand in the country. Also, after Microsoft acquired the brand, it is now officially dropping the Nokia tag.
So on the day Microsoft Device announced its first phone, the Lumia 535, to launch without the Nokia branding, we take a look at the 10 all-time favourite Nokia phones.
Did you own any of these handsets? Or, did we just miss your favourite Nokia phone? Feel free to share your #NokiaStory at the comment section below.
Nokia 1100: Launched in 2003, the Nokia 1100 was the world’s best selling handset then.
Nokia 2100: This handset introduced white back light in 2003. Remember? Was priced at around Rs 5000 back then.
Nokia 3110 Classic: Launched in 2007, this handset had 9 MB of internal storage which could be expanded up to 2GB. Wow! Seriously??
Nokia 3230: Launched in 2004. Internet, camera, joystick, large screen, BT, USB port. What are you staring at, huh?
Nokia 3310: Launched in 2000. This handset was literally a life saver -with its great battery life and of course as a weapon!
Nokia 6020: Launched in 2004, this handset became popular among office goers. How many of you bought it for Rs 7,500?
Nokia 6600: Camera, camera, camera! Yes, you could capture videos with this handset. Remember the TV ad?
Nokia 7610: The S shape of this handset was considered sexy back then. Launched in 2004.
Nokia 9500 communicator: Business class. This handset (or any other Communicator model) was seen in TV serials and movies. Launched in 2004.
Nokia N70: Launched in 2005, every teenager back then wanted to buy one. It had dual cameras. What??
Special mention (Number 11) Nokia N-gage: Well, how could you forget this handset? Gaming, dude, mobile gaming!

Builders Liquidity to Improve After Easing of FDI Rules: FitchMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday that easing of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules in the realty sector would improve the liquidity situation of developers and boost supply but could also result in increased price competition among them.
On October 29, the Cabinet had relaxed FDI rules in construction sector by reducing minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms.
"Relaxation of rules on foreign direct investments into India's property development sector, will improve developers' liquidity and speed-up project-turnaround times, but may also increase competition," Fitch Ratings said in a statement.
Key amendments in the FDI ruled include allowing foreign developers to invest in smaller property development projects - with a minimum floor area of 20,000 square metres compared to 50,000 square metres earlier.
The minimum foreign investment threshold was also lowered to $5 million per project from $10 million previously.
"These moves may encourage more foreign developers to tie up with their domestic counterparts, which will improve domestic developers' liquidity and speed up project turnaround times," it added.
On the flipside, Fitch said the relaxed rules will also mean a higher supply of property projects and more price-competition among domestic developers, which will pressure profit margins.
"Thinner margins will reduce the cushion available to developers to cut prices and spur demand during economic downturns."
In a more competitive environment, Fitch noted that factors like developers' track record of executing projects and on-time deliveries will become important differentiators for consumers.
In India, the rating agency said the property projects typically have long gestation periods compared to peers in a number of other Asian markets, resulting in higher leverage and weaker liquidity for most developers.
"Indian developers' average working capital cycles can be as long as five to six years, and with leverage (defined by Fitch as net debt/adjusted inventory) as high as 100 per cent," it added.
Comparatively, most Chinese property firms have average working capital cycles of less than two years, with leverage typically well below 50 per cent.
"Indian developers' limited access to capital compared to Chinese peers, and India's slower approval processes for the purchase and development of land parcels are mostly to blame," the agency noted.

'...each negative review is an opportunity to present your company as honorable and reliable.'
Your first negative online review will feel horrible. And if you have been in a public-facing business for any length of time, it is bound to happen.
Once you recover from the surprise and disappointment of a negative review, it's time to take positive action for your brand. Having a plan in place to handle it can make the difference in how people see your brand and public image. Here are seven steps that can help see you through it:
Stay calm and be patient
8
When you see a negative review, your first step should be getting your emotions under control. Take 10 minutes (or up to a day) to settle your mind and come back to the comment. The worst thing you can do is go in swinging or say something you regret. Try to remember that the review and reply will be public.
Follow your company's policy for negative reviews
If you don't have a policy in place for this, there is no time like the present to establish one. Put your policy in writing and include it in any training and policy manuals so that all employees know the proper procedure when a negative review comes to your attention. Your policy may include elements such as:
How quickly should we respond to the review publicly? Is 24 hours enough time?
Who is in charge of this issue? Assign ownership of brand management and online reviews to someone capable, prepared and responsible enough to handle the duty.
Step 8. Fix the problem that prompted the complaint.
eieio-
1
What is the approved process for addressing the issue? This will vary wildly business to business, but should include politeness, professionalism and an attempt to empathize with the customer's concern.
Have you documented the incident? Record the incident and all steps taken for future records and training if necessary.
Monitor your reviews
Make it a point of emphasis to monitor your reviews. This may be a task delegated to the same individual in charge of handling the business's procedure for negative reviews. Whoever is in charge of this process, you can't address a negative review if you are not aware of it. Follow up on all popular and local review websites, including the Better Business Bureau and Yelp, to stay on top of your online reputation.
Don't take reviews to heart
It is natural to feel angry or at least annoyed by a negative review about your business, particularly if you feel the situation was not at all well-represented by the reviewer. But you cannot change the actions of others — you can only control your response. When it's time to respond, be polite and professional. Replying in an abrasive or defensive manner will only diminish your reputation in the eyes of other customers.
Avoid speculation about the reviewer
There are people out there who will never be satisfied, and you can not always tell who you're dealing with on a review. If you feel strongly that a reviewer is an angry former employee or an irritated party from your personal life who is trying to tear you down publicly, document everything and send a polite email to the company hosting the negative review explaining your case. If you don't get a response there, it's tempting to professionally present the “evidence” online to try and “out” the non-customer, but this should not be your typical response.
Trying to call an online reviewer out without proof will only damage your reputation and make you look a bit foolish. Treat every complaint as though it is sincere.
Refrain from offering a public discount or coupon
This is an easy one to figure out if you're the potential customer: I go to your restaurant, or pretend that I did. I later complain about my experience. Since you typically give other complainers a free meal, I expect to receive one too.
Do not give a reviewer the incentive to give you a bad review. Always try to make it right with a customer, but do not try to mend fences in public. Address the concern publicly and apologize for the experience. Use a private conversation to offer compensation or any future discounts.
Handle issues privately
Moving issues to a private medium such as email or a phone call is far more desirable than in a public forum. Ask the reviewer to contact you directly so that you can discuss the issue and give you an opportunity to make it right. If the reviewer is truly upset, he will call or email.
Everyone who sees your reply to the negative review understands that you've attempted to fix the problem in a professional manner, helping to solidify your brand and reputation again.
When properly handled, each negative review is an opportunity to present your company as honorable and reliable. A reputation for dealing with negative reviews in a productive manner will inspire trust among prospective clients and over time, create new sales opportunities for your firm.

The Choice of the Centuryreddit
The president blames himself for the Democrats' big losses Election Day.
"We have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we're trying to do and why this is the right direction," he said Sunday.
In other words, he didn't sufficiently tout the administration's accomplishments.
I respectfully disagree.
If you want a single reason for why Democrats lost big on Election Day 2014 it's this: Median household income continues to drop .
This is the first "recovery" in memory when this has happened.
Jobs are coming back but wages aren't.
Every month the job numbers grow but the wage numbers go nowhere.
Most new jobs are in part-time or low-paying positions. They pay less than the jobs lost in the Great Recession.
This wageless recovery has been made all the worse because pay is less predictable than ever.
Most Americans don't know what they'll be earning next year or even next month. Two-thirds are now living paycheck to paycheck.
So why is this called a "recovery" at all? Because, technically, the economy is growing.
But almost all the gains from that growth are going to a small minority at the top.
In fact, 100 percent of the gains have gone to the best-off 10 percent. Ninety-five percent have gone to the top 1 percent.
The stock market has boomed. Corporate profits are through the roof. CEO pay, in the stratosphere.
Yet most Americans feel like they're still in a recession.
And they're convinced the game is rigged against them.
Fifty years ago, just 29 percent of voters believed government is "run by a few big interests looking out for themselves."
Now, 79 percent think so.
According to Pew, the percentage of Americans who believe most people who want to get ahead can do so through hard work has plummeted 14 points since 2000.
What the president and other Democrats failed to communicate wasn't their accomplishments.
It was their understanding that the economy is failing most Americans and big money is overrunning our democracy.
And they failed to convey their commitment to an economy and a democracy that serve the vast majority rather than a minority at the top.
Some Democrats even ran on not being Barack Obama.
That's no way to win. Americans want someone fighting for them, not running away from the president.
The midterm elections should have been about jobs and wages, and how to reform a system where nearly all the gains go to the top.
It was an opportunity for Democrats to shine. Instead, they hid.
Consider that in four "red" states -- South Dakota, Arkansas, Alaska, and Nebraska -- the same voters who sent Republicans to the Senate voted by wide margins to raise their state's minimum wage.
Democratic candidates in these states barely mentioned the minimum wage.
So what now?
Republicans, soon to be in charge of Congress, will push their same old supply-side, trickle-down, austerity economics.
They'll want policies that further enrich those who are already rich.
That lower taxes on big corporations and deliver trade agreements written in secret by big corporations.
That further water down Wall Street regulations so the big banks can become even bigger - too big to fail, or jail, or curtail.
They'll exploit the public's prevailing cynicism by delivering just what the cynics expect.
And the Democrats? They have a choice.
They can refill their campaign coffers for 2016 by trying to raise even more money from big corporations, Wall Street, and wealthy individuals.
And hold their tongues about the economic slide of the majority, and the drowning of our democracy.
Or they can come out swinging. Not just for a higher minimum wage but also for better schools, paid family and medical leave, and child care for working families.
For resurrecting the Glass-Steagall Act and limiting the size of Wall Street banks.
For saving Social Security by lifting the cap on income subject to payroll taxes.
For rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges, and ports.
For increasing taxes on corporations with high ratios of CEO pay to the pay of average workers.
And for getting big money out of politics, and thereby saving our democracy.
It's the choice of the century.
Democrats have less than two years to make it.

Some Veterans Need Help -- Thats Our Jobreddit
It's been five years since Jacob Sexton, a soldier with the Indiana National Guard, came home with nightmares after two combat deployments, and on a Monday evening in a movie theater with family and friends, killed himself with a pistol shot. He was 21-years-old.
The story is horrifying, and sadly familiar. On this day, we pause to honor the 21.9 million living Americans who have served in uniform. We might also remember the estimated 8,000 veterans and 475 active duty, reserve and National Guard men and women who took their own lives last year in the ongoing tragedy of military and veteran suicide.
Jacob's death, like the others, could have been prevented. That's the view from Farmland, a hamlet in Indiana's corn and soybean belt where Jacob's parents, Jeff and Barbara Sexton, raised Jacob. Jeff is a short-haul truck driver who's turned his grief into a personal crusade to save others from suicide. This year he helped draft suicide prevention legislation, but the bill, named after his son, remains stalled in Congress. Without a hard push, it is likely that the Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act of 2014 will remain stalled.
But I am coming to believe that suicide prevention should not be left only to government. Sure, the military services and the VA have dramatically improved prevention awareness and mental health services. The Veterans Crisis Line is a marvel of caring and efficient support. Yes, the government still needs to be pushed harder by Congress.
But the best suicide prevention is a friend. Someone who will see the signs of distress and have the gumption to ask: Are you feeling suicidal? And to stay with that person until help comes.
That didn't happen for Jacob Sexton -- Jake, as Jeff and Barbara called him. He enlisted in the Guard at the age of 17 and inside of two years was already home from combat. It was 18 months before he could tell his dad what happened: He'd been a turret gunner on a gun truck, parked at a checkpoint when a car came rocketing along at him, and Jake, minding warnings about vehicle suicide bombers, reacted appropriately.
"He opened fire and when they went to investigate it ended up being a family of four. No weapons. Just a miscommunication," said Jeff. "And that really tore into him, the -- you know, he was the only one who fired so there was no doubt he was the one that caused the ... you know, caused it."
Jake soon deployed again, and came home on leave that fall of 2009. On the Friday before Jake's suicide, he and Jeff were out in the garage talking and another incident came to light. On a heavily trafficked Kabul road, an Afghan driver had rammed Jake's Humvee, and the two got into an altercation. The Afghan punched Jake in the face. Jake told his dad that he shot the guy in the chest with his M-4 carbine. Jake said his superiors wrote it off as self-defense, but his dad could see it bothered him.
"That's not something you come home and brag about," Jeff told me. "That's deep. Deep! That's something that would really bother you ... but then the next couple of days he was fine, back to his cheerful self again."
Three days later, Jake shot himself to death.
Eventually, Jeff spoke with some of Jake's fellow soldiers, and he found something that made him furious. Jake had been struggling quietly with PTSD, anxious and depressed and unable to sleep. But the soldiers didn't notice, or they did notice and didn't know what to do, or they mentioned it to somebody and nothing was done.
A year ago last winter, Jeff heard Joe Donnelly, his new senator , talking about the need for better suicide prevention in the military. Out from Farmland went an email. "Dear Senator Donnelly," Jeff wrote in March 2013, "I'm willing to help in any way I can." The next day, Jeff's phone rang. "This is Joe," a voice said. Eventually, they crafted the legislation encouraging troops to be trained to intervene when someone's in distress.
Meantime, the pain of loss goes on. "They say it gets better," Jeff mused one evening, after he'd run a load of Honda parts down to Columbus, Ohio. "It doesn't."
"My wife and I were both doing therapy, she ended up losing her job over it, she had to take so much time off. Just couldn't deal with it," he said. "Quite honestly, still to this day I've had to have her on a personal suicide watch because she'll turn around and say, 'I just want to see Jacob,' and when she says that I know what she means."
He continues to push the idea that friends are the best prevention. One time recently he talked to a group of National Guard soldiers. "I told 'em flat out, 'If you got a problem or know somebody who does, don't be afraid to speak up.' Well, the first sergeant thanked me, and he told me later he had three guys step up and say they're having problems."
"I said, 'well, that's three less to worry about.'"

Theres G20  and theres B20There’s G20, and there’s B20
CHANDRAJIT BANERJEE
Packs a punch Along with business
At Brisbane, a coalition of businesses will supplement governments’ efforts to free barriers to trade and investment
Later this month, leaders of the G20 group of nations will be meeting in Brisbane to take forward the dialogue on inter-governmental coordination for global growth and development. With business as a vital player in development, the deliberations must include inputs from industry to remain relevant, foster growth and stability, and create the necessary number of jobs.
The G20 formation was launched towards the close of the twentieth century as leaders from 20 major economies came together for closer partnerships. After 2008, the group was reshaped as the principal forum to discuss the global economic crisis and to collectively suggest remedial measures.
A new coalition
It was soon realised that without the participation of private enterprises in policy recommendations, the objective of G20 nations to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth would remain incomplete. As a result, independent business associations from G20 countries formed a coalition named as Business 20 or B20. This coalition bridges governmental agenda with the interests of business communities of G20 nations. It is a representative group of approximately 6.5 million businesses across the world. India is one of the founding members of the B20 Coalition.The B20 represents today’s job creators and it is important that the key priorities identified by it be tackled with strong intent by G20 leaders.
The B20 Coalition calls on the G20 governments to assist the private sector’s efforts, not only through budgetary discipline and redirection of spending towards investment, but also by removing barriers to business activity and improving coordination in key areas such as digital security and tax policy. Recommendations made by B20 Coalition to the G20 dialogue are increasing in number and relevance every year. In recent times, B20 has made recommendations in the areas of employment, human capital, social issues, trade, financial regulation, corruption, sustainable growth and innovation.
In the upcoming meeting, the G20 will be dealing with a global economy which is witnessing uneven growth, below the pace required to generate much needed jobs. While the US and the UK seem to be doing well, growth in the Euro Area still continues to be fragile. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global growth projection for 2014 is 3.3 per cent and reflects both the legacy of the weak first half of the year and a less optimistic outlook for several emerging markets.
Brisbane agenda
It is in this backdrop that the B20 Coalition’s has highlighted four priorities, i.e. trade and investment, fiscal responsibility, energy and infrastructure and investment.
On trade and investment, G20 governments must reach a suitable compromise allowing implementation and ratification of the essentials of the Bali Trade Facilitation Agreement and to provide capacity-building assistance and financial support for developing countries. Additionally, the leaders should work to avoid protectionism and enhance openness on rules as well as on market access.
The energy front will require G20 leaders to commit to the measurement, monitoring, reporting, control and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions under a new ambitious global agreement next year in Paris, for which strong political will be needed. Policymakers also need to increase the role of the private sector in energy.
For most G20 governments, fiscal responsibility is a critical area. Fiscal deficit should be controlled by the establishment of a time-bound deficit reduction plan.
In situations where it is necessary to raise public revenues, it should be done in a manner that does not dampen overall demand or undermine incentives to invest.
In addition, fiscal solutions must preserve the private sector’s capacity to be a source of growth and development.
Regarding infrastructure and investments, there is a need to recapitalise multilateral development banks to fund infrastructure.
By providing a unique link between governments, relevant international institutions and business communities, the B20 Coalition has been instrumental in supporting the G20 process, particularly when it comes to the role that the business community can play. Industry hopes that its recommendations will be addressed by G20 leaders when they meet in Brisbane.

Who makes the cut for top bank jobsWho makes the cut for top bank jobs?
Anil K Khandelwal
No child's play Contemporary banking is different ball game SERGIY BYKHUNENKO/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM
Public sector chiefs must be tested for altogether different skillsets — the sort in vogue in international finance
The recent controversy over the selection process of the chairman and managing director of public sector banks has raised a few pertinent issues. It has brought to the fore bureaucratic dominance and associated political interference influencing the process. Now that the Government proposes to undertake the selection exercise through three sub-committees, as reported in the press, the issue is: Are we going to repeat the same mistakes? There is no doubt the selection process needs overhaul to insulate it from bureaucratic dominance. Considering the sensitive nature of the position of the CEO in PSBs, it will be necessary to improve the credibility of the entire selection process.
The present situation provides an opportunity to revisit and revamp the selection process and methodology. The time is also opportune to move beyond a sectoral view and adopt a holistic approach.
Changing the landscape
We need to look at the emerging role of PSBs in the context of rising aspirations in India. With the country aspiring to become a global economic superpower within the next decade or so, it is quite evident that the nature and characteristics of the banking would undergo sweeping changes. The question that arises is: What kind of banking do we visualise for the country, say by 2025? How different will it be from what we have had in the last few years? What kind of leadership would be suitable for piloting such banks? Assuming that some Indian banks — let’s say three or four — emerge as global banks, what kind of leadership would be best suited to head them?
Along with India’s aspiration to emerge as a global economic superpower, two distinct developments of the recent past can be factored in: ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’. These have implications not only for India’s economy but equally for India’s banking sector.
It is no exaggeration to say that for too long we have been obsessed with an identification and selection process rooted primarily in the belief that a good banker could also fit in as a transformational leader. While traditional domain knowledge and experience would have been good enough thus far, future leaders would need skills in strategic management and transformational leadership.
Open market scouting
The setting has changed, the nature of banking is changing, customers are calling the shots and information technology is making heavy inroads into banking. Different sets of characteristics and attributes would be called for in leaders to head the rapidly transforming banking sector in India. How do we find such leaders? Is the present system for scouting and selecting within the banking sector good enough? What is the source from which we may identify and select such leaders? Should this source be confined to the ‘available basket’ from the banking sector? Or should it be thrown open to a wider market including the government, public and private sectors, apart from the banking sector? What methodology should be adopted to scout and select?
One can argue that for smaller sized banks with domestic banking as core business, domain experience may be both necessary and adequate, but for larger banks with global size and international banking as their core area, leaders could be drawn from any sector. The recent example of Coal India issuing an open advertisement for the post of CMD demonstrates the new approach of the Government.
Selection process and panel
Any exercise to revamp the present system would need to include some major process reforms, as listed below:
(a) In order that the selection is insulated from political and bureaucratic interference (which has apparently led to the current impasse), it is desirable that the selection panel is headed by the Reserve Bank of India governor and he participates in the interview process. This will lend credibility to the process.
(b) The selection panel should comprise professionals such as social scientists, management experts and leading economists. It would also be necessary to clearly enunciate the essential attributes and characteristics required of the candidate. A template could be prepared and provided to the panel.
(c) The panel should have a common understanding of the skill sets required to be evaluated and the methodology for the same.
(d) Sufficient time should be allocated for the interview process.
(e) At least one year of completed service as ED and one cycle of appraisals should be made compulsory.
(f) A 360-degree appraisal can be made mandatory for GMs and this can give added inputs for ED selection. The selection process should aim at evaluating the candidates on factors such as commercial acumen, understanding of emerging trends in domestic and international banking, vision for the future, entrepreneurial and decision-making skills, risk management skills, communication skills, ability to leverage technology, creative problem-solving, and people skills.
The question, however, is whether interview is the only way to evaluate leadership competencies. Ideally, the identified pool for the position should be tested for a variety of leadership skills in an assessment centre, as is the practice in some PSUs.
Data from the centre should be used to make the decision along with performance appraisal reports, experience profile and other relevant information.
Each member on the panel should independently evaluate the suitability of the candidate and pass on the evaluation to the RBI governor.
The fundamental idea is to elevate the process of selection to improve the credibility of the process.
The Khandelwal Committee on HR issues of PSBs had made some recommendations regarding selection and the mechanism for creating future leaders for PSBs. It is time policymakers thought in terms of creating a pipeline of capable leaders to head PSBs in the future, with a long-term perspective of 5-10 years, rather than confining the selection to the ‘available candidates’. The recommendation to set up a Bankers Leadership Development Institute (BLDI) is also worth considering.

Platinum no longer lacks lustre in the SouthPlatinum no longer lacks lustre in the South

Breaking the gold hold, Gen-Next increasingly opts for the precious metal
Mumbai, November 11:  
Like most South Indians, Molly Mathew Joseph grew up partial to gold jewellery. But for her wedding next month, the freelance make-up artist from Kerala will break with family tradition and wear platinum instead of the yellow metal.
“Platinum will go well with my white wedding gown,” said 28-year-old Joseph. “Also, I like the sleek designs that are available in platinum.” Her husband-to-be will also wear a platinum band and bracelet.
It’s not just this couple, many young consumers in South India are increasingly opting for platinum over gold. This has made the South the largest market for the rare metal in India.
Gold myth
According to London-based Platinum Guild, about 50 per cent of overall sales in the country comes from the southern market, breaking the myth about South Indians’ obsession for the yellow metal.
“South India loves anything in the purest form whether it is gold, platinum or diamond,” said Nicholas Graham Smith, CEO of Platinum Guild International. Also contributing to the changing tastes are rising income levels and increased exposure to global fashion trends. “Even jewellery retailers have expanded their platinum segment, sensing growing demand from young consumers who like to wear platinum to work,” said Smith. Youngsters in the 15-30 age-group account for 85 per cent of platinum consumers.
He said the trend will soon catch up in other parts of the country. Platinum Guild in its first ‘Retail Trade Barometer’ found out that platinum in India, despite a slow market, is the fastest growing category in the jewellery sector, witnessing a strong growth of over 41 per cent in 2013. The Guild expects similar growth this year too. 
Societal change
In the past two decades, social, economic and demographic changes have influenced Indian culture. Besides, the growth in the number of nuclear families is also bringing about a change in tradition.  Wedding celebrations have become more elaborate.
The Guild recently launched a bridal collection in the country and expects the Indian market to become the second-largest in the next five years. Currently, India consumes about four tonnes of platinum compared with 760 tonnes of gold and is the fourth-largest market globally after China, Japan and the US.
Platinum Guild is also looking at investing heavily in advertising and promotion through television campaigns next year to drive sales. Platinum is available across 800 stores, in the top 30 cities and is expanding across Tier-II cities as well.

Medical Marijuana Is Going to Be Big Business... Shortlyreddit
There are currently only seven people in the U.S. that can legally use marijuana under federal law, and they all receive cannabis cigarettes direct from the Federal government.
Those seven are the benefactors of a lawsuit filed by Robert Randall in 1978 when he sued the Federal government a second time for using cannabis to treat his glaucoma. A Federal judge twice ruled in favor of Randall and directed the Food and Drug Administration to set up a program at the University of Mississippi to grow and distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to him.
The Federal government's medical marijuana program continued until 1992 when President Bush discontinued it over concerns the program would need to expand dramatically in order to help AIDS patients. Since then, only seven people have retained the rights to consume marijuana legally under Federal law.
Fortunately, a new breed of biopharmaceutical companies are seeking Federal approval to deliver the medical benefits of cannabis without having to smoke or ingest the plant the plant.  GW Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: GWPH), AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), INSYS Therapeutics (NASDAQ: INSY) and Cara Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CARA) are among the most well-known.
And this week, NEMUS BioScience, Inc. (OTC: LGLRD) joined the foray by announcing its exclusive partnership with University of Mississippi (UM) for the further development and, if approved, commercialization of cannabis-derived products called cannabinoids that the university has been developing.  NEMUS has entered into several license and research agreements with UM granting the company worldwide rights to the university's patents, formulations of the cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and several smoke-free delivery methods, including eyes drops.
When Robert Randall developed glaucoma in his teens in the early 1970s, an ophthalmologist told him that he would go blind within a few years. But Randall never lost his sight because he claimed cannabis lowered the pressure in his eyes and thus prolonged his ability to see.
Today, according to the National Eye Institute , over 2.7 million people in the U.S. have glaucoma but only half of those know it.  It's not curable, and once lost, vision cannot be regained. "That's not acceptable," NEMUS CEO John Hollister told me,. "Cannabis has been shown in some studies to have benefits in the treatment of glaucoma by lowering pressure within the eye, but, because the existing approaches relied on systemic exposure, there can be unwanted negative consequences.  That's why we are creating a new approach and treatment that allows for the delivery of drug by eye drops to multiple chambers of the eye resulting in absorption just where it's needed and will lower the pressure within the eye."
Hollister's strategy is based on a key research finding: traditional means of consuming cannabinoids (smoking or oral) for medical indications, can have significant bioavailability issues. NEMUS' Chief Medical Officer, Brian Murphy, M.D. explains, "Like other drugs, cannabis effects can vary from person-to-person based upon absorption and metabolism, resulting in no therapeutic impact and/or causing toxic side effects - that's why we're developing a drug pipeline of cannabinoid formulations, starting with Glaucoma, that deliver specific in what we anticipate will be a more predictable and safer way, compared to ingesting cannabis either orally or through inhalation."
But how do we know NEMUS's assumptions are right?  Do we really need to pharmaceuticalize cannabis? It's a new question that will undoubtedly be debated in the next few years, but one powerful voice has already weighed in. Doctor Sanjay Gupta who was vehemently opposed to cannabis for medical reasons has recently switched positions after studying the issue, "There are very legitimate medical applications. In fact, sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works. We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and I apologize for my own role in that."
From a distance, most people still view Cannabis as an illegal drug for hippies, drug addicts, or tuned out college students. But technology is allowing companies like NEMUS to fine tune the plant to focus on a legitimate and effective medicinal purpose that has been shown to help patients with Spasticity associated with Multiple Sclerosis and epilepsy.
Investors, of course, are paying attention and are lining up to invest in these companies. According to a recent survey by Investing.com , Mentor Capital and Forbes, 73 percent of investors and 60 percent of financial analysts are bullish about the potential to invest in cannabis-derived pharmaceutical companies.
According to another survey by GreenWave Advisors , (link opens a pdf), the medical marijuana industry will skyrocket to a $35 billion industry if the federal government changes its stance on the drug which is now considered a schedule 1 drug . That has many investors and analysts studying companies like NEMUS because the medical marijuana market is in its infancy and its potential upside is unlimited.
Robert Randall died in 2001 having never lost his eyesight. He never achieved his goal of legalizing cannabis for medicinal purposes. Still, in the next five years, and as the general public has become more accepting of cannabis and technology enables companies to develop cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals, we may see Randall's dream come true.
The question is: who, how and in what manner?

Shiv Sena slams BJP over NCP support  likens Sharad Pawar s party to mouseLetters to  the editor
Firing a fresh salvo ahead of Maharashtra BJP government’s trust vote today, Shiv Sena has warned its former ally that it will be disrespecting people’s mandate if it takes support of NCP which “nibbled the state coffers like a mouse”.
“(Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra) Fadnavis once said that he wants to run the government for the people. But how do you plan to run the government taking support of a party that has been discarded by the people of the state?
“Will you win the trust vote taking support of a party which has nibbled at the state coffers like a mouse? Will you take support of a mouse?”, the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
Taunting its former ally, the party said the BJP is ready to take Sena’s support to save face during the trust vote, but is unrelenting on carrying forward talks regarding Sena’s role in the state government.
“BJP asks us to give it support on the basis of similar ideologies and principles. You (BJP) also know that the ideology of NCP is only to loot Maharashtra,” it alleged.
“But you (BJP) have nothing to do with that? You are ready to take their unconditional support,” the Sena said while asking the BJP “on whose tunes it plans to dance now”.
It is a strange scenario where the party with largest mandate is joining hands with a party that fared badly during the recent Assembly elections, the Sena said.
“Why was the NCP thrown to the fourth position this time? What kind of principles does the BJP talk about when it agrees to take support of a party which was relegated to the fourth position by the people,” it said.
“Saving the government is the only priority of BJP, for which it will also take support of the MIM which is working towards vitiating the minds of people,” the Sena alleged.

Obamacare and gay marriage  the missing linkBy Dale Carpenter November 12
Now that a critical part of the Affordable Care Act is before the Supreme Court in King v. Burwell we can expect to see many efforts to steer the outcome from both sides in popular media, legal blogs, and briefs. A lot of these attempts will be aimed at the interesting and complex legal issues involved, but others will not be.
On Tuesday, Harvard law professor Noah Feldman  speculated in a blog post  about a possible “linkage” between the pending ACA case and a likely same-sex marriage case this Term. Not that he asserts any linkage in the facts, legal issues, or background principles, which would be a fascinating read. But he sees a linkage by which the Supreme Court may give itself psychological permission to reach a “conservative” policy result in one case (against the ACA) by balancing it against a “liberal” result in the other (for same-sex marriage). The post is entitled, “Obamacare May Die So Gay Marriage Survives.” Feldman may not have written the title but it doesn’t really mislead the reader about the substance.
I have a great deal of respect for Professor Feldman, who’s clearly a star of his generation in the legal academy. Indeed, I assign my Constitutional Law students the casebook he co-authors. But the conjecture in his BloombergView post is unpersuasive on its own terms and reflects a dismaying trend in constitutional-law writing: a hyper-legal-realism that is neither legal nor very real.
One can fully accept that political allegiances and the Supreme Court’s own desire to preserve the perception of its legitimacy, which is itself a form of politics, can influence its decisions. But Feldman’s approach calls on us to examine the deep and hidden psychological motivations of the Justices–which he agrees they would deny publicly and privately–without even considering whether there are perfectly reasonable and defensible legal grounds for the way they may rule in a particular case.
Here’s how the claim is introduced:
How does linkage work at the Supreme Court? To begin with, recognize that today’s justices never speak in terms of horsetrading or logrolling from one case to another. I don’t just mean that, when asked publicly if justices might trade votes to support causes held dear by one-another, they all deny it. I mean that, even within the court itself or in private conversation with clerks and confidants, the justices would almost certainly say that no such linkage exists. Denial of linkage across unrelated cases is a kind of justices’ dogma — it would be sacrilegious, not to say heretical, for court insiders to say otherwise.
Nevertheless, linkage may exist at the level of psychology — and the justices know it.
To support this psychological-linkage speculation, Feldman offers the example of Justice Stevens’s votes in 2008 agreeing with the five conservatives in a death penalty and international-law decision (Medellin v. Texas) while at the same time voting to apply constitutional-rights protections to prisoners at Guantánamo Bay (Boumediene v. Bush).
What explains Stevens’s votes? The cases presented very different factual backgrounds and distinct constitutional questions about the status of international law, executive authority, and federalism. But Feldman analyzes none of this, instead asserting: “Stevens did not want Justice Anthony Kennedy to be subject to the criticism that he had provided the deciding conservative vote in the Medellin decision and the deciding liberal vote in the Guantánamo case.” So he voted to protect Kennedy by giving him added support in a conservative decision, thereby securing his vote for a liberal decision in a different case. Feldman does not tell us what the basis is for thinking Stevens might have had this latent psychological motivation–sacrificing his own judicial integrity and legacy against his better liberal judgment–to protect Kennedy’s right flank.
Feldman then applies this mode of speculation to the prospective votes of Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts in the coming ACA case, which challenges on statutory grounds the IRS tax credits being made available to those who purchase health insurance on federally created exchanges. Since Feldman believes Justice Kennedy’s vote for gay marriage is almost certain, he asserts that Kennedy may vote to strike down the ACA in order “to try to maintain his conservative bona fides with a corresponding conservative decision.” He adds: “If you believe that Kennedy will decide in favor of gay marriage — and I do — then it seems almost guaranteed that he will vote with the conservatives against the Barack Obama administration in the new Affordable Care Act case.”
Feldman adds that “some speculated” that Kennedy’s liberal vote in United States v. Windsor  in 2013 may have been linked to his conservative vote to strike down the ACA’s individual mandate in NFIB v. Sebelius a year earlier. Apparently, psychological-linkage speculation can explain not only the Justices’ votes across ideological divides but can enrich our understanding of why a Justice votes one way in one case while other unrelated cases are still “wending their way” to the Court to provide a future balancing vote.
As for Roberts, whichever way he votes in the gay-marriage case, Feldman is ready to pounce on his possible vote to  strike down the ACA tax credit. Roberts, of course, was the saving vote for the ACA’s individual mandate two years ago. Feldman asserts that Roberts’s vote against the ACA now will be an attempt to balance the ledger against a high-profile liberal legal victory for gay marriage with at least one high-profile conservative win this Term. This stratagem will also be part of a cunning attempt by Roberts to discredit potential liberal critics of the Court, according to Feldman:
Imagine that, in the space of a few days at the end of June, the court decides a landmark case in favor of gay rights and then says that the IRS can’t give subsidies to citizens of states that have created their own health-insurance exchanges [sic, the tax credit would be ended for those purchasing on the federal exchange]: What liberal critic would be able to say with a straight face that this was the most conservative activist court in history? The court would be activist, all right, but it would appear almost evenhandedly so.
It never enters the analysis that a Justice could, for reasons entirely apart from personal vanity or institutional strategy, view the cases as presenting quite distinct questions of fact and law. One case presents serious constitutional questions, the other raises multi-faceted statutory-interpretation issues. One challenges state laws, the other attacks a federal law. One involves a claimed need to defer to democratic decisionmaking, the other involves a claimed need to defer to agency interpretation. A Justice’s vote on whether the “equal protection of the laws” requires states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples hardly predetermines his or her vote on the question whether a statutory tax credit for individual health-insurance purchases in markets created “by the State” also includes a tax credit for such purchases in a market created by the federal government.
For Feldman, the obvious distinctions don’t appear to matter. On this view, the conservative votes to strike down the ACA tax credit this Term would be the barely concealed psychological by-product of shrewd politics, legacy building, and institutional protection rather than legal principle. The liberal votes for the ACA tax credit and for same-sex marriage will presumably be matters of constitutional principle, justice, and the American way.
There is almost no decision in the Court’s history that could not be explained by reverting to this crude and non-falsifiable psychological-linkage theory about why the Court issues some decisions favoring liberal policy and some decisions favoring conservative policy. Maybe Kennedy voted to uphold Roe v. Wade in Planned Parenthood v. Casey so that he could later feel ok about voting to strike down part of the Voting Rights Act and the Michigan affirmative-action policy. Maybe Justice Breyer supported the Ten Commandments display in Van Orden v. Perry so he wouldn’t appear anti-religious when he later voted against the city council prayer in Town of Greece v. Galloway. Maybe Justice Scalia’s votes to strike down the flag-burning law in Texas v. Johnson (against a dissent from the devious Justice Stevens) and to reject the military detentions in Hamdi (joined by the same wily Stevens) helped him feel better about his votes in, well, just about every other case. Perhaps the Court apologized for Bush v. Gore by striking down sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas. 
Law professors have no particular expertise for concocting such speculation, unrooted as it is to any consideration of the actual legal issues presented in the cases. Instead, whatever you think of the merits of the challenge to the ACA tax credit, this sort of critique is a fairly obvious preemptive political strike on any decision overturning it. If one can be allowed speculation about psychology for a moment, maybe the theory is that at least one of the conservatives on the Court can be embarrassed into saving Obamacare.

BJP no longer a North Indian party in Tamil Nadu: P Muralidhar RaoPrint
Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:01 pm
Setting an ambitious target of winning more than 122 seats in the next assembly elections in 2016, senior BJP leader P Muralidhar Rao said BJP will occupy the political vacuum in Tamil Nadu. Observing the state politics and its transitional phase, Rao said people in the state are now feeling suffocated under the rule of DMK and AIADMK.
At a time when top leaders of both parties are caught up in major scams and charges of corruption, he said, BJP will take up the role of opposition in Tamil Nadu, from Kanyakumari to Chennai. “We are no longer a North Indian party here. Unlike UPA, we fight for the cause of Tamil fishermen and the rights of Sri Lankan Tamils too. Major challenge before us is to expand the party and we are already successful in that effort under the leadership of new state chief Tamilisai Soundararajan,” Rao said, referring her to the most powerful state women chief after Vasundhara Raje.
Rao is in the city as part of the party general council meeting being held here.

MFs  Exposure to Bank Stocks Surges to Rs 63 000 Crore in OctoberNifty Set to Resume Record Rally Next Week, May Scale 8,600
New Delhi: Mutual fund managers raised their exposure in bank stocks to an all-time high of nearly Rs 63,000 crore in October this year amid a rally in the stock market.
The move comes after fund managers dropped their investment levels in bank stocks in September, after raising it for seven consecutive months.
According to the latest data available with Securities and Exchange Board of India, MF investments in bank stocks as on October 31 surged to Rs 62,718 crore, accounting for 19.91 per cent of the total equity assets under management (AUMs) of Rs 3.15 lakh crore.
The previous high was in August this year when investment in the sector climbed to Rs 56,625 crore.
In comparison, the MF industry's exposure to banking sector stood at Rs 55,398 crore in September this year.
MFs had been raising their exposure to banking shares since January.
Software was the second most preferred sector with MFs last month with an exposure of Rs 32,838 crore, followed by pharma (Rs 21,845 crore), auto (Rs 20,282 crore) and finance (Rs 17,843 crore).
Mutual funds are investment vehicles made up of a pool of funds collected from a large number of investors. MFs invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
According to market participants, MFs have been showing interest in banking stocks since the beginning of the year amid rising equity market.
They believe that the ongoing market rally might see mutual fund assets getting diversified.

Sensex up 99 pts  closes above 28 000-mark for first time; Nifty ends at new peak of 8 383FPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
The BSE Sensex today closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions.
It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points. It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in yesterday’s trade.
A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours today, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 pc), Bajaj Auto (2.10 pc), HDFC Ltd (1.12 pc), SBI (0.17 pc), ICICI Bank (1.33 pc), HDFC Bank (0.44 pc), ITC Ltd (1.55 pc), Bharti Airtel (0.64 pc), BHEL (0.88 pc), Coal India (0.10 pc), Dr Reddy (0.58 pc), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 pc), Tata Motors (1.71 pc) and TCS (0.55 pc).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.
Indian shares hit record highs before CPI data
(Reuters) Indian shares touched record highs for the second time this week as rate-sensitive stocks such as Axis Bank rose on hopes easing inflation would prompt the central bank to cut interest rates earlier than expected.
Consumer inflation in October, due at 5:30 p.m. (1200 GMT), is expected to have eased to a record low of 5.80 percent, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, according to a Reuters poll.
If the forecast is met, it would also make the central bank’s inflation targets – 8 percent by January 2015 and 6 percent a year later – appear more attainable.
“The market is expecting inflation to come down very fast. So if the rates are not cut then certainly some momentum will be lost,” said Vinod Nair, head of fundamental research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd.
The benchmark BSE index closed 0.35 percent up, after earlier rising as much as 0.78 percent to an all-time high of 28,126.48.
The broader NSE index rose 0.25 percent after earlier gaining as much as 0.63 percent to a record high of 8,415.05.
Rate-sensitive stocks led, with Axis Bank rising 3.1 percent and ICICI Bank ending 1.3 percent higher.
Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 1.7 percent and HDFC Bank  advanced 0.4 percent.     Among non-banking lenders, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd surged 7.5 percent, while LIC Housing Finance ended 4.1 percent higher.
Some auto stocks also rose. Two-wheeler manufacturers Bajaj Auto gained 2 percent, Hero MotoCorp ended 1.5 percent higher, while car maker Maruti Suzuki India  gained 0.9 percent.
Tata Motors also advanced 2 percent on optimism ahead of its September-quarter earnings on Friday.
Tyre shares rose as investors expect falling crude oil and rubber price to boost companies’ margins.
Apollo Tyres gained 3.2 percent, JK Tyre and Industries rose 3.1 percent and Ceat Ltd  ended 6.6 percent higher.
Bayer CropScience ended up 10.2 percent after earlier marking its all-time high of 2,749 rupees after its September-quarter profit growth bucked the trend of weak earnings at rivals.
Among decliners, consumer goods stocks fell on worries that higher-than-expected good and services tax (GST) may restrict profit growth. Media reports on Wednesday said a government panel suggested GST rate of 27 percent.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd HLL.NS&gt; fell 0.3 percent and Marico Ltd lost 1.7 percent.

Absence of treaties with tax havens blocking black money fightAbsence of treaties with tax havens blocking black money fight

Black Money
(Probe agencies, including…)
NEW DELHI: Absence of criminal legal treaties between India and tax haven nations have been cited by probe agencies working in the SIT on black money as one of the major impediments in initiating steps to bring back illegal funds stashed abroad by Indians.
These agencies, including the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, have made these challenges known to the SIT in a report after which the high-powered panel has begun preparing an action plan to be communicated to the government for action in this regard, official sources said.
The report, accessed by PTI, says at present India has 37 Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties or Multilateral Assistance Treaties with about 37 countries which does not include "many of the tax havens like Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Bermuda, Malta, British Virgin Islands and others" where a number of suspect black money probes are being conducted by Indian investigative agencies.
"The Special Investigation Team on black money is expected to soon send a report to the government in this regard with a request to ink MLATs with tax haven nations and all other jurisdictions important from the point of financial and tax evasion investigations," sources privy to the development said.
To impress upon the difficulty faced by agencies the report cited two incidents of last year, where tax sleuths were not able to "attach and recover the money in foreign bank accounts in the UK and Singapore through the Ministry of Home Affairs and CBI" as the existing treaties like Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), Tax Information Exchange Treaty (TIEA) and those framed by global economic body OECD were not helpful.
These treaties, sources said, provide for only collection of documents and does help in attachment or restraint of funds or assets of a suspect black money holder to India.
"Thus, in a number of black money cases the Indian agencies are not being able to recover or repatriate these funds lying in foreign countries or bank accounts abroad for recovery of tax demands under domestic laws," they said.
When such cases are under investigation there is no tax demand raised on them or penalty notices issued by a court and hence Indian agencies are not able to lay their hands on such suspected offenders.
"The MLAT does not need this. If there is convincing proof, Indian agencies can block these funds or accounts easily," they said.
The report also said "most of the tax haven countries-- where most of the foreign funds of Indians are reported or alleged to be stashed-- have not ratified or brought into force the Multilateral Convention of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)."
Hence, this instrument is also not helpful for India in such cases even as the clamour to get back black money is being made for long now, they said.
  "The SIT has been apprised about these developments and diplomatic channels will be activated to get the ratification of OECD framed treaties done by these countries on-board the model global convention," they said.
The SIT has been constituted by the Supreme Court and notified by the government with a specific purpose to unearth black money, curb its menace, strengthen mechanisms to check it and investigate all such cases where Indians have stashed illegal funds or assets overseas.
The panel, headed by retd Supreme Court judge M B Shah with justice (retd) Arijit Pasayat as its Vice-Chairman, has heads or officers of 11 central investigative and enforcement agencies on its board.

Twin treat: September IIP at 2.5%; October CPI dips to 5.52%Right time to cut interest rates? September IIP recovers to 2.5%; October CPI dips to 5.52%

consumer price index
(A 2.55% decline in car sales…)
NEW DELHI: Industrial production growth picked up marginally in September to a three-month high and consumer inflation fell to record low, yet few would be willing to risk a wager on Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan cutting interest rates next month to stimulate the economy despite voices calling on him to do just that.
Industrial growth recovered to a better-than-expected 2.5% in September from less than half-a-per cent in August, data released by the statistics office on Wednesday showed, lifted by the high growth in usually volatile capital goods. The separately released consumer price index (CPI) showed retail inflation slowed further to 5.52% in October, another low on the gauge that was launched in 2011, because of softer food and fuel prices.
Inflation is likely to head even lower with international crude prices falling further and the winter vegetable crop likely to push prices down, but growth indicators suggest consumer demand is still weak and the festival season has not provided any cheer.
Most experts think it's the right time to cut rates but expect Rajan to keep them unchanged well into 2015 even at the risk of friction with the new government that would look to an easier monetary policy stance to help strengthen the prospects of recovery after two years of growth below 5%. "Declining retail inflation is a very good sign. Though it is the right time for RBI to cut rates, it does not seem that it will, and will rather wait for some more time," said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings.
RBI has set a target of bringing inflation down to 8% by January 2015 and 6% by January 2016 and has talked of breaking the back of inflation once and for all, rather than relenting too early in the war on prices. Some experts only expect Rajan to move on this front after the budget in February when a clearer picture emerges of the government's finances.
 
"In CPI, the 8% target by January 2015 is distinctly achievable and may touch 7% by March 2015," said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor, State Bank of India. "Inflationary expectations will take a while to come down, so the central bank will not take the risk of cutting rates but may go for a bigger cut when it feels the trend is sustainable." Rajan has left the key repo rate unchanged at 8% since January, when he had raised it by 25 basis points. The next monetary policy announcement will be on December 2.
Markets are piling on the pressure for a rate cut with bond yields heading lower while sluggish credit offtake has forced some banks to cut deposit rates. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has favoured a cut in interest rates in the face of moderating inflation. At the World Economic Forum's India Economic Summit in Delhi last week, a number of industrialists called for lower interest rates. The Confederation of Indian Industry said on Wednesday that it hoped the decline in inflation "would propel RBI to reduce policy rates in its forthcoming monetary policy especially as consumer demand continues to be tepid," adding that growth is showing early signs of revival.
Available evidence shows the economy possibly slowed in September from ninequarter high GDP growth of 5.7% in the April-June quarter. Industrial growth has been low in the second quarter of FY15 — 0.41% in July, 0.48% in August and 2.5% in September. Excise collections are down 1.2% in April-October from the year earlier, suggesting very weak manufacturing. Overall, indirect tax collections are up only 5.6% in this period.
Production of consumer durables contracted 11.3% in September, suggesting weak demand in the face of high interest rates and a lower rise in income. A 2.55% decline in car sales in October suggests the marginal recovery in September industrial production may not be sustained. India Ratings has already trimmed its FY15 growth forecast to 5.6% from 5.7%, citing weaker industrial growth.
"GDP growth is estimated to decline to 5.0% in Q2 from 5.7% in Q1, on the back of factors such as an unfavourable kharif harvest, sluggish manufacturing performance, slowdown in export growth and moderation in the pace of expansion of central government spending," said Aditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA. Manufacturing activity grew by 2.5% during the month, led mainly by the capital goods sector, which posted 11.6% growth after two straight months of contraction. Output in only seven out of 22 sub-sectors contracted in September.
"Capital goods uptick was partly due to the negative base effect and partly on account of projects cleared by the government," said Sabnavis of CARE Ratings. Even declining inflation and the festive season, which usually sees people loosening their wallets, could not revive consumer spending, as evidenced by consumer durables output dropping 11.3%.
Mining grew 0.7% in September and is expected to get better in the coming months based on the government's action plan to auction the 214 cancelled coal blocks and an ordinance to allow commercial mining. This, in turn, will also have a positive effect on manufacturing and electricity. Electricity output rose 3.9% during the month. "The infrastructure sector seems to be rebounding," said Ghosh of SBI. "The capital cycle is expected to revive, after which consumer demand will improve with a lag."
Retail food inflation slowed to 5.59% in October from 7.67% in September while vegetables saw a 1.45% deflation. The fuel price inflation eased further to 3.29%. Another cut in fuel prices is expected, the seventh for petrol since June and the third for diesel since its decontrol on October 18. Wholesale inflation, which touched a five-year-low of 2.38% in September, may slow further in October.

Tata Steel’s total income declined to Rs 35,777 crore in the second quarter of 2014-15, from Rs 36,645 crore a year earlier. Its expenses also fell to Rs 33,564 crore from Rs 34,384 crore a year earlier.
Total tax expenses of the company, however, rose to Rs 1,175 crore from Rs 447 crore a year earlier.
Last March, Tata Steel Board had declared Oberoi Realty as the highest bidder of the auction on the basis of their final bid of Rs 1,155 crore. The conclusion of the deal took time for obtaining requisite permissions.

BJP govt in Maharashtra wins trust voteLetters to  the editor
The 13-day-old BJP government headed by Devendra Fadnavis today won the confidence motion in Maharashtra Assembly by a voice vote, amid protests by former ally Shiv Sena.
As the motion seeking vote of confidence in the BJP government moved by MLA Ashish Shelar was passed in the House where the ruling party is in minority, Shiv Sena MLAs stormed the Well seeking division of votes.
“The motion has been passed,” Speaker Haribhau Bagade announced in the din.
Agitated members of Shiv Sena, which had earlier said that it will oppose the trust vote and and had demanded that its leader Eknath Shinde be accorded the status of Leader of Opposition, shouted slogans.
The Speaker later also announced appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.
Earlier in the day, Bagde was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly after Congress and Shiv Sena withdrew their candidates from the race.
The Speaker had said he would take up the issue of Sena’s demand for LoP’s post after the trust vote as Congress had also staked claim and he would have to study the legal implications. Congress had demanded LoP’s post on the ground that Sena continued to be a constituent of BJP-led NDA.
After Sena members objected to the passing of the trust motion by a voice vote and sought division, Bagde adjourned the House.
When proceedings resumed, the Speaker announced appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.

4th UK-India Science and Innovation Council
(Vardhan said the programme…)
NEW DELHI: India and the UK today announced setting up of a 50 million-pound Newton-Bhabha Fund which will be used for multi-disciplinary cooperation in the fields of science, research and innovation between the two countries.
Minister for Science and Technology Harsh Vardhan said the programme aims to provide financial assistance to the best minds from both the countries in carrying out scientific research and innovation.
"Scientists, academicians, research scholars and administrators from both the countries have come forward to undertake joint-research activities for developing a scientific temper among the people.
"Newton-Bhabha Fund is a tribute to the famous icons of Homi J Bhabha and Sir Issac Newton from both the lands. The programme aims to provide 50 million pounds to the best minds of both the countries in addressing the global challenges through the application of science and technology," Vardhan said.
Delegates from both the countries deliberated on various issues at a meetimg of the 4th UK-India Science and Innovation Council and decided to go for joint PHD student mobility programme, new research projects in mental health and substance abuse among others.
"I hope this exciting new programme will deliver as much to global science as Newton and Bhabha. By working together to address big societal challenges, like sustainable cities, health, food, energy and water, the UK and India can deliver tangible benefits for our countries and the world," Rt Hon Greg Clark MP, British Minister for Universities, Science and Cities, said.
Calling the initiative as a "boon to young researchers", Vardhan said such efforts go a long way in encouraging students to take up science seriously.
"We are working on numerous student exchange programmes between the countries so that best of both the countries can be shared. Such initiatives help young researchers to pursue science with a new vigour," he said.
On being asked about his change of ministry in the recent Cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Vardhan said that he will always remain close to science and technology.
"I have always associated myself with science and technology. I am satisfied with my present ministry as I feel there is scope for doing more here. We will work towards making a cohesive environment for the scientists to work in the country," he said.

By Thomas Heath, The Washington Post
MapQuest users plug-in to roadside assistance with Urgent.ly app, which lets you track the location of help.
Like Uber and taxis, Urgent.ly roadside assistance app competes with traditional help from AAA and others.
Need roadside help? Use a new app to find and track the nearest repair center.
WASHINGTON — Urgent.ly, an online mobile application that allows stranded drivers to summon car repair help, is partnering with MapQuest in a deal that aims to disrupt the $10 billion roadside assistance industry much as Uber has done to the taxi and car service business.
The alliance, announced Nov. 11, allows MapQuest users to use Urgent.ly to summon help to repair a flat tire, fix a dead battery or get the vehicle towed.
Whether you are a new, young driver or someone who has never owned a car before, learning the basics of car care makes both driving and ownership more fun. Even veteran car owners should be familiar with the basics. ( Bob Weber, Special to the Tribune )
Both companies are based in Dulles, Virginia. MapQuest is an AOL property and Urgent.ly is a start-up founded in 2013 and run by several former AOL executives.
"MapQuest is one of the premiere mapping services in the U.S., and has more than 40 million users nationwide. Integrating with MapQuest allows Urgent.ly to scale quickly by providing our innovative on-demand roadside assistance service to their millions of users across the country," said Urgent.ly chief executive Chris Spanos, who once was general manager for AOL's local business.

The service will work this way: After receiving vehicle information and a description of the problem from a MapQuest user, Urgent.ly zeroes in on the driver's location and connects the stranded motorist to a nearby service provider. Users can track the service provider's progress on a map, along with its estimated time of arrival. The MapQuest customer then pays for the service on site with a credit card.
MapQuest's 44.4 million users will now be able to tap a "roadside assistance" button on the MapQuest menu bar, connecting them to Urgent.ly without going through a separate application.
"Using Urgent.ly and its upfront, flat-rate pricing, you will have an estimate on cost and answers to where and when the assistance will arrive." - Urgent.ly chief executive Chris Spanos
Urgent.ly and its new partner said they are aiming to tap into the 200 million drivers on U.S. roads who experience 100 million roadside "events" per year. The American Automobile Association, which has 53 million members, services 29 million calls for service per year.
Urgent.ly estimated there are roughly 30 million potential roadside customers who currently search online through a mobile phone to find help, according to Spanos.
"The whole thing now is if you search on your phone, and you find Joe's Towing listed, you have no idea if he is near you, open, available, capable and how much he is going to charge," Spanos said. "Using Urgent.ly and its upfront, flat-rate pricing, you will have an estimate on cost and answers to where and when the assistance will arrive."
Prior to launching Urgent.ly, Spanos, 45, founded SeniorChecked, a network of pre-screened local businesses for seniors and their families. SeniorChecked was acquired in 2011 by NEWAsurion, a company that provides insurance and services for mobile phones and other products.
Urgent.ly received $525,000 in March from BluVentures and CIT GAP Funds, which is Virginia's technology fund. Urgent.ly has been live in Washington for several months, testing its service among several thousand users.

Furious Congressmen  injure  Maharashtra governorLetters to  the editor
Protesting legislators of Congress caused “injury” to Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao on the first day of the session today when they tried to block his entry into the legislature complex here, revenue minister Eknath Khadse said.
Speaking in the Assembly, Khadse said Congress legislators Rahul Bondre, Amar Kale, Ranjit Kamble, Vijay Wadettiwar and Abdul Sattar “caused injuries” to two legislature officials as well as the Governor.
Khadse said he wanted to move a resolution suspending these members for unruly behaviour.
“Governor’s left hand was injured. The issue does not end with an apology. This should not be tolerated,” Khadse said.
Congress leader in the House Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said there was no intention to cause hurt to anyone, but he would apologise.
NCP MLAs Ajit Pawar, R R Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, however, said the issue should be put to the rest with the apology if the report of Governor getting hurt was true.
Today is the first day of the new legislative Assembly and it should not start on a bitter note, the NCP leaders said.
BJP MLA Girish Mahajan said he was an eyewitness to the incident and it was a condemnable development.
Speaker Haribhau Bagde then adjourned the House for 30 minutes to discuss the issue with group leaders.

PM Modi to meet Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang tomorrowPrint

PM Narendra Modi will have his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang on Thursday afternoon on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit here.
Li was the first foreign leader to have spoken with Modi on the telephone following his swearing-in in May, with the two sharing a 30-minute telephone call. The Chinese prime minister had reportedly pledged then to build a “robust” relationship with the new NDA government.
Li is second-ranked in the Communist Party of China (CPC) after President Xi Jinping and as Premier, Li holds the reins of the Chinese economy and has a more direct role in executing policy as the head of the Chinese State Council or Cabinet.
Although President Xi’s India visit in September was seen as having been somewhat overshadowed by the stand-off in Chumar along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the positives from the visit included the $20 billion investment pledge from China and steps to move forward agreements such as the setting up of China-dedicated industrial parks in India.
Beijing and New Delhi have clashed over relations with the neighbours in recent weeks, with China expressing concern over India’s naval plans with Vietnam, while India has cited worries over the docking of a Chinese submarine at the Colombo harbour.
Apart from Li, Modi is slated to meet Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the new President of Indonesia Joko Widodo and the Prime Minister of Laos at the sidelines of the East Asia Summit on Thursday.

Suspended Congress MLAs deny injuring Maharashtra GovernorThe suspended Congress MLAs alleged that the entire episode was a "conspiracy" by the BJP government.

All five suspended Congress members of Maharashtra Assembly denied causing injury to Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao on Wednesday and alleged that the entire episode was a “conspiracy” by the BJP government.
Talking to reporters, Congress MLAs Rahul Bondre, Jaykumar Gore, Virendra Jagtap, Abdul Sattar and Amar Kale said they did not heckle the Governor.
“The BJP legislator Girish Mahajan’s account of the alleged incident was taken as an eye-witness account, while we were not given a chance to put forth our side of the story.
Mahajan’s presence at the place of protest itself is suspicious, since he is the Governor’s bodyguard. How was he present there?” they said.
The MLAs appealed to reporters asking them to examine the the facts, since they too were present at the venue.
“We are confident that we will be proved innocent after the probe. If the government keeps us out for two years, we will tour the entire state and go to the people to highlight wrongdoings of the BJP government,” they said.

India my second home  Myanmars Suu Kyi tells PM ModiPrime Minister Narendra Modi shakes hands with Chairperson and General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi during a meeting at Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar on Wednesday. (Source: PTI)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday met Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi who described India as her “second home”, recalling her years spent in the country.
It was Modi’s first interaction with the 69-year-old pro-democracy icon.
The Prime Minister referred to Suu Kyi as a “symbol of democracy”, referring to the enormous efforts made by her for restoration of democracy in Myanmar long ruled by military junta.
After the meeting, spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs, Syed Akbaruddin tweeted that the Myanmarese leader had told Modi that India was her “second home”.
India is my second home – Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to @PMOIndia . pic.twitter.com/K7HFLupha1
— Syed Akbaruddin (@MEAIndia) November 12, 2014
He told reporters that Suu Kyi was effusive in her praise of India.
Suu Kyi told Modi that India was the first country to which she travelled from Burma, which was the old name of Myanmar.
The opposition leader also underscored the importance of stability going hand in hand with democracy.
The Prime Minister also presented Suu Kyi with a special copy of Mahatma Gandhi’s commentary on Bhagwad Gita.
Asked by a journalist whether the prime minister had extended an invitation to the Myanmar leader to visit India, the spokesperson said, “the invitation to Aung San Suu Kyi to visit India is always available as no one invites one to her second home”.
The meeting at the Presidential Suite at Park Royal Hotel here where the prime minister is put up, came on a day when he had a string of bilateral meetings with world leaders and participated in the 12th India-ASEAN summit.
Myanmar is in the midst of a national debate on whether to allow Suu Kyi, Chairperson and General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, to contest the 2015 parliamentary elections, which she is barred from at present due to a provision in the Constitution.
Suu Kyi last visited India in November, 2012. She spent several years in India during her early days when her mother Daw Khin Yi was Ambassador to India. She studied at Lady Shri Ram College in New Delhi and also spent some time as a Fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study in Shimla in 1987.

Orissa journalists lodge FIR against BJD MP and MLA over attempts to bribe themAngry journalists in press meet at Puri waving the envelope at the organisers after they found Rs 200 slipped in their press kits. (Source: IE photo)
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 12:59 am
In a shameful cash-for-coverage episode, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development headed by BJD MP Pinaki Mishra on Wednesday allegedly tried to bribe journalists in temple town of Puri in a press conference causing much outrage among the mediapersons in the town. Soon after the incident came to light more than a dozen journalists in Puri lodged a complaint against Mishra and BJD MLA Maheswar Mohanty accusing them of bribing the members of fourth estate for favourable coverage.
The Committee headed by Puri MP Pinaki Mishra came to Puri on Tuesday to oversee some of the developmental works being undertaken by the union ministry and discuss the progress of some of the projects. Soon after the discussion, a press conference sponsored by Uco Bank was organised at Mayfair Hotel in Puri where the journalists were allegedly given Rs 200 in envelopes.
“When we found the currency notes tucked inside envelopes in the notepad, we started protesting. It was a cheap attempt of the organisers to get a favourable media coverage,” said Jit Patnaik, reporter of a local TV channel. “We all boycotted the press conference.” Some of the reporters later lodged a complaint with the Sea Beach police station against the BJD MP and MLA over the “bribery”
attempt.
However, in a second press conference organised by Uco Bank on behalf of the standing committee at Bhuaneswar, Rs 300 were allegedly given in envelopes to about 40 journalists who attended it. No one is known to have returned the money.
Mishra, who was addressing the press meet, however said there was no attempt to bribe the journalists. “The bank gives conveyance allowance to journalists in such press meets. It was just mere courtesy. There is no quid pro quo arrangement. I find it ridiculous that journalists can be bribed by Rs 200. I don’t care for such FIRs. I know how to deal with such things,” he said.
Mishra said the whole controversy was engineered by his rivals who envied the rise of BJD in Puri.  “Of the 53 journalists who attended the press conference, 15 returned the money while the rest did not complain,” he added.
Puri SP Ashis Singh said the police were still not sure under which section of IPC can a case be lodged against the organisers. “There is
no electoral code of conduct in place now. But we are still closel scrutinising the complaint and would take appropriate steps,” he said.
Opposition Congress and BJP said the ‘bribery incident’ only proved the political culture of the ruling party and was a brazen attempt to
buy the media. “After buying votes through money power, the party now wants to use money power in continued…

Best Boss Ever Richard Branson Gives Unlimited VacationVirgin founder Richard Branson Michael Buckner—Getty Images
Is Virgin's Richard Branson the best boss ever, or an eccentric?
Richard Branson, the chairman and founder of Virgin Group, said on his website Tuesday that he’s giving his whole personal staff unlimited vacation days.
Branson’s staff of almost 200 can “take off whenever they want for as long as they want,” the executive said on his website , adding that employees don’t need to ask for approval, nor are their managers requested to keep track of their days away from work.
Employees can take however much time off from work they choose, “the assumption being that they are only going to do it when they feel a hundred per cent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business,” Branson said.
The flexible hours employees were working both in the office and at home already make it hard to track how many hours they’re working anyway, Branson said.
The Financial Times reported that the new rules apply to around 170 staff at the Virgin head offices in the U.K. and U.S., whereas the 50,000 employees of the larger Virgin Group won’t enjoy the same policy — though Branson said in his note if it’s successful, he’ll encourage Virgin’s subsidiaries to adopt the policy as well.
Branson said he was inspired by Netflix, the video-streaming service, which has a similar policy.

Rupee Ends Higher at 61.49, in Line With Asia Peers After US Jobs Data
Reuters | Updated On: November 10, 2014 18:20 (IST)
Rupee Ends Higher at 61.88 After RBI Policy Review
Mumbai: The rupee strengthened on Monday, tracking emerging market currencies as the dollar weakened following weaker-than-expected US jobs data, although caution ahead of consumer inflation data later this week tempered some of the gains.
The rupee also failed to get much of a lift from shares, which hit their latest record highs earlier in the session but ended flat as investors booked profits.
Traders are looking ahead at the consumer prices data due on Wednesday, amid rising expectation the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could opt for earlier-than-expected cuts in interest rates should inflation continue to ease.
"Markets will watch out for the CPI data for immediate direction. Outlook for rupee broadly remains positive but global dollar strength will have some effects on the rupee," said Hari Chandramgethen, head of foreign exchange trading at South Indian Bank, predicting a range of 61.30 to 62.30 for the week.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.4950/5050 per dollar compared with 61.6425/6525 on Friday. The unit had hit an intra-day low of 61.6750 in the previous session, its lowest level since October 17.
The gains tracked higher emerging market currencies after data on Friday showed US employers added 214,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month, a bit smaller than economists on Wall Street had expected.
Traders will continue to monitor the dollar's moves as well as foreign fund flows.
Foreign investors have bought shares worth a net $1.2 billion in November, taking total inflows so far in 2014 to $14.89 billion. Net inflows into debt in the year stand at $22.85 billion.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.81, while the three-month was at 62.87.

Why the drop in ridership Metro points to transit benefit cutsBy Jonathan O'Connell November 11 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Fewer morning commuters are boarding stations like Greenbelt for long rides.(Evy Mages/For The Washington Post)
Metro ridership has been declining in recent years even as it spikes in other parts of the country, a potential concern to owners of downtown real estate. If employees are working remotely, the value of Washington office space is potentially diminished. And almost all of Metro’s ridership losses in the past year are from weekdays.
Officials and Metro riders have raised a series of possible reasons for the decline, among them federal job cuts, slow economic growth, increased teleworking , more bike commuters, increased fares and disruptions caused by track work.
Recently Metro officials drilled more deeply into the numbers and in a memo  they outlined why they believe a central cause is the cut to federal transit benefits from $245 to $130.
Ridership declines began well before the benefit cut, so benefit levels are unlikely to explain all of the ridership losses. But Metro officials think the cut is behind the most recent drop for two main reasons.
First, some riders with the longest, most expensive commutes are cutting back on Metro the most. Stations at Vienna, Shady Grove, Franconia-Springfield, Huntington, Branch Ave., New Carrollton and Greenbelt — all end-of-the-line stations — have seen some of the steepest decline in morning riders getting aboard.
In total, Metro says that 75 percent of ridership loss has been from trips of seven miles or more, at an average fare of $4.10 per trip.

Second, the number of trips being paid for by the SmartBenefits program has dropped dramatically, by 6,400 on an average weekday.  Meanwhile ridership not relying on the benefits program is up 3,900 trips per weekday.
Take the SmartBenefits losses out of the equation and Metro ridership would have rebounded about 2 percent from Sept., 2013 to Sept., 2014.

Again, these numbers are looking at just the past year, and Metro is under budget pressure, so getting transit benefits restored is part of the strategy  to provide some relief. Agency officials acknowledge that there is likely more causing the drops than just the benefit cut.
“Ridership could be down for a variety of reasons, and we continue to mine the data for other patterns – from the economy to demographics to fares,” its planning staff wrote in a blog post . “We can’t pin all of the ridership loss on the federal transit benefit, but the losses have been concentrated on SmartBenefits users.”

Dr Reddy s  Glenmark See US Sales Hit by Delay in New ApprovalsGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
Mumbai: Indian drugmakers expect a slowdown in new generic drug approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to weigh on sales in their largest market for at least two more quarters, due to an ongoing overhaul of the review process.
India's $15 billion pharmaceutical industry, which has been hit by a spate of regulatory sanctions in the past year due to concerns about production processes, supplies about 40 per cent of generic and over-the-counter drugs to the United States.
The FDA implemented the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) programme in October 2012, giving the agency the right to collect fees from manufacturers to expedite the approval for sale of generic drugs.
But the agency has not made as much progress with clearing the existing backlog of applications for cheap copycat drugs as some Indian manufacturers had hoped, company executives said, which is now beginning to drag on sales in the United States.
A rise in the number of filings for new generic drugs from India and elsewhere, and the need to step up inspections of production facilities before giving final approval, is putting pressure on FDA resources, adding to the backlog, analysts said.
While the FDA is hiring more staff and looking to speed up the process, Indian pharmaceutical industry executives say the pace of approvals is unlikely to pick up until 2016.
Leading Indian generic drugmakers Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd this month posted a drop in their second-quarter US sales, blaming the slowdown in the approval process.
"The US has been challenging in this year because of the significant slowdown in product approvals. The remaining half of this financial year will remain challenging for the industry," Glenmark managing director Glenn Saldanha told Reuters.
Approval lag takes toll
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, India's largest drugmaker by revenue, and Cipla Ltd, both due to report their quarterly results on Thursday, are also expected to be affected by the slowing approvals, analysts said.
While Sun Pharma is expected to report a 17 per cent rise in net profit for the second quarter, helped by a pick-up in sales in its home market, Cipla is expected to report a 7 per cent drop in the net profit.
"The (FDA approval) process will be streamlined with a lag, and that lag is still taking a toll on most companies," said Siddhant Khandekar, vice-president of research at brokerage ICICI Securities. "The implementation has already started, but we will probably see normalisation only by 2016."
FDA spokeswoman Sandy Walsh said the agency was on track with the implementation of the GDUFA and was "maintaining pace with historical performance". The FDA approved 45 new drug applications in August and September 2014 each, which was more than the monthly average for 2012 and 2013, she said.
"We remain committed to utilizing all available resources to ensure expeditious and complete (new application) reviews."
By 2017, the FDA aims to bring down the review time to 10 months from about 30 months now. For applications submitted in the year starting October 2014, the FDA has set a target to complete review of 60 per cent within 15 months.
Some Indian generic drugmakers are, however, uncertain about the pace of approvals in the near future.
"Our inventory is lined up in the United States in anticipation of approvals, and we expect them to come in by January, if not December. But it is not in our control," Dr Reddy's finance chief Saumen Chakraborty said.

The list goes on and on. Granted, Google didn't have the capabilities to do half of these things in 2003. The scary part is that they aspired to one day. That's the smoking gun and that day has arrived. The company didn't stumble into the world of data mining. It invented it and then monopolized it.
Now wait a second. An email service used for data mining to target advertising does not a monopoly make. But what happens when you (Google) buy YouTube and then apply the same principles to streaming content? What happens when you buy companies that data mine your activities inside your home and inside your car? And what happens when you apply your principles to apps you build that let people create documents, map routes, and browse content? Basically, whether you're online, offline, in or out of the house, the moment you awaken you're opening a one-way channel to the Google data-mining monolith.
Do you really think contraptions such as Google Glass, smartwatches, and self-driving cars are truly at their core intended for the betterment of society? What about Project Loon , using hot-air balloons to provide Internet access to the two-thirds of the world living without it? Google would say that's philanthropic, but the truth is it's an opportunity to profit off of the two-thirds of earth's population it has trouble reaching. Simply put, Google wants to find ways to tap into every facet of everyone on the planet to find a monetization opportunity. And that includes children, by the way, which has gotten Google into trouble in the past. They even want to present an augmented reality , a Google reality, as detailed by their investment in the start-up Magic Leap. Why? Because there's more profit in two realities than there is in one I suppose. The thought of living inside of that world makes my skin crawl.
Since 2001, Google has bought upwards of 171 companies , virtually all with data-mining capabilities, yet still faces no regulations for data-mining monopolization. In other words, don't be surprised to see a Google pillow and toilet in your future, because they seem to be the last bastions of privacy and targeted ads that Google hasn't yet penetrated.
At the end of the day, is the convenience that Google offers worth the price of our soul? Do we want to live in a society where everything we do, 24/7, is monitored by corporations like Google? In a creepy twist to this debacle, as Edward Snowden's revelations have shown, governments also have nefarious access to this data about us. As far back as 1949, George Orwell's chilling novel 1984 warned us all of a future infused with the dangers of invasive and dictatorial governments. Now in our 2014 reality, Orwell is no longer here, but fully 65 years later his fictional warning has turned into an odd, frustrating, and horrible reality.  In a bizarre twist to his vision, it turns out to be democracy's private corporations that are the villains, with the government a delighted beneficiary.
Privacy and technology do not have to exist mutually exclusive of one another. The convenience and fun of one can be enjoyed without the sacrificing of the other. If we as a society and as people allow Google to continue down its current path, then we will become our own Walking Dead. Granted, we won't be brain eaters, for that's what Google aspires to be, but we will become a society of the undead wandering aimlessly in a vast dehumanized wasteland of data mining and monetization. The rallying cry for the privacy revolution is urgent and real. The stakes for humanity are significant.  Our great country from its onset was intended to protect our individual and collective rights to privacy.
The United States government is designed to serve and protect its constituents, and is mandated with upholding the Bill of Rights and enforcing the Sherman Antitrust Act.  The time is nigh for our government to take unprecedented legal action to restore our privacy rights and crush this onslaught of invasive and monopolistic data-mining practices.  In this uncharted era where technology companies have paradoxically usurped the role of big brother, our government "by the people, for the people" must stand up.  At the same time, as its citizens, we cannot wait.  Arm yourself by choosing patriotic companies that uphold true privacy, like Apple , and privacy start-ups DuckDuckGo and MeWe. Avoid and deny Google's battalion the data it seeks. What is at stake is democracy itself. In the words of Brazil's newly re-elected president, Dilma Rousseff, "In the absence of the right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore no effective democracy."  Perhaps Mr. Schmidt has been in costume and we've been hoodwinked by the Big Bad Wolf!

A League of His Own: How Lewis Howes Went From Pro Athlete to Thriving Entrepreneurreddit
Lewis Howes is a former professional football player who turned a career-ending injury into a springboard into entrepreneurship. Starting with nothing but an obsession to learn about business and marketing, he has since built a multi-million dollar media empire and become a highly sought-after speaker and consultant.
Lewis is a great connector, so I asked him to share some insights on how he connects with others and stands out from the crowd.
Corcoran: Much of your business growth has been driven by your services and products related to LinkedIn. Why do you think so many people overlook this social media platform? What are some simple steps people can take to maximize their returns with the connections they make on LinkedIn?
Howes: Social media is great if you invest in your audience. People create limited beliefs; they think social media platforms (like LinkedIn) are too complicated to figure out or they're not smart enough to master them.
Another thing I've heard is that they don't think social media platforms (like Twitter) are effective marketing tools.
Every social media platform can add huge value to your business, product, or service if you learn how to do it right.
LinkedIn is different from other platforms because it is centered around professional connections, so it's full of opportunity to stand out. By putting in the effort to leverage its uniqueness, you can easily rise above the crowd.
Simple steps to maximize return:
Know your audience (their struggles, their pain points) -- that will give you clear direction on who to target and what social media platforms you should use to reach them.
Over-deliver good, relevant content.
Grow your email list but don't burn it.
Corcoran: You've grown a large following in part by being honest and candid. Do you see a lot of entrepreneurs missing this seemingly obvious point when it comes to business and relationships?
Howers: Some are. But the great thing about the internet is that if you're inauthentic, or scammy, your audience knows right away. If you're only out there trying to sell, people know the difference.
I think entrepreneurs are learning to be more transparent in sharing who they are and what they believe in.
Corcoran: Growing and leveraging strong relationships is key for anyone looking to increase their net worth or influence. What advice can you offer to anyone looking to create strong relationships, particularly with others who are more successful than they are?
Howes: Mentors are essential to being successful, but you have to think about them in a win-win kind of way. You have to be willing to add a lot of value to their work, even if it's just doing menial stuff or working for free.
I sat in a kitchen closet making phone calls for a mentor of mine when I was starting out just to learn. I never said it was easy ;)
You also have to approach the relationship in a natural way. Never ask a mentor to be your mentor -- that's a sure way to lose the opportunity. Start by asking them to tell you how they achieved success.
Everyone likes telling their own story. Then look for ways you can add value.
Corcoran: Not that long ago, you knew very little about business, entrepreneurship or social media. Yet you've been able to achieve success in these areas in a relatively short amount of time. How can others make the biggest impact when starting a new business venture even with limited experience or skills?
Howes: Know your worth. Don't be scared to share what you know.
I wasn't an authority, but I had the drive and the passion. I wasn't scared to put it out there and create products.
Some people get so caught up in the "it has to be perfect" that they never produce anything, and that's horrible.
You have to focus on your strengths. If you try to do everything well, you'll fail or burn out.
Focus on what you're really good at and either outsource the rest or find shortcuts to help you. Admit your weaknesses and find others to support you in those areas.
Corcoran: You credit "adding value to influential people" as part of your strategy when you first started out. How can you still make this happen when you feel like you have little or no value to give?
Howes: If you're of the belief you have little or no value to give, the first thing you need to do is shift your mindset and get out of that limited belief, because that's probably showing up in a lot more areas of your life than just business (relationships, etc).
Everyone has value to add. Everyone has a skill set or an idea they can share.
What you think is simple and easy other people [may] struggle with, so figure out what comes naturally to you and hone that skill. Then find a way to use that to add value to influential people.
Corcoran: You're a large proponent of being passionate about whatever you take on in business or life. What advice do have for those still struggling to find their passion or who are having trouble trying to parlay it into a successful business?
Howes: You have to start doing something to figure out if you're passionate about it. Most of us aren't going to know our passions ahead of time. We stumble into them because we are taking action and living life.
Try something new, hang out with new people, commit to a challenging project. You'll find what you're passionate about when you break your routine and start investing in yourself.
Also, ask the people closest to you what they think you do great in as this could be a good indicator for which direction to go.
Corcoran: Tell us about a few relationships you credit for your success -- mentors, friends, business associates etc.
Howes: Chris Hawker was the first entrepreneur/inventor who gave me a chance to learn about business and sales and packaging ideas.
He looked past my inexperience and sloppy appearance and let me spend hours of his time talking, in exchange for working for him at his company, Trident Design. He is still a great friend and collaborator.
I heard Stuart Jenkins speak when I was in high school and was so impressed with him. He was the headmaster of the college I ended up at and I started running with him in the mornings just to have a chance to talk to him.
Even though I was always breathless, he gave me time and it meant a lot.
Frank Agin was in the Toastmasters group I joined after my football days. I was terrified of speaking in public and I chased him down after my first meeting to ask if he would coach me.
He helped turn me into the speaker I am today and we ended up launching a product together.
I credit my incredible team for a lot of my success. They support me in every way; everyone I work with is passionate, organized, and they keep me going (literally).
They're the reason I'm able to focus on my mission to serve one hundred million people. I wouldn't be able to do what I do without their support and hard work.

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The 13-day-old BJP Government headed by Devendra Fadnavis today won the confidence motion in Maharashtra Assembly by a voice vote, amid protests by former ally Shiv Sena.
As the motion seeking vote of confidence in the BJP Government moved by MLA Ashish Shelar was passed in the House where the ruling party is in minority, Shiv Sena MLAs stormed the Well seeking division of votes.
“The motion has been passed,” Speaker Haribhau Bagade announced in the din.
Agitated members of Shiv Sena, which had earlier said that it will oppose the trust vote and had demanded that its leader Eknath Shinde be accorded the status of Leader of Opposition, shouted slogans.
The Speaker later also announced the appointment of Shinde as the Leader of Opposition in the House.
Earlier in the day, Bagde was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly after Congress and Shiv Sena withdrew their candidates from the race.
The Speaker had said he would take up the issue of Sena’s demand for LoP’s post after the trust vote as Congress had also staked claim and he would have to study the legal implications. Congress had demanded LoP’s post on the ground that Sena continued to be a constituent of BJP-led NDA.
After Sena members objected to the passing of the trust motion by a voice vote and sought division, Bagde adjourned the House.
When proceedings resumed, the Speaker announced the appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.

$25 fall in crude = $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy: experts; top stock betsAnalyst
(Brent crude has seen a sharp…)
NEW DELHI: India imports around 80 per cent of its crude oil needs, and a fall in the prices of the commodity provides the much needed relief for the country's deficits as the same brings down the import bill.
Analysts say that a $25 fall in crude is like a notional $10 billion stimulus for the Indian economy.
"Falling crude oil prices led to the implementation of the alignment of diesel prices to market rates. This enabled the government to ease subsidy burden. The money saved can now be channeled to some efficient economic projects," says Soumyadip Raha, Research Executive - Oil & Gas at Microsec Capital Ltd.
"The government is now mulling over the idea of bringing some of the benefits of lower oil prices to the government exchequer by way of hiking duties," he adds.
Further, Raha says that falling crude prices result in better realisations for oil & gas firms as it increases the income of the government from taxes.
Brent crude has seen a sharp fall in 2014 so far, down nearly 30 per cent, on the back of strengthening dollar that suppresses demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities.
Brent crude has come down sharply to below $81 a barel in a matter of just five months from around $115 recorded in mid-June. This has already reduced the country's import bill significantly.
India's oil import bill for the last financial year stood at $150 billion.
India's net imports of crude amounts to about a billion barrels a year, and with every dollar decrease in oil prices the bill slips by Rs 4,000 crore, as per media reports.
"The fall in prices (of crude oil) will also lead to lowering of inflation and support higher growth. In turn, lower inflation, improvement in fiscal and current account balances will result in higher GDP growth," says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.
"Yes, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the economy as it creates three-way effect on the economy. A fall in crude oil prices results in a drop in crude oil import bills, and thus the total current account deficit is reduced. This strengthens the currency also," he adds.
Gupta is of the view that a drop in crude prices will reduce government's subsidy burden as well as prices of petroleum products in the country would be lowered leading to ease in inflation.
Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest Investment Advisors, is of the view that we are going to benefit in a big way with the fall in crude. As someone else was suggesting, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the Indian economy, he adds.
Slowing global demand, especially from the European countries and China, is one of the reasons for this massive decline in the prices of crude, say experts.
The slide in oil had a significant impact on inflation as consumer price inflation has cooled off to its lowest level ever, at 6.46 per cent in September. It has even created room for the Reserve Bank to ease interest rates sooner than expected.
 
"The fall in oil prices has also provided a commendable stability to the rupee despite a rally in dollar index, thus attracting more inflows into the economy. Overall, the outlook for economic growth has improved," says Sugandha Sachdeva, AVP & Incharge - Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
As per another estimate, Sachdeva is of the view that a $10 decline in brent implies country's annual import bill falls by around $17 billion.
"Prices are expected to find a strong floor around $80 a barrel and may even retreat towards $88. Having said that, any breach of $80 per barrel would accelerate the fall and lead to a drift towards $75," she adds.
Top bets in the oil & Gas space:
Vivek Gupta,CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited
Investors should go long in OMCs like BPCL, HPCL, IOC we also seen have seen decent long build up (rise in open interest & rise in stock price) in these stocks. Our Top Pick is IOC, which is forming a good consolidation on weekly chart; overall trend of stock is up, investors can further enter long around 380 for the target of 440 & 460 in near term.
Nandan Chakraborty, MD-Institutional Equity Research, Axis Capital
The first thing to do when oil prices dip is to buy interest rate sensitives, and not the ones which depend on oil. It is pretty straightforward because if you look at oil marketing companies, as long as LPG and kerosene remain subsidized, they would not have too much of a slack in terms of increase in their profits.
Krishna Kumar Karwa, MD & CFO, Emkay Global Financial Services
As far as the oil marketing and refining companies are concerned, they are the prime beneficiaries of the diesel deregulation. So, we continue to be bullish on HPCL and BPCL.

A Syrian activist group says U.S.-led coalition airstrikes against the Islamic State group and other extremists have killed more than 860 people, including civilians, since they began in mid-September.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the vast majority those killed — 746 people — have been Islamic State militants. It says another 68 people killed were members of al-Qaida’s Syrian affiliate known as the Nusra Front.
The Observatory also said on Wednesday that at least 50 civilians, including eight children and five women, have been killed in the airstrikes.
The U.S.-led coalition’s aerial campaign in Syria began on Sept. 23. The Islamic State group has been the primary target, although on at least two occasions the United States has carried out strikes targeting the Nusra Front as well.

Sena  Cong cry foul after voice vote goes to Fadnavis govtThe BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra won a crucial confidence motion on Wednesday through a voice vote that the Shiv Sena described as “strangling democracy” and the Congress called “a black day”.
 
The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the 288-member assembly, passed the test to prove its majority through a simple “Aye” from legislators supporting the 13-day-old minority government, though their voice got muffled in the din raised by the Shiv Sena and the Congress.
 
Speaker Haribhau Bagde suspended five Congress legislators for two years after they allegedly heckled governor C Vidyasagar Rao who was injured in the melee as protests inside and outside the assembly turned ugly.
 
The BJP government needed to prove its majority because it was 22 short of the halfway mark in the assembly. Having snapped its 25-year alliance with the Shiv Sena, it didn’t have the 63 MLAs of its former ally to bail it out.
 
Bagde, who was elected unopposed earlier in the day, called the voice vote valid and rejected the opposition’s demand for a poll.
 
“The house should be run as per rules and the Constitution should not be trampled upon. The new government is strangling democracy. We sought division but the trust motion was passed by voice vote,” said opposition leader Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena.
 
The Congress questioned the legitimacy of the trust vote and said it would approach the governor with the request to ask the Fadnavis government to prove its majority by a poll.
 
“This is the darkest day in the history of the Maharashtra assembly. We will not allow the house to function under this minority government,” said former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan.
 
Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam said the BJP government’s act was against the spirit of the Constitution and threatened to take legal recourse. “Vidhan Sabha stands tarnished today. A division would have made it clear whether they have the support of the majority of MLAs. The confidence motion has not been passed.”
 
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Bagde rubbished the opposition’s claims, saying due process was followed.
 
"Congress and Shiv Sena did not ask for a poll (division of votes) at the appropriate time. Since Congress has always been in power it has forgotten the rules about when to ask for division of votes,” Fadnavis told reporters
 
All this while MLAs of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which had committed its support to the Fadnavis government, sat quietly and watched the opposition demand a division. The division of votes, which according to convention is held with legislators voting for or against a motion, was ruled out by the Speaker.
 
The BJP had said it had direct and indirect support of 140 MLAs but needed some legislators to vote for it or abstain in the event of a poll.
 
Since there was no clarity on which way the NCP voted, the speaker’s move was seen as an attempt to save the BJP the embarrassment of publicly going along with Sharad Pawar’s party that has 41 MLAs, sources said.
 
Despite the day’s developments, the BJP indicated in the evening that it was still open to an alliance with the Sena. Fadnavis told HT that he has plans to expand his cabinet before the winter session of the legislature begins in Nagpur on December 8.

Factory output grows 2.5 % in September
National Bureau
economy (general)
Higher output in mining & manufacturing segments
September has brought some cheer on the economic front as industrial production grew at three-month high of 2.5 per cent in September this year, on account of higher output in mining and manufacturing output and larger purchase of capital goods, according to IIP (index of industrial production) estimates released by Central Statistical Office of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Wednesday.
During April-September 2014 period, IIP grew by 2.8 per cent as against 0.5 per cent in the same period previous fiscal.
The mining sector production grew by 0.7 per cent in September as against of 3.6 per cent a year ago. During April-September, the growth was by 2.1 per cent as against a contraction of 2.5 per cent in the same period last fiscal. The production of capital goods grew by 11.6 per cent in September, against 6.6 per cent decline in same month of last year.
During April-September period, the output of capital goods grew by 5.8 per cent as against a dip in production by 0.6 per cent. Overall, 15 of the 22 industry groups in manufacturing showed positive growth in September.
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), in a statement, said that it hoped that the tentative signs of revival would transform into a firm recovery. “A disaggregated analysis shows a robust growth in capital goods sector, indicating some pick up in investment as companies are contemplating expansion as business environment has turned positive. However, consumer durables are still in the red as high interest rates has stymied demand,” the CII said in a statement. It welcomed the drop in inflation based on consumer price index, and hoped that this would propel the RBI to reduce policy rates in its forthcoming monetary policy.

Nifty Hits Record High Above 8,400; Banks, Auto Stocks Lead
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 17:17 (IST)
Nifty Set to Resume Record Rally Next Week, May Scale 8,600
The BSE Sensex and Nifty touched record highs for the second time this week as rate-sensitive stocks such as Axis Bank rose on hopes easing inflation would prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates earlier than expected.
Consumer inflation in October is expected to have eased to a record low of 5.80 per cent, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, according to a Reuters poll.
If the forecast is met, it would also make the RBI's inflation targets - 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent a year later - appear more attainable.
"The market is expecting inflation to come down very fast. So if the rates are not cut then certainly some momentum will be lost," said Vinod Nair, head of fundamental research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd.
The Sensex closed 0.35 per cent up, after earlier rising as much as 0.78 per cent to an all-time high of 28,126.48.
The Nifty rose 0.25 per cent after earlier gaining as much as 0.63 per cent to a record high of 8,415.05.
Rate-sensitive stocks led, with Axis Bank rising 3.1 per cent and ICICI Bank ending 1.3 per cent higher. Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 1.7 per cent and HDFC Bank advanced 0.4 per cent.
Among non-banking lenders, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd surged 7.5 per cent, while LIC Housing Finance ended 4.1 per cent higher.
Some auto stocks also rose. Two-wheeler manufacturers Bajaj Auto gained 2 per cent, Hero MotoCorp ended 1.5 per cent higher, while car maker Maruti Suzuki India gained 0.9 per cent.
Tata Motors also advanced 2 per cent on optimism ahead of its September-quarter earnings on Friday.
Tyre shares rose as investors expect falling crude oil and rubber price to boost companies' margins.
Apollo Tyres gained 3.2 per cent, JK Tyre and Industries rose 3.1 per cent and Ceat Ltd ended 6.6 per cent higher.
Bayer CropScience ended up 10.2 per cent after earlier marking its all-time high of Rs 2,749 after its September-quarter profit growth bucked the trend of weak earnings at rivals.
Among decliners, consumer goods stocks fell on worries that higher-than-expected good and services tax (GST) may restrict profit growth. Media reports on Wednesday said a government panel suggested GST rate of 27 per cent.
Hindustan Unilever fell 0.3 per cent and Marico lost 1.7 per cent.

Centre urges CCI to step up cotton procurementCentre urges CCI to step up cotton procurement 
Tomojit Basu
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov. 12,
With a record harvest but falling global prices, the Government has asked the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) to step up its procurement of raw cotton at the minimum support price (MSP) to prevent distress sales.
At a meeting called by Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh which had the Ministers of Commerce, Textiles and Labour present, the state-run CCI was advised to open more centres to step up the process of buying cotton lest it fall below the MSP. Reports had earlier indicated that cotton prices were ruling below the MSP of Rs. 4,050 in some areas.
“Procurement has already begun in Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana but the number of centres will be increased. Similar operations will begin in Maharashtra and Gujarat as well, it is not too late,” Singh told reporters after the meeting.
About 2.5 lakh bales of 170 kg. each has been procured already from Telangana and AP by the CCI, which operates under the Textiles Ministry.
“We won’t let farmers be affected, their protection is our first priority. The Government will take all measures to buy their cotton,” said Singh, adding that the number of CCI procurement centres in the southern states would increase to more than 130 from 90 at present.
Textiles Minister Santosh Gangwar stated that no procurement cap had been decided. “More centres will be established wherever they are necessary. Whatever quantity is brought, it will be picked up at the MSP,” he said.
India is the world’s second-largest producer and exporter of cotton and is expected to produce a record 40 million bales in the current season that began on October 1. But with global prices and demand waning, domestic prices have slid considerably.
“State Governments must also come forward to extend their cooperation and if they find any nexus between traders and CCI officials then they should definitely take action against them,” urged Labour Minister Bangaru Dattatreya.

Essar Group opens trading office in GenevaEssar Group opens Geneva trading office, expands Europe footprint
Reuters Nov 12, 2014, 07.35PM IST

BNP Paribas
(The entity, PeaKom SA, began…)
LONDON/NEW DELHI: The country's refiner Essar Group has set up an office in Geneva to trade crude oil, refined petroleum products, coal, iron ore and steel, the head of the new company told Reuters on Wednesday.
The entity, PeaKom SA , began operations in September and will be a global trading platform for Essar, according to Chief Executive Gilles Sayer .
The opening cements the company's involvement in Europe, bolstering a presence that already includes London-based traders and the 245,000 barrel per day (bpd) Stanlow refinery in the UK.
"At this stage, the company in Geneva will straddle all the commodity flows of Essar," Sayer said, adding it could grow beyond that. In an emailed statement, PeaKom said it will use its banking relationships and deal origination as a "one-stop-shop" for Essar commodities.
Raman Jaggi, group treasurer of Essar, will serve as PeaKom's chief financial officer, and Guillaume de la Ville , formerly of BNP Paribas and Gunvor, has started as head of trade finance. Tarun Naruka, Essar's former corporate finance lead and Thibaut Barthelme, formerly of Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank , are also working with PeaKom.
Sources said the office includes up to ten people, but Sayer declined to comment on the number of staff.
The expansion of Essar's European operations indicate that it is looking to maintain a long-term presence in the region, which could be of comfort to staff at the Stanlow refinery in Britain who watched as the Milford Haven plant in Wales was shuttered last week.
Jobs at European refiners are at risk as analysts say more than 1 million barrels per day of refining capacity in Europe will close due to fierce competition from state-of-the-art refineries opening in the Middle East and Asia.
The Stanlow refinery mothballed a crude distillation unit that accounted for one third of its production capacity in September in an effort to save the plant. Its capacity dropped to around 195,000 bpd from 296,000 as a result.

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) today reported a 50 per cent drop in its September quarter net profit as refining margin dipped on slumping international oil prices.
Net profit in July-September at Rs 464.20 crore, or Rs 6.42 per share, was 50 per cent lower than Rs 931.13 crore, or Rs 12.88 a share, in the same period a year ago, the company said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
The company earned $ 2.36 on turning every barrel of crude oil into product as opposed to a gross refining margin of $ 4.38 per barrel last year.
Turnover was marginally higher at Rs 62,025.16 crore in the second quarter as compared to Rs 61,784.51 crore in the same period a year ago.
BPCL said almost all its losses incurred on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at rates below cost were made up by cash subsidy from government (Rs 1,505.80 crore) and support from upstream firms like ONGC (Rs 3530.79 crore).
However, because of unmet losses of first quarter, the company had to in first half of current fiscal absorb Rs 503.42 crore.
Sales rose to 17.13 million tonnes when compared to 16.38 million tons, it said adding the increase was mainly in petrol (10.34 per cent), LPG (12.03 per cent) and diesel (Rs 1.92 per cent).

Suspended Congress MLAs deny injuring MaharashtraGovernorThe suspended Congress MLAs alleged that the entire episode was a "conspiracy" by the BJP government.
Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 8:20 pm
All five suspended Congress members of Maharashtra Assembly denied causing injury to Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao on Wednesday and alleged that the entire episode was a “conspiracy” by the BJP government.
Talking to reporters, Congress MLAs Rahul Bondre, Jaykumar Gore, Virendra Jagtap, Abdul Sattar and Amar Kale said they did not heckle the Governor.
“The BJP legislator Girish Mahajan’s account of the alleged incident was taken as an eye-witness account, while we were not given a chance to put forth our side of the story.
Mahajan’s presence at the place of protest itself is suspicious, since he is the Governor’s bodyguard. How was he present there?” they said.
The MLAs appealed to reporters asking them to examine the the facts, since they too were present at the venue.
“We are confident that we will be proved innocent after the probe. If the government keeps us out for two years, we will tour the entire state and go to the people to highlight wrongdoings of the BJP government,” they said.

Death by sterilisation in India: Chhattisgarh is just one horrorThe death of 13 women at a state-run sterilisation camp in Chhattisgarh underlines flagrant violation of rules on implementing population stabilising campaigns as well as inadequate monitoring of such projects by health authorities across the country.
 
Although the coercive campaign spearheaded by Sanjay Gandhi in the 1970s has been replaced with a voluntary policy that promotes education of women and healthcare rather than demographic control, the Indian sterilisation programme remains deeply flawed, experts say.
 
For instance, the surgeries in Chhattisgarh were conducted in violation of a 2005 Supreme Court ruling that said a medical team could conduct only up to 30 surgeries a day with two separate laparoscopes. And, a doctor could do no more than 10 sterilisations a day.
 
But in Chhattisgarh, a lone surgeon performed 83 operations in less than 5 hours, showing that these operations were not done under standard protocols.
 
Official guidelines also say that all sterilisation camps must be organised in government facilities. The Chhattisgarh camp was organised in a private charitable hospital which had been closed for a year now. Media reports said rusty scalpels and tools were used and some of the medicines administered could have been spurious.
 
“The systemic failures which led to this incident need to be addressed,” said a joint statement of health workers and women’s groups said on Wednesday.
 
“The ‘camp method’ of sterilisation needs to be stopped with immediate effect as quality of care is seriously compromised in mass sterilisation programmes that are meeting earmarked targets.”
 
Sterilisation is the most popular form of birth control in India. Encouraged by cash incentives, about 4 million people a year undergo surgery. Almost all are women.
 
Experts say last week’s deadly incident is also a result of the pressure to meet the government’s sterilisation targets. In 2012, India committed to providing 48 million additional women and girls with access to contraceptives by 2020. However, in India about one in 5 women of reproductive age do not have access to modern method of contraception such as condoms and pills.
 
Chances are that India’s promises at the 2012 Family Planning Global Summit in London will reinforce the pressures of meeting ‘targets’, which has dangerous and long-term implications for the health of the people.
 
Many states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan are accused of setting unofficial sterilisation targets, violating the target-free population policy of 2000.
 
The overt emphasis placed on sterilising women is also out of step with best practices because male sterilisation such as vasectomy involves comparatively lesser health risks.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."

Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.

US-China climate deal: CSE seeks to blame Ra...Barrack Obama
(Lambasting the US-China…)
NEW DELHI: Lambasting the US-China climate deal , an advocacy group today said the two biggest polluters signing such a pact was the result of a "disastrous formula" agreed by India in two key UN climate conferences when Jairam Ramesh was the Environment Minister.
Eminent environmentalist and Director General of Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE ) Sunita Narain also termed as "self-serving" the deal in which both the US and China have agreed to converge their per capita emissions at 12 tonne in 2030.
Though there was not an immediate reaction from Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on the China-US deal, Ministry sources indicated that it would not going to affect India's relations with China on cooperating in global climate platforms.
Both India and China are key members of BASIC group of nations on climate issues.
Narain's remarks did not evoke immediate response from Ramesh when contacted.
Environment Ministry officials feel that the US-China deal was reached on the concept of cutting down carbon emission through Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and they are not internationally determined.
However, Narain hit out at the deal, saying it was not in line with meeting the 2 degree centigrade temperature target mandated by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change.
"China-US deal on climate change is not ambitious enough, it in fact will take the world towards a 4-degree Centigrade rise," she told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.
The deal was announced jointly by US President Barrack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping today in Beijing.
Blaming the policy adopted by the then Environment Minister Ramesh at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen and Cancun, Narain said, India under the Congress leader "had agreed to a disastrous formula called pledge and review".
"Instead of a target being set for the whole world, individual country targets were set. What we are seeing now is the culmination of that... where China and the US put their number on the table and said this is how much we can do," she said.

Low oil prices to bite into 2015 US shale gr...Brazil
(Benchmark oil prices have…)
LONDON: Falling oil prices may cut investment in US shale oil by 10 percent next year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said, slowing growth in a sector that has turned the United States into a major global producer.
The recent drop in oil prices "should not blind us to the problems that may be around the corner," Fatih Birol, the IEA's chief economist, told Reuters ahead of the launch of the agency's 2014 World Energy Outlook.
Benchmark oil prices have dropped by about 30 percent over the past four months to around $82 a barrel due mostly to increased supplies from the Middle East and North America , squeezing budgets of oil-producing nations and oil companies.
"If prices remain at these lows, this may result in a decline in US upstream capital expenditures by 10 percent in 2015, which will have (an) implication for future production growth," Birol said.
The lower oil prices are also increasing debt levels for Brazil's state-owned Petrobras , which could lead to delays in projects there, too, Birol said at the launch of the report.
US shale oil output rose by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) per year over the past four years as strong oil prices led to a boom in fracking, a technique that uses materials under high pressure to release gas and oil trapped in deep rock.
US shale production is set to peak at around 4.5 million bpd in the 2020s before gradually declining, according to the IEA.
Oil prices could, however, rise as weak prices perk demand.
The IEA forecast global oil demand to rise from 90 million bpd in 2013 to 104 million bpd in 2040, when the energy supply mix divides into four almost-equal parts between oil, gas, coal and low-carbon sources.
On the demand side, while China has supported most of the global demand growth over the past decade, India and east Asian countries are set to become the main drivers, Birol said in a news conference.
"China energy demand growth is slowing down and in the 2020s it (the slowdown) will be much more pronounced," he said, as the world's top energy consumer becomes more energy efficient and its economic and population growth ease.
Strife in the Middle East, mostly in Iraq , poses a threat to future supplies - hampering investments necessary to sustain production growth there, Birol said.
Demand for gas is set to grow by more than half by 2040, the fastest rate among the fossil fuels, and increasingly flexible global trade in liquefied natural gas (LNG) will decrease risks of supply disruptions, the IEA said.

Wait 1 second to continue.
After 10 years of hard work and one nerve-wracking night, the Rosetta mission has made history by landing on the surface of a comet.
The lander Philae was confirmed to touch down on the surface of the comet more than 300 million miles away at 11:03 a.m. Eastern. Now, scientists expect it to send a panoramic image home and begin analyzing the comet for scientists back on Earth.
Philae is already transmitting scientific data back home, but we're still waiting to see whether the probe is in a stable position. Until we know it's anchored tight, it could roll onto its back and never get back up.
Tensions were high in the European Space Agency's German mission control center, especially as the landing window approached. Because the comet that Philae landed on is so far from Earth, there's a communications delay of 28 minutes. So as the minutes ticked by, the Rosetta team knew that Philae had already either landed or failed — and there was nothing they could do but wait for the data to reach them. Those following the video online were nearly as desperate for news, and Twitter became a sounding chamber of anticipation and excitement.
But a few minutes after 11 a.m., the stern, cautious expressions of the mission control team melted into smiles. And just like that, the world swiveled from anxiety to elation: Philae was on the surface of the comet and ready to do some science.

The comet contains the materials that originally formed our solar system, frozen in time. By digging them out, we can learn more about the origins of our planet. The Rosetta spacecraft has made invaluable observations about the comet's attributes, and it will continue to do so as it follows it around the sun for the next year. But Philae will be able to look more closely at the comet's physical and molecular composition.
"It's a look at the basic building blocks of our solar system, the ancient materials from which life emerged," said Kathrin Altwegg of the University of Bern in Switzerland, one of the Rosetta project's lead researchers. "It's like doing archaeology, but instead of going back 1,000 years, we can go back 4.6 billion."
It's no easy thing to land on a comet's surface: These chunks of rock and ice are constantly spinning, and Comet  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which was discovered in 1969, orbits the sun at a speed of about 85,000 mph. It's irregularly shaped — like a toddler's play-dough impression of a duck, or something — and its surface is uneven and pitted. And in a universe of unimaginable proportion, Rosetta's target is just 2.5 miles in diameter — smaller than Northwest Washington's Columbia Heights neighborhood.
So Rosetta has taken an onerous journey to get in sync with the comet's orbit, which would allow it to drop down a lander. In 2004, the spacecraft began what would be three looping orbits around the sun, altering its trajectory as it skimmed Mars, just 150 miles from the surface, and enduring 24 minutes in the planet’s shadow to align with Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The cumulative distance traveled by the craft – with all its looping and gravity assists – is a stunning 4 billion miles . “When the Rosetta signal reappeared after the passage behind Mars, shortly after the end of the ‘shadow’ period, there was a collective sigh of relief,” ESA said .
At one point in 2011, the spacecraft even had to hibernate for nearly three years. It flew so far from the sun — nearly 500 million miles — that its solar panels couldn't leech enough energy to keep the spacecraft operational. But in January of this year, Rosetta woke up, and quickly approached its target.
The last leg of this landing has not been without its bumps. Even as the mission approached its most critical moment, controllers at the European Space Agency on Tuesday night reported a problem with the thruster on the lander that could make for a rough landing. The gravity of the problem — and the extent to which it threatened the mission — remained unknown. “We’ll need some luck not to land on a boulder or a steep slope,” blogged Stephan Ulamec, lander manager for the project.
Following its separation early Wednesday morning, Philae made a seven-hour-long drop to the surface. After successfully making a satellite connection with Rosetta (without which the probe would have been functionally lost), Philae sent home a goodbye picture of its mother-ship.

Then, we watched and waited. We worried we'd have to watch mission control experience the agony of an upside-down rover, lost forever. If the surface of the comet was too hard, the probe might have bounced on impact and landed badly.
"We're looking at the pictures of this comet and interpreting them the way we would somewhere on Earth, because we're just not tuned to understand what they mean for comet geology yet," said Claudia Alexander, the project scientist who's overseeing NASA's many contributions to the effort.
Luckily, the probe's sensors detected a soft landing. But mission control hasn't gotten confirmation that the probe's harpoons deployed — let alone that they stuck. The Rosetta team is concerned that the probe might roll out of place, but they're considering re-firing the harpoons to try again.  If the surface is too soft, it's possible that the probe won't be able to anchor itself at all — which would make it hard to stay upright. And if the team refires the harpoons, it's possible that the probe will actually just get knocked into a bad position.
If Philae flips over, it has no way to right itself.
But even if the morning ends with disappointment, Rosetta has been — and will continue to be — a resounding success, researchers say.
Open University space scientists, who have spent 20 years researching and developing tools for the Rosetta mission, await its landing on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko on Nov. 12, 2014. In this video, the team describes how Rosetta came together, how it will land and what it has learned. (The Open University)
"The lander would be the icing on the cake," Altwegg said. "But we've been receiving data on the atmosphere of the comet since August."
Alexander agreed. "Even during the descent itself, we'll be taking readings that will move our understanding of the comet forward leaps and bounds," she said.
And no matter what, Rosetta will continue to trail the targeted comet as it orbits the sun this year, no doubt giving scientists unprecedented insight into its composition.
But whether or not Philae lives up to its full potential as a scientific instrument, it has landed on a moving comet and shown us that humanity is capable of incredible things.

Maharashtra: Speaker suspends five Congress MLAs for two years for mishandlingGovernorMaharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao addresses the joint session of State Assembly in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Source: PTI Photo)
Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:18 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 8:28 am
Five Congress legislators were on Wednesday suspended by Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagde for two years for allegedly heckling and physically stopping Governor C Vidyasagar Rao as he entered the Vidhan Bhawan today.
Revenue minister Eknath Khadse proposed their suspension saying that the Governor had received “injuries” on his left hand during the incident.
Congress MLAs who have been suspended are Jaykumar Gore, Rahul Bondre, Abdul Sattar, Amar Kale and Virendra Jagtap.
A House panel is set to probe the incident and submit its report during the winter session of the legislature.

Netherlands unveils solar-powered bicycle pathThe Netherlands unveiled the world's first solar bike path, a revolutionary project to harvest the sun's energy that could eventually also be used on roads.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
KROMMENIE(NETHERLANDS): The Netherlands on Wednesday unveiled the world's first solar bike path, a revolutionary project to harvest the sun's energy that could eventually also be used on roads.
The so-called "SolaRoad" bike path is made of concrete modules each measuring 2.5 by 3.5 metres (eight by 11 feet), embedded with solar panels covered in tempered glass.
To help prevent accidents, the glass has been given a special non-slip surface.
The solar cells currently put the electricity they generate onto the national grid, but future plans include using the energy to power street lights.
Electric bikes and cars will one day be able to refuel using contactless charging directly from the road or bike path, said Sten de Wit, a physicist who helped develop the project.
"The idea is that in the Netherlands we have approximately 140,000 kilometres (87,000 miles) of road which is much bigger than all the rooftops put together," De Wit told AFP.
"We have 25,000 kilometres of bike paths in the Netherlands." "If we can integrate it in our roads then we'll have huge extra potential for generating solar electricity," he said.
The path has been working for 16 days, during which it generated 140 kilowatt hours of electricity, equivalent to around 140 washing machine cycles, said SolaRoad spokeswoman Jannemieke van Dieren.
The project has so far cost three million euros ($3.7 million), mainly for research, but SolaRoad declined to say what the cost per kilometre might be.
Dutch Economics Minister Henk Kamp cycled the first 70-metre (230-feet) pilot stretch of bike path on a busy provincial bicycle route north of Amsterdam on Wednesday.
"The Netherlands is quite ambitious when it comes to sustainable energy. This innovation is an important part of it," Kamp told AFP afterwards.
The small country of 18 million -- most of them cyclists -- hopes to triple sustainable energy usage by 2020 and be "energy neutral" by 2050, Kamp said.
The SolaRoad will be tested over the next two years on a path that carries around 2,000 cyclists a day, De Wit said.
The aim is to have the solar road commercially available on Dutch roads within the next five years as the number of electrically-powered cars and bicycles grows.
"We are very confident that in five years we will have a product we can apply on a large scale," De Wit said.

How to make free money by team whacking the fix

Britain's Financial Conduct Authority
(Regulators said traders…)
LONDON: Chat room records published by regulators who imposed massive fines on banks for trying to rig foreign exchange rates reveal a macho culture among traders who used banter laced with obscenities in a ruthless pursuit of "free money".
Foreign exchange traders at some of the world's biggest banks encouraged each other to join together in order to " team whack " currency rates in a joint effort to manipulate the vast foreign exchange market for profit.
"Don't want other numpty's in mkt to know (about information exchanged with the group), but not only that is he gonna protect us like we protect each other," one foreign exchange trader commented to fellow dealers at other banks.
In anonymised transcripts published alongside record $3.4 billion regulatory fines on five banks on Wednesday, traders showed a brazen disregard for integrity that has destroyed trust in financial markets, regulators said.
Trading around the daily currency benchmarks known as "fixes", can be highly profitable for banks. They can take advantage of differences between rates leading up to the fix and the fix rate itself, which is the rate their clients get for orders thay have placed to buy or sell currencies.
In message groups with names such as "The Players" and "The three musketeers", traders teamed up to buy or sell currencies, often sharing confidential information about their orders.
One successful trade allowed traders at HSBC to make a quick profit of $162,000 selling sterling for dollars, while traders at UBS collected $513,000 after selling euros for dollars.
Congratulations flowed fast and furious, according to the documents released by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority , the main financial markets regulator.
"there you go ... go early, move it, hold it, push it," said one trader. "nice work gents ... I don my hat" and "don't mess with our ccy (currency)," said others. "we fooking killed it right" and "hes sat back in his chaoir (sic) ... feet on desk ... announcing to desk ... that's why I got the bonus pool".
Regulators said traders were putting their own interests ahead of their customers while abusing the trust of the public in a largely unregulated market in which more than $5 trillion changes hands each day.
Or, as one trader put it: "How can I make free money with no fcking heads up?"

Bharat Petroleum Posts 50 Per Cent Fall in Q2 Profit

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) on Wednesday reported a 50 per cent drop in net profit for the quarter ended September 2014 as refining margin dipped on slumping international oil prices.
Net profit in July-September at Rs 464.20 crore, or Rs 6.42 per share, was 50 per cent lower than Rs 931.13 crore, or Rs 12.88 a share, in the same period a year ago, the company said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
The company earned $2.36 on turning every barrel of crude oil into product as opposed to a gross refining margin of $4.38 per barrel last year.
Turnover was marginally higher at Rs 62,025.16 crore in the second quarter as compared to Rs 61,784.51 crore in the same period a year ago.
BPCL said almost all its losses incurred on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at rates below cost were made up by cash subsidy from government (Rs 1,505.80 crore) and support from upstream firms like ONGC (Rs 3530.79 crore).
However, because of unmet losses of first quarter, the company had to in first half of current fiscal absorb Rs 503.42 crore.
Sales rose to 17.13 million tonnes when compared to 16.38 million tonnes, it said adding that the increase was mainly in petrol (10.34 per cent), LPG (12.03 per cent) and diesel (Rs 1.92 per cent).

Dwindling share of first-time buyers slowing housing recovery1
Rider is heartened, however, by the finding that 79 percent of recent borrowers said their home was a good investment.
Among those people who did buy their first home during the past year, the median age was 31 years old and the median income was $68,300, and they bought a 1,570-square-foot home that cost $169,000, according to the survey.
One other telling finding among first-time buyers: Thirty-five percent of them received a Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgage, down from 39 percent last year. FHA-backed loans had been a popular choice because of their low, 3.5 percent down-payment requirement, but the now-higher fees and insurance premiums on those loans have reduced their appeal. In 2010, 56 percent of first-time buyers received an FHA mortgage in 2010.
This year's typical repeat buyer, 53 years old and with annual earnings of $95,000, bought a 2,030-square-foot home and paid $240,000.
To perform the research, the association randomly mails a 127-question survey to homebuyers who bought a home between July 2013 and June 2014.
Time to refinance, again? Mortgage interest rates are near lows not seen in more than a year, and the most recent decline in rates has boosted the number of homeowners who may be eligible to refinance their mortgages and lock in a lower rate. Most economists expect rates to start inching back up to the 5 percent mark in the second half of 2015.
According to an analysis by Black Knight Financial Services, before the most recent declines in the interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, about 6 million borrowers met the general criteria needed to refinance a mortgage. That meant they had at least 20 percent equity in the home, good credit and were up to date on their mortgage payments. They also had an interest rate that was high enough that the savings they would see were worth going through the process and costs involved in refinancing.
After touching 4.23 percent in mid-September, the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has trended downward, according to Freddie Mac's weekly survey.
Black Knight looked at the population of borrowers with loans that carry interest rates of at least 4.5 percent and found that figure of 6 million potential refinancers has now swelled almost 25 percent to 7.4 million borrowers. "This is a relatively conservative assessment though, as those with current rates of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent could arguably benefit from refinancing as well," said Trey Barnes, a senior vice president at the company. "That group adds another 1.7 million borrowers to the equation."
According to Freddie Mac, almost three-quarters of borrowers who refinanced their primary mortgages during the quarter kept their same loan amount or lowered it by bringing additional money to the table at closing. Also, 28 percent did a cash-out refinancing, the highest share in five years and an indication of how a solid run of home appreciation is giving homeowners more financial flexibility.

Cabinet reshuffle: Technocrats in PM Modi s team for reforms pushComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi inducted Sunday three technocrats -- a CA, a Harvard MBA and an IIT graduate -- in his ministry with the government preparing to fast-track reforms to help the economy claw out of its worst slump in 25 years.

In the coming months, the government has promised to move on big-ticket issues such as land acquisition, infrastructure, skill development and also to step up growth in industry and agriculture.
Suresh Prabhu, 61, the new railway minister, is also the PM’s sherpa for the G-20 summit later this month.
A former chartered accountant, Prabhu is seen as a reformist, credited with laying the foundation for restructuring of the country’s complex electricity sector when he was the power minister in the Vajpayee government.
Among other things, the government will have to quickly set out a medium to long-term vision for the Indian Railways network. For long, the railways has suffered from low investment and populist policies to subsidise fares turning the once-mighty system into a slow and congested network that crimps growth.
 
While the economy is in a much better shape than it was five months ago, experts reckon sustained revival in investment is yet to start. Pressure is building for greater restructuring to remove possible constraints to growth.
With low-energy prices, the currency stable and inflation falling, interest rates are likely to come down. This favourable climate will allow more room for “big-bang reforms”. “It may just be the time to be a little more courageous,” a leading industrialist said.
Former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who is the new defence minister, is a metallurgical engineering graduate from IIT-Bombay. The 58-year-old takes over at a time when the government has opened up India’s lucrative defence sector, which is central to Modi’s Make in India campaign, to private industry.
Harvard University and IIT-educated Jayant Sinha, 51, a former top executive with wide experience in corporate governance and strategy consulting, could play perfect support role for finance minister Arun Jaitley as his junior minister ahead of the budget.
 
“At a time when the economy is undergoing a recovery process, it is important to fast-track facilitative and promotional policies to strengthen this. The cabinet expansion sends out a strong signal that the government is serious about accelerating the reforms process,” CII president Ajay Shriram said.

The Biggest Lie About LotteriesAnyone who's ever bought a lottery ticket needs to see John Oliver's explanation of how it all works .
First, there are the remote odds of winning, described on "Last Week Tonight" as akin to being struck by lightning while being eaten by a shark.
Secondly, there's the notion that playing the lottery can help fund education, which is supposed to make lottery players feel good about spending money on the games even when they lose. But as Oliver revealed on Sunday night, the truth about where that money goes might not leave you feeling very good at all:

In North Carolina, for example, the lottery promised to add an extra $500 million to education every year when it was launched a decade ago. Today, the state spends less per student on education than it did when the lottery began, Oliver said.

The Internets perfect deathBy Caitlin Dewey November 11 Follow @caitlindewey
As a 46-year-old male actor, Will Smith is, demographically, the perfect Internet death hoax victim. (Reuters/Andrew Kelly)
The actor Will Smith died today in Los Angeles after suffering a fatal car accident, Smith’s family said in a statement released this afternoon. The “Men in Black” star was 46.
JUST KIDDING, that’s a lie. Not a single word of it is true. But according to analyses by Dadaviz  and the Washington Post, you’d probably believe it if you saw it in your Facebook feed. It is, in a word, the Internet’s perfect celebrity death hoax.
Death hoaxes are a given on the web these days, of course. They’re so widespread and so predictable , in fact, that even the juiciest ones typically fail to register on anything like a mass scale. Of the untold dozens of death hoaxes sites like Huzlers and Empire News have pumped out in the past six months, only a handful have really stuck: Betty White’s reported passing in September ; Tracy Morgan’s rumored death and/or amputation after his early June car accident; the untimely demise of American child star-turned-pizza-band-frontman Macaulay Culkin, just this past weekend . (These hoaxes are rarely done just for laughs; sites make money off ads and can improve their search-engine results with well-placed “stories.”)
[Related: How and why these hoaxes happen -- and how to stop them]
When they’re flying by you on the daily, each hoax seems like a one-off, an aggravating gotcha that boomerangs back into the Internet void before you have the chance to scrutinize it closely. But when you actually zoom out a bit, enough to fit all the biggest hoaxes in one frame, some pretty clear patterns emerge. Like, the Internet prefers to fake-kill men over women. And the favored cause of death is car accidents, versus overdoses, murders, suicides or the unlikely runner-up: falls from cliffs.
That last factoid comes courtesy Jody Sieradzki at Dadaviz, who on Monday compiled news reports on celebrity death hoaxes into a fascinating chart on alleged COD . Intrigued, we returned to her sources — three lists of prominent celebrity death hoaxes — and compiled some more details about 60 celebrities who Internet-died between 2010 and 2014.
The lists aren’t scientific or conclusive, of course. (This is the Internet, after all — conclusiveness isn’t exactly its thing .) But they do capture the most high-profile, viral hoaxes of the last four years, which means they essentially tell us which hoaxes the Internet fell for hardest. Demographically speaking, the average victim is — like Will Smith! — a 46-year-old man. And actors, even washed-up ones, far outnumber any other type of celebrity victim.
What are we supposed to make of this? Nothing, really. Internet hoaxes are a bottomless pit of exploitation that defy reason, scrutiny or anything approaching shame . But next time you read that a middle-aged actor was in a serious car accident, or that he suffered a fatal fall snowboarding (why is it always snowboarding?), perhaps take it with a grain of salt. Actually, do that either way.

McCain: Obama Is Not Taking the Advice of His Military Commanders on ISISreddit
NEW YORK -- Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) -- the powerful incoming chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee -- had harsh words for the Obama Administration on Monday over the president's strategy to fight ISIS and conclude a deal with Iran on its nuclear program.
Speaking at the 92 St. Y in New York, McCain told his host, Bob Schieffer, that the president wasn't taking the advice of his military commanders in the fight against ISIS and was doing a poor job -- both strategically and in communicating his goals to the American people.
The former Republican presidential candidate blamed the current situation on the hasty withdrawal of American forces from Iraq. If the Obama Administration had left soldiers behind, he said, "then Maliki would not have done what he did. It gave rise to ISIS. And now we are facing, I believe, a direct threat to the United States of America."
Late last week President Obama authorized sending another 1,500 American soldiers to Iraq . He also urged Congress to release $5.6 billion to help fund the fight against ISIS. The soldiers, the president announced, would train Iraqi and Kurdish forces in their effort to push back against ISIS. The $5.6 billion includes $1.6 billion to establish a fund that would support Iraqi and Kurdish security forces, and a Pentagon spokesman said CENTCOM will establish training centers for a dozen brigades.
McCain made clear that he thought President Obama's strategy of targeted air strikes, training friendly forces and gradual escalation would not be able to eradicate ISIS. The solution, McCain said, is not "four or five airstrikes a day, my friend. It's not putting 1,500 [troops on the ground] and then another 1,500."
"These people are dedicated to our destruction and we're going to have to destroy them," McCain declared. On Sunday, the senator told Fox News , "we are going to have to have more boots on the ground because the only way you can really identify targets is to have boots on the ground."
When asked what he would do, McCain said, "I would sit down with my military leaders and I would say, 'What do we need to do to destroy ISIS?'.... I know for a fact that the president is not taking the military advice that he is getting. He is not exercising the military recommendations that he is getting from our military leadership."
A WEAK DEAL WITH IRAN
Senator McCain was also deeply pessimistic about America's negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. The potential agreement currently being discussed, he said, "will only delay the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran, some say six months, some say a year. That's not acceptable." To this remark, applause rang out around the auditorium.
Referring to recent tensions between the White House and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over a deal with Iran, McCain worried that if there is a breakdown in trust between Washington and Jerusalem, "it would motivate the Israelis to take action on their own."
Further, he said, "I worry that if this agreement is believed -- in the region, not just Israel, but throughout the region -- that it does not prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons capability, the Saudis will buy nuclear weapons from Pakistan," -- he snapped his fingers - "like that. Then, all the other countries [in the region] would become nuclearized. I'm very worried about it."
A bill co-authored by McCain and being pushed urgently forward by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) would seek to prevent the Obama Administration from going it alone on the negotiations without Congress, as he has hinted he might. Senator Graham told the Washington Post on Monday that he plans to get debate on the bill, which would require the Senate to approve an eventual agreement, started this week -- even before Republican reinforcements arrive in Congress in January.

How Do You Handle a Boss Who Treats You Like an Adminreddit
When I finally got my first female boss after many years of working for men and fighting hard for every promotion, I was shocked when she started treating me like an administrative assistant instead of a senior manager.
It started the first week Ms. Tech-Challenged joined the company.  I managed fifteen people, while she supervised me and three other department heads.  My boss wasn't familiar with basic programs like Microsoft Outlook, and whenever she got stuck, she would instant message me.  I would rush over, show her how to solve her problem, and hightail it out of her office--highly annoyed at the time I was wasting. I did bring up our IT Help Desk, but someone the phone just wasn't going to cut it for her.
Ms. Tech-Challenged also had an administrative assistant. But he was shared by all the department heads, which meant that he never seemed to have time for any of us. So my boss's requests kept flying in and I kept cheerfully complying. But my hidden resentment soured our whole relationship.
Since then, colleagues have asked me about similar problems with their bosses.  Here's the advice I wish I had followed back then.
Option 1:  Be a little harder to find.
I used to pride myself on never using "Do Not Disturb" on my instant message status unless I was in a meeting.  But if my boss had found me unavailable once or twice, surely she would found another option.
Option 2:  Don't be afraid to say no.
If my "Do Not Disturb" status failed to deter a desperate ping from Ms. Tech-Challenged, I could have just answered back with a cheery "Sorry, tied up -- can't help out right now."  By always rushing over, I probably gave her the impression I didn't have that much work to do.
Option 3:  Supply the information in a different way.
We had created on-boarding guides for new hires, but they didn't have all the information my boss was looking for.  I could have asked a member of my team to expand our cheat sheets and helped other new hires with similar questions.
Option 4:  Use my boss' requests to build a stronger relationship.
While this option would have been the hardest for me at the time, I'm sure it would have been the most successful. I now think my boss wasn't actually looking for an administrative assistant, but a work buddy. She was overwhelmed with a big new job and I was the person she felt most comfortable coming to for help.  Why was I unable to see that as an opportunity instead of a burden?
Instead of rushing out of her office after I answered her trivial questions, I could have sat myself down and started a conversation. So, how are things going? I know how complicated this place was for me when I started.  Do you have any questions about our strategy?
Perhaps we could have built a relationship in which she would have relied on me for more significant advice than how to book a conference room.  Worst case scenario, she would have realized that pinging me would turn into a time suck and would have thought twice about bothering me in the future.  Either way, my feelings of resentment would have lessened and I might have been able to build a healthier, more equitable relationship with a boss who just needed a little bit of help.

When a Tie is Not Just a Tiereddit
My husband has a beef about ties. Or, more precisely, about the lack thereof.
A future sociologist exploring the culture of work at the setting of the 20th century and dawn of the 21st would undoubtedly take note of the changing mores of appropriate office wear. The era of casual dress crept up on us slowly, but now every organization this side of Wall Street seems to have taken up the khaki banner. (And even Wall Street is apparently not immune to the trend.)
The hippest companies sport a tieless C-suite. Try googling images of "CEO" and you'll find that while many of the male prototypes do wear ties (in the spirit of pop culture fantasy, there are a handful of women on the page, as well), a startling number gaze confidently out from above tie-less, casually unbuttoned collars. (Of course, you'll also find the ubiquitous shots of Mark Zuckerberg and his ilk, sporting the best of couture Old Navy.)
As someone who is self-employed, working in my home office, I have my own appreciation of casual dress. Truth be told, the ability to dictate my own wardrobe -- specifically, to wear sneakers as much, and heels as little, as possible -- was one of the deciding factors in going into business for myself. While I'm a firm believer that pajamas do not make for a productive, workwoman-like atmosphere, I also don't believe there's any great productivity advantage to being uncomfortable.
And my husband is a casual dresser, himself. Although our closet is spilling over with ties of every description, he rarely wears one to work. Why should he? It's not required -- in fact, it might even be looked upon with suspicion. These days, dressing too well for work might well signify you'll be slipping out at lunchtime in search of a better job.
So what's wrong with the tie-less look? My husband's point -- well taken -- is this: It's phony. It's meant not so much to provide comfort as to telegraph a message about relationships. "Look at me," it says, "I'm just one of the guys. Don't stand on ceremony with me!" The tie-less executive is a bit like the millionaire politician in work boots. The boots have a specific purpose, and the purpose has nothing to do with doing the dirty work. It's all about spin.
This message is part and parcel of other messages we're hearing from hip corporations these days. Hierarchies are flattened! Vacations are unlimited! Work should be fun!
What's wrong with messages like these? They mask a much harsher truth. Many Americans are working longer hours and taking fewer vacations than at any time in recent history. How truly flat a "non-hierarchical organization" can become remains to be seen, but it's certainly true that many employees today go to work without any certainty they'll have a job tomorrow -- something yesterday's employees, in hierarchical companies with tie-wearing executives -- rarely faced. Far from being "just one of the guys (or gals)," today's CEOs may preside over companies that have unprecedented control over employees' lives -- all the while earning salaries on average 350 times more than their worker-bee "chums." And is it a coincidence that the rise of the tie-less executive has corresponded to the steepest decline in union membership since the Great Depression? Or that so-called "right to work" laws, which many believe amount to dressed-up (pun intended) union-busting, are on the rise around the country ?
Look, like I said, I'm all for casual dress. And, as any regular reader of my blog knows, I'm all for innovative thinking around company programs and policies. I believe there are many companies that try to do the right thing by their employees, and I applaud them. I certainly don't think the answer is a return to Don Draper/Peggy Olsen formality. But I do think my husband has a point.
It's vital that when we see the popular image of a roll-up-your-sleeves, one-of-the-guys CEOs, we see it for what it is: a silly bit of spin. He may not be wearing a tie, but he still holds the reins.

Peril of skimping on public healthNovember 9, 2014 2:15 pm
We play with fire if we skimp on public health
Lawrence Summers
Ebola was a ‘stress test’ on health systems, and Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea could not cope
©AP
Epidemics and pandemics are like earthquakes. Tragic, inevitable and unpredictable. It starts as a random event. A virus jumps species from a bird, bat, or other animal to “Patient Zero” – who passes it on to other human beings. More likely than not, over the course of this century we will face an influenza pandemic similar to the one in 1918 that killed 50m people.
The FT’s A-List
The A-List provides timely, insightful comment on the topics that matter, from globally renowned leaders, policy makers and commentators
President Barack Obama’s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said in the wake of the global economic meltdown that “you never let a serious crisis go to waste”. Crises are opportunities to learn. They point to measures that will prevent the collapse of institutions when they are under extreme pressure.
While the focus is understandably on responding to the Ebola crisis, it is equally important that it serves as a wake-up call with respect to inadequacies that threaten not just tragedy on an unprecedented scale but the basic security of the US and other wealthy nations. As with climate change, no part of the world can insulate itself from the consequences of epidemic and pandemic.
The report of the Global Health 2035 commission, which I co-chaired, points up three crucial lessons. First, collective action must be taken to build strong health systems in every corner of the globe. In west Africa, Ebola was a “stress test” on national health systems, and in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea the systems could not cope. There were too few trained health professionals; there was also too little equipment and too few supplies, and too little capacity for public health surveillance and control.
More
Reform as the answer
Nigeria’s containment of the virus after the first case was diagnosed in July is instructive. Its success, hailed by the World Health Organisation as a piece of “world class epidemiological detective work”, is explained by its aggressive, co-ordinated surveillance and control response. It already had a polio surveillance system, with skilled outbreak specialists who were quickly put to work tackling Ebola. While much of Nigeria’s health system, such as primary care services, remains very weak, on Ebola the surveillance and control system worked. Every country needs this kind of system. Prevention is cheaper than cure and leads to better outcomes.
Building these systems takes time and money. Our research, conducted with an international team of economists and health experts, and published last year in the medical journal The Lancet, suggests that the price of this “systems strengthening” would be about $30bn a year for the next two decades. The good news is that we have the financing to pay for this through a combination of aid and domestic spending. The cost represents well under 1 per cent of the additional gross domestic product that will be available to low- and lower-middle-income countries due to increased GDP growth over the next 20 years.
The second lesson is that the lack of investment in public health is a global emergency. The WHO’s slow response to Ebola was not surprising, given its recent staff cuts. For that, we all share the blame. Since 1994, the WHO’s regular budget has declined steadily in real terms. Even before the Ebola crisis, it struggled to fund basic functions. The entire budget for influenza was just $7·7m in 2013 – less than a third of what New York City alone devotes to preparing for public health emergencies.
It takes just one infected airline passenger to introduce an infection into a country. We need the WHO more than ever. It alone has the mandate and legitimacy to serve as a health protection agency for all countries, rich and poor. Starving it of funds is reckless.
The third lesson concerns scientific innovation. When it comes to discovering and developing medicines, vaccines and diagnostic tests, we have been largely ignoring the infectious diseases that disproportionately kill the world’s poor. Consequently, we still have no medicines or vaccine for Ebola. All we can do is provide basic life support, such as fluids and blood pressure treatment. For prevention, we have to rely on old-fashioned measures such as quarantine.
Margaret Chan, the WHO’s director-general, has explained the reason for this neglect. Doctors were “empty-handed”, she said, because “a profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay”. Ebola affects poor African nations, so drug companies see no profit in working on it. Nor is there an adequate incentive to invest in prevention. No society will allow companies to reap huge profits when disease is spreading rapidly.
Rich governments and donors need to step up. Investing several billion dollars a year, less than 0.01 per cent of global GDP, could be decisive in preventing tragedy on the scale of world war.
Some issues are even more important than recessions and elections. Ebola is a tragedy. Let us hope that it will also be a spur to taking the necessary steps to prevent the far greater one that is nearly inevitable on the current policy trajectory. The next Ebola is just around the corner.

Shale Oil: All you wanted to know aboutShale Oil: All you wanted to know about
ANAND KALYANARAMAN
Tweet
November 10, 2014:  
In an unexpected stroke of good luck for you, me and the country, the price of crude oil has fallen from $115 a barrel in June all the way down to $84. This has meant cheaper petrol and diesel, and a lower subsidy bill for the Government. One big factor responsible for this price fall is the unexpected increase in oil produced from shale in the US.
What is it?
Shale oil is essentially crude oil but an unconventional one at that. While the conventional fuel is usually found in porous rocks such as sandstone, shale oil is trapped in shale rock formations that are not easily permeable and hence is tougher to tap. So though its existence has been known for long, shale oil wasn’t being extracted in large quantities.
But technological advancements — horizontal drilling and fracturing (fracking) — introduced and honed since the early part of the century have enabled shale oil exploration and production on an industrial scale.
Most of the action in shale oil so far has been in the US where explorers have struck copious quantities of the black gold. It has not been smooth sailing though. Environmentalists and local communities have been up in arms against the pollution caused to land and water bodies by the chemicals used in the fracking process.
Nevertheless, shale oil produced in the country has grown by leaps and bounds over the years. So the dependence of the US — the largest oil consumer in the world — on imported crude oil has fallen sharply. And this has added to the weakness of global crude oil price in recent months.
Conventional crude oil producers such as Saudi Arabia have been cutting prices to maintain their market share and to drive some of the high cost shale oil producers out of action.
But whether this will have the desired effect remains to be seen — technological improvements are expected to push down the cost of shale oil production.
Also, while Saudi Arabia might have the financial muscle to sustain low prices for quite some time, other conventional producers such as Venezuela and Nigeria may likely find it difficult to hold out.
Why is it important?
Shale oil has the potential to be a massive game-changer in global energy supply and pricing — with enormous geopolitical implications. It’s not just the US; countries such as Russia, China and Argentina are also believed to have vast stores of shale oil. India too is taking baby steps to find and explore its shale assets potential.
Progress in other nations has been quite slow so far. But there’s no saying when the inflection point will be reached. If production continues to expand, countries such as the US could start exporting oil in a few years.
Why should I care?
For starters, more shale oil means lower petrol and diesel prices. So you spend less on travel.
Cheaper crude oil also reduces India’s current account deficit and subsidy bill and will also give a boost to the country’s GDP — that means more and better-paying jobs, and more profitable businesses. But shale oil production in India in the future could also mean more environmental challenges. So the right trade-off needs to be made.
The bottomline
Hope all shale be well!

Australia put cigarettes in standardized packs with graphic labels -- and theyre workingBy Abby Phillip November 12 Follow @abbydphillip
Packs of Philip Morris Marlboro Menthol cigarettes in the new packaging are arranged for a photograph at a tobacco store in Melbourne, Australia. (Carla Gottgens/Bloomberg News)
Australia's Parliament in 2011 became the first legislature in the world to mandate new plain, uniform packaging for cigarettes that included large graphic warning labels about the health risks of smoking.
The move was intended to reduce the appeal of smoking by making cigarette brands virtually indistinguishable from one another and to highlight the negative health effects. 
The road from conception to implementation took about two years, delayed by legal hurdles and efforts to secure Parliament's stamp of approval. But toward the end of 2012, the new olive green packs with large, graphic images of the ravages of mouth cancer or gangrene hit the shelves.
Unsurprisingly, smokers hated them.
Support for the measure was a paltry 28 percent and it was more likely to come from people who expressed a strong desire to quit smoking.
But a new study of public opinion surrounding the policy change that was released this week in the journal Tobacco Control  found a dramatic shift since the labels were introduced.
Now, 49 percent of smokers support the new packaging -- as gruesome as it is -- compared with about 35 percent who oppose them.
And more surprisingly, they were more likely to go from opposing the packaging to supporting it if they wanted to quit smoking before the packaging went into effect.
Those who oppose the packs were more likely to be heavy smokers and those who underestimated the potential risks of smoking. Support for the packs, on the other hand, was associated with quitting activity.
Other indicators that have emerged recently from Australia's experiment seem to confirm those general findings.
As my colleague Roberto Ferdman notes , the new packaging appears to have coincided with a slew of positive developments in terms of smoking cessation:
Shortly after the new law was implemented, calls to Quitline, a helpline for those looking to quit smoking, spiked  by nearly 80 percent . None of the tobacco industry's warnings about the potential for increases in purchases of illicit, unbranded tobacco have proven clairvoyant — the proportion of smokers purchasing such types of tobacco is actually decreasing,  according to a study conducted last month . And while some have pointed to upticks in cigarette sales as evidence that the legislation hasn't, in fact, worked, last year's increase — which came in at  0.3 percent  — is likely an outlier (it was the first in more than five years). Also last year, there was a much more substantial decrease in the actual number of people smoking in the country. The number of people who smoke fell by 3 percent last year, dropping the smoking rate in Australia to well below 15 percent.
Unlike Australia, the United States was never able to overcome industry -- and smoker -- opposition to startling warning labels.
This handout image courtesy of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), shows a man in a coffin with a warning that says: "Smoking can kill you." The images were supposed to cover cigarette labels in 2012 but the FDA abandoned the effort due to opposition from the Tobacco industry. (Handout/AFP/Getty Images)
After the Food and Drug Administration proposed labels (like this one of a man in a coffin) for cigarette packages, a federal judge ruled the move was unconstitutional in 2012 . The FDA then abandoned the effort in 2013. 
It is unclear what can be done to overcome the constitutional objections to the labels. But evidence that they reduce smoking, increase cessation efforts and reduce cigarette sales probably won't help get the tobacco industry on board.

TV rediscovers nicenessBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 12 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
Grant Gustin as Barry Allen in “The Flash.” (Jack Rowand/The CW)
For a long time, most prominent television shows have drawn their dramatic juice from the idea that all characters have big, bad secrets. The waste management consultant who is really a mobster has a wife who is having a discrete emotional affair with his bodyguard. If a prisoner of war returned to the United States is a sleeper agent who plans to kill the vice president of the United States, of course the CIA agent investigating him must have bipolar disorder. Ambitious U.S. congressmen kill alcoholics in their cars and have threesomes with their Secret Service protection.
If these double lives were interesting, their proliferation sapped the power of these stories, sometimes irreparably. The idea that darkness was the only sophisticated tone to lend a story made TV feel like a drag a lot of the time, and the prevailing gloom lent a revolutionary air to alternatives like “Parks and Recreation,” which insisted week after week that well-meaning, fundamentally good people could still be engaging to watch on screen, and that audiences genuinely wanted to root for someone.
It is one thing for a dogged little comedy to make that argument. But, delightfully, two of fall’s best new dramas have taken up the charge. “ The Flash ” and “ Jane the Virgin ” are running creative laps around their grimmer competitors by demonstrating that the conflicts produced by good intentions are just as gripping as the misdeeds of people who conceal their worst selves rather than conquering them.
“Jane the Virgin,” as Margaret Lyons described it , is “a telenovela on the CW, and it’s about a pregnant virgin who, thanks to a distracted gynecologist, was accidentally inseminated with the sperm of a rich, unhappy hotelier, Rafael. You know, dramz.” But what distinguishes “Jane” from its competitors is not just its tone and its willingness to be slightly antic, but something that makes it different from other telenovelas as well: The show is constantly encouraging us to give all of its characters the benefit of the doubt.
And I mean all of its characters. Jane Villanueva (the marvelous Gina Rodriguez) is an easy sell. As the title suggests, she is a virgin (but not a prude) who is trying to make the best of her surprising situation, balancing the needs of her fiancé Michael (Brett Dier) with those of hotel magnate Rafael (Justin Baldoni), whose child she is carrying (he had cancer and Jane’s pregnancy is his last chance to become a father).
But “Jane the Virgin” extends that charity to characters who are doing less-well. Xiomara (Andrea Navedo) turns out to have concealed the identity of Jane’s father, Rogelio (Jamie Camil), now a successful telenovela star out of fear Rogelio would try to claim custody. Rogelio, by turn, seems like a pompous goat, but he’s profoundly afraid of wrecking his fledgling relationship with the daughter he only recently learned he had. Rafael turns out to be a former playboy who is afraid of losing the substantive career he built for himself. And while his wife Petra (Yael Grobglas) was cheating on Rafael with his best friend, who in grand telenovela style is murdered via ice scuplture, “Jane” even manages to give her some pathos in the form of lost happiness and an impossible mother.
“The Flash,” which also airs on the CW, is a spin-off of a typically dark superhero show – albeit one with redeeming character work – “Arrow.” But unlike tortured billionaire Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) in the predecessor show, “The Flash” centers on Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), a cheerful scientist who works as a crime scene investigator.
There is tragedy in Barry’s past: His mother was murdered when he was a child, and his father, who Barry believes is innocent, was incarcerated for the crime. But unlike so many other superheroes (including Oliver), Barry is not defined solely by his tragedy. He has a close relationship with Joe West (Jesse L. Martin), the detective who raised Barry when his father went to jail, and Joe’s daughter Iris (Candice Patton). When he acquires superpowers, Barry’s reaction is exuberant and joyful. If you suddenly became the fastest man in the world, wouldn’t you want to take your new skills out for a spin?
This being a crime series, “The Flash” does not bother to try to make everyone sympathetic. And trouble is surely brewing in the form of Dr. Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh), Barry’s patron, who proves to have a nasty temper in private.
But at its best, “The Flash” is fair and kind about the mistakes people make when the stakes are as high as they inevitably are when superpowers are involved. In one episode, Barry finds himself under attack from an adversary with a weapon that can slow him down, and that turns out to have been designed by Cisco (Carlos Valdes), part of Barry’s support team. Cisco’s sad confession that he was afraid and the weapon was his way of handling his mistrust of what Barry might do or become lands harder than a high-speed punch.
There is evil in the world, of course. And I am glad that television has proved itself capable of addressing the big questions that once might have been reserved for film and literature, if they were considered suitable for fictional treatment at all. But now that showrunners have demonstrated that they can plumb the worst of humanity, and then imagine even deeper depths, it is delightful to see others set their hands to a task that others have ignored: exploring niceness and kindness in all of its texture. There is just as much to see in the sunshine as in the darkness.

Traders of major banks fined $4.3 billion Wednesday for attempted manipulation of foreign exchange markets used electronic chat rooms to plot their moves.
Transcript excerpts of conversations released Wednesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show traders from U.S. banks Citibank ( C ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), coordinated their currency trades with colleagues at Swiss banking giant UBS ( UBS ), London-based HSBC ( HSBC ) and other financial institutions.
Banks fined $4.3B in foreign exchange probe
The cryptic chats feature references to "cable" trades — shorthand for transactions involving the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate. The excerpts also show the traders often colluded to focus their moves on the daily 4 p.m. London time market "fix" — the most widely referenced time when world foreign exchange benchmarks are set.
Traders also used the code "lhs" or left-hand side if they had orders to sell the first currency listed in the currency pair transaction under discussion, and "rhs" or right-hand side if they had orders to sell the second currency listed in that pair.
One exchange, featuring participants from Citibank, JPMorgan and Swiss bank UBS, showed traders at one point speaking more like mob conspirators than bank employees as they discuss whether to invite a fourth trader into a private chat room:
UBS Trader: 7:49:55 are we ok with keeping this as is
7:50:27 ie the info lvls & risk sharing?
Citibank Trader: 7:50:27 well…
UBS Trader: 7:50:30 that is the qu[estion]
Citibank Trader: 7:50:32 you know him best obv…
7:50:39 if you think we need to adjust it
7:50:43 then he shouldn't be[] in chat
JPMorgan Trader: 7:50:54 yeah that is key
7:51:00 simple question [UBS trader]
7:51:08 I trust you implicitly [UBS trader]
7:51:13 and your judgement
7:51:21 will he tell rest of desk stuff
7:51:26 or god forbin his nyk…
Citibank Trader: 7:51:46 yes
7:51:51 that's really imp[ortant] q[uestion]
7:52:01 dont want other numpty's in mkt to know
7:52:17 but not only that
7:52:21 is he gonna protect us
7:52:33 like we protect each other against our own branches
7:52:46 ie if you guys are rhs1
.. and my nyk is lhs..ill say my nyk lhs in few
UBS Trader: 7:53:52 what concerns me is that i know he'll never tell us when at risk…
Following further discussion about whether the fourth trader would "add huge value to this cartell," the group decided to invite the trader into the chat room for a "1 month trial." The Citibank trader issued what investigators characterized as a presumably facetious warning: "Mess this up and sleep with one eye open at night."
In another chat room, a trader for HSBC and a trader for another institution identified as Bank W discussed unloading their trading positions just before the fix period, starting at 3:54 p.m.:
Bank W Trader 3: 3:54:32 pm: can u let me know when are down to your last tenner
HSBC Trader: 3:55:02 pm: ok
HSBC Trader: 3:55:10 pm: i'm down to my last tenner
Bank W Trader 3: 3:55:17 pm: ok ta
Bank W Trader 3: 3:55:41 pm: just sold some more
HSBC Trader: 3:55:49 pm: hahaha
Bank W Trader 3: 3:55:51 pm: hehehe
Bank W Trader 3: 4:00:57 pm: nice on[e] son
HSBC Trader: 4:03:15 pm: learnt from a good fella
Bank W Trader 3: 4:15:43 pm: there u go
Bank W Trader 3: 4:16:48 pm: go early, move it, hold it, push it
And yet another excerpt shows that traders from two banks teamed up in an alleged effort to manipulate the daily foreign exchange fix.
At 3:43:50 p.m. London time, a trader from Bank W asked a trader from JPMorgan whether he needed to buy euros in the market in the forthcoming fix. The JPMorgan trader responded that he had a net buy order for the fix, which he subsequently confirmed as totaling 105 million euros.
At 3:44:04 p.m. the JPMorgan trader offered to transfer that net buy order to the Bank W trader. The Bank W trader replied "maybe" and then stated that he had a net buy order for 150 million euros.
Bank W Trader: 3:46:53 i'd prefer we join forces
JPMorgan Trader: 3:46:56 perfick
JPMorgan Trader: 3:47:11 lets double team them
Bank W Trader: 3:47:12 YESssssssssssss
Immediately after the fixing window, the traders congratulated themselves.
Bank W Trader: 4:03:25 sml rumour we haven't lost it
JPMorgan Trader: 4:03:45 we
4:03:46 do
4:03:48 dollarrr
Dozens of foreign exchange traders at major banks were placed on leave or terminated during investigations of the market manipulation, according to statements by the banks and media reports. In the wake of Wednesday's enforcement actions, some traders could face individual charges as investigators in the U.S. and Europe continue their probes.
Amid the investigations, banks took steps to monitor traders' use of chat rooms and bar improper behavior and disclosures during exchanges. The FCA said it is "especially important that firms exercise appropriate control and monitoring of such communications."

5 Congress MLAs suspended for injuring Governor C Vidyasagar Rao

(The committee will probe…)
MUMBAI: Five Congress MLAs were today suspended from Maharashtra Assembly for two years for causing injury to Governor C Vidyasagar Rao when they tried to block his entry into the House to address a joint sitting of the bicameral legislature.
A resolution moved by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prakash Mehta seeking to suspend Rahul Bondre , Abdul Sattar , Amar Kale , Virendra Jagtap and Jaikumar Gore was passed by the the House by voice vote.
The MLAs were protesting against "unconstitutional" manner in which the motion of confidence in the Devendra Fadnavis government was passed by voice vote instead of a division vote.
While moving the resolution, Mehta said the five MLAs had got close to the Governor and apparently jostled with him, injuring his hand. "Their action has lowered the dignity of the august House," he said.
Senior BJP MLA Girish Bapat said a committee headed by Speaker Haribhau Bagde has been constituted to probe the incident.
The panel includes Leader of Opposition Eknath Shinde, Congress Legislature Party leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, senior PWP legislator Ganpatrao Deshmukh, Prakash Mehta, besides Bapat.
The committee will probe the incident and submit its report next month. The decision on whether to continue or revoke the suspension will be taken during the winter session of the state legislature in Nagpur, also beginning next month.
Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse said two officials of the legislature were also injured in the melee.
"Governor's left hand was injured. The issue does not end with an apology. This should not be tolerated," Khadse said before the motion for suspension was moved.
Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said there was no intention to hurt anyone but he was prepared to apologise.
Ajit Pawar, R R Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal of NCP said the matter should be put to rest after an apology, if the report of Governor getting injured was true.
Today is the first day of the new Assembly and it should not start on a bitter note, they said.

Rosetta and Philae are breaking our hearts on TwitterBy Rachel Feltman November 12 Follow @rachelfeltman
This animation explains how, after a decade-long journey, the Rosetta satellite will land on Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. (ESA)
Look, it's great that the Rosetta spacecraft separated from its lander, Philae. It had to happen: Philae is currently falling towards the surface of a comet, getting ready to make history by landing on it. It's already collecting new data on the comet as it descends, and once it lands (fingers crossed!) it's going to do some intense forensic analysis of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko -- which could help scientists understand the origins of our solar system.
But Philae and Rosetta are live-tweeting their separation, and it's giving me a lot of feelings.
They made their preparations:

High revenue neutral rate will cripple trade  industry: FicciNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Revenue-neutral rates of nearly 27 per cent as suggested by a GST sub-committee would cripple the trade and industry besides burdening consumers, Ficci said today.
“It is disturbing to note that a panel set up by the Empowered Committee of state Finance Ministers has proposed Revenue Neutral Rates (RNRs) aggregating to nearly 27 per cent for the proposed Goods and Service Tax.”
“A GST rate close to 27 per cent would cripple the trade and industry besides burdening the consumers. It will entirely negate the perceived advantages of GST,” the industry body said.
The Empowered Committee of state Finance Ministers, which met yesterday, reviewed the revenue neutral rate for the GST, comprising C-GST and S-GST, as suggested by a GST sub-panel.
The sub-committee had suggested S-GST rate at 13.91 per cent and C-GST rate at 12.77 per cent, which aggregates to almost 27 per cent.
“Considering that the Kelkar Committee on fiscal consolidation had recommended a rate of 14 per cent and the Task Force appointed by the 13th Finance Commission had suggested a rate of 12 per cent, prima facie the proposed rates appear to be highly excessive. Even the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy is reported to have suggested a rate between 12 and 20 per cent,” Ficci said.
“Though the aforesaid rate is yet to be ratified, the findings of the panel set up by the Standing Committee should be immediately made public so that these can be analysed by the stakeholders to determine whether the outcomes are based on reliable data and a rational analysis,” it added.
The proposed GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
“The trade and industry so far has not been updated on the status of various aspects of proposed GST like threshold limits, rates, items under the Negative List, GST compliance, the IT infrastructure, the administrative structure etc.”
“Government should come out with a paper on the latest status of the proposed GST incorporating the decisions which have been finalized between the Central Government and the states,” the industry body.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.

Police unable to identify Union minister Nihal Chands address to deliversummonsPrint
Written by Sweta Dutta | Jaipur | Posted: November 12, 2014 8:56 pm
The alleged rape of a 20-year-old woman involving Union Minister Nihal Chand Meghwal is stuck in ‘identification of residences’ with the police unable to identify the ‘correct addresses’ of the accused to deliver the court summons. Meghwal and six others out of the total 17 accused in the case appeared through their lawyers before a lower court on Wednesday citing suo moto cognizance of the court hearing through media reports. They told the court that no summons was served on them.
The court was told by the local police that the exact residential addresses of five accused named in the revision petition have not been mentioned by the victim, hence they could not be traced. The Vaishali Nagar police station cited ‘work pressure’ for not being able to look for the prime accused Om Prakash Godara, the alleged victim’s husband. Former MLA Yogeshwar Garg also could not be found at the given rented accommodation while his son Prakash Punj Garg, also named in the case, appeared through a lawyer.
The court in its previous hearing on August 20 had asked Ganganagar Superintendent of Police to find Union Minister Meghwal and ensure that the summons is delivered to him, be it in Ganganagar or New Delhi. As Meghwal’s lawyer, AK Jain, appeared in court, he maintained that the summons was not served on him but he had taken suo moto cognizance of the case hearing and appeared on behalf of Meghwal. The SP did not appear for the hearing or send any representative to explain why the summons could not be delivered.
Since all the accused or their representatives could not appear for the hearing on Wednesday, the court was adjourned for next hearing on December 6.
“As responsible citizens we have taken suo moto cognizance of the court hearing and appeared. The summons was not delivered to Meghwal. It is a fabricated case. In February this year, the magistrate court had dismissed the case as false and baseless. It is a revision petition. The alleged victim should have furnished the residential and other identification details of the accused, which she has been unable to do so far,” AK Jain told the Indian Express.
Chandu Ram Yadav, the victim’s lawyer, said, “It is not the victim’s job to locate the accused. The police should do it. These names were mentioned right from the beginning of the case. The police has done nothing in the case so far. How can the victim be expected to look up each of the accused and where they live currently?”

PM Modi to meet Chinese counterpart Li KeqiangtomorrowPrint

PM Narendra Modi will have his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang on Thursday afternoon on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit here.
Li was the first foreign leader to have spoken with Modi on the telephone following his swearing-in in May, with the two sharing a 30-minute telephone call. The Chinese prime minister had reportedly pledged then to build a “robust” relationship with the new NDA government.
Li is second-ranked in the Communist Party of China (CPC) after President Xi Jinping and as Premier, Li holds the reins of the Chinese economy and has a more direct role in executing policy as the head of the Chinese State Council or Cabinet.
Although President Xi’s India visit in September was seen as having been somewhat overshadowed by the stand-off in Chumar along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the positives from the visit included the $20 billion investment pledge from China and steps to move forward agreements such as the setting up of China-dedicated industrial parks in India.
Beijing and New Delhi have clashed over relations with the neighbours in recent weeks, with China expressing concern over India’s naval plans with Vietnam, while India has cited worries over the docking of a Chinese submarine at the Colombo harbour.
Apart from Li, Modi is slated to meet Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the new President of Indonesia Joko Widodo and the Prime Minister of Laos at the sidelines of the East Asia Summit on Thursday.

PANAJI: Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said the country need not worry about Pakistan and China, but needed to build the defence capabilities over the next three years.
Assuring that there would be transparency in the functioning of his ministry, he also said that crucial defence purchases would be fast-tracked.
"I have realised that if someone properly heads the defence ministry, then we need not worry about Pakistan and China. We are strong enough...we have to build our capability over the next two-three years," said Parrikar, who visited his home state today after joining the Union Cabinet on Sunday.
"We need to provide the armed forces the required logistical support. Prime Minister has given me the responsibility to provide all the support to defence forces. I am feeling more responsible because the defence deals are worth Rs one lakh crore," he said, talking to the reporters.
Parrikar said he would ensure transparency in the defence purchases and the functioning of his ministry, which he said were crucial for the strengthening of the forces.
"All the purchases which are immediately required would be fast-tracked," he added.

Rusted instruments at sterilisation camp caused deathsAt least a dozen women dead after Chhattisgarh sterilisation camps
Reuters –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014
Print
By Aditya Kalra
RAIPUR India (Reuters) - Nem Bai was told getting a tubectomy would be an easy process -that she'd be home by sunset, a few hundred rupees richer and back to work in the fields within two days.
Instead, the 35-year-old mother-of-five was incapacitated within hours of the surgery at a mass sterilisation camp in Chhattisgarh on Saturday, her widower told Reuters. She was one of at least 12 women who have died since.
"The entire night she was in tremendous pain," said Ramavtar Suryavanshi, while waiting in his village for his wife's body to be delivered from the hospital.
By early morning, when Suryavanshi rushed Bai to a private hospital nearby, his wife was unable to speak. Within 20 minutes of being admitted to intensive care, she was dead.
Scores more remain in hospital and several are critically ill after the operations performed on Saturday by a doctor accused of using rusty equipment in a dirty operating room, highlighting dangers in the world's largest surgical contraception programme.
Two days later, another camp was held in the same Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh. One woman died and more than a dozen fell ill with shock and vomiting, senior police officer Sonmani Borah said.
The survivors from the two camps are spread between several clinics and there was confusion among officials over exactly how many women had died. One senior local official put the toll at 13, while others said it was 12.
POPULATION GROWTH
R.K. Gupta, an experienced doctor, performed more than 80 surgeries on Saturday, police say.
A different doctor carried out the operations at the second camp, said Pratap Singh, commissioner of Chhattisgarh's Department of Health and Family Welfare.
Such camps are held regularly as part of a long-running effort to control population growth.
The cause of the deaths was not clear, but officials said victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly because of dirty equipment or contaminated medicines. A hospital official said that some of survivors may be suffering kidney problems.
"Preliminary reports show that the medicines administered were spurious and also the equipment used was rusted," senior local government official Siddharth Komal Singh Pardeshi told Reuters.
Gupta's mass sterilisation took less than three hours with the help of two assistants working in a dirty, abandoned private hospital, officials said, and contravened guidelines to limit such operations to 30 a day.
A seven-member team of doctors from New Delhi arrived in the district on Wednesday to investigate what went wrong, and the local government registered with the police a case of causing death by negligence against Gupta.
Local media said Gupta blamed medicine the women were later given and denied making mistakes. He could not be reached by Reuters for comment.
STATE OF SHOCK
Many of the women were paid 1,400 rupees ($23) for the surgery, officials said. Health workers also received smaller payments for bringing women to the camp.
"I would have been happier if they gave her the right treatment instead of giving her the money," said Suryavanshi, the widower. His youngest child is three months old, and was breast fed by Bai.
He said health workers told his wife the procedure was safe and that thousands of women undergo the operation.
Sterilisation is the most popular form of birth control in India. Encouraged by cash incentives, about 4 million people a year undergo surgery. Almost all are women.
In Chhattisgarh, one of India's poorest states, the government had a target to carry out 165,000 female sterilisations and 26,000 male sterilisations in 2013-14, according to government documents.
Some members of India's medical establishment and activists say targets make the sterilisation programme coercive.
Investigating officer S.N. Shukla said all the women who were operated on Saturday had signed written consent. That is in line with national standards that also say consent should be not obtained under coercion or while the patient is sedated.
Tubectomies are considered major surgeries, but doctors often exceed limits. Before guidelines were set there were reports of doctors performing 200 surgeries a day, said Suneeta Mittal, head of gynaecology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute near New Delhi.
Operations at the camps are conducted in minutes, with little time to maintain hygiene. Nearly 600 deaths were reported between 2009 and 2012, according to the government.
The deaths are an embarrassment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose political party rules in Chhattisgarh. He has vowed to reform India's health system. Modi expressed concern over the tragedy on Tuesday.

New Delhi, November 12:  
Following the BJP winning the trust vote in Maharashtra with the NCP abstaining from voting, the Congress on Wednesday questioned the former’s “double standards”.
The Congress asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to explain his party’s attitude towards the NCP, a UPA ally.
Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmed recalled that during the Maharashtra Assembly poll campaign, Modi had termed the NCP a ‘Naturally Corrupt Party’.
“He should tell the people if he had changed his perception about the NCP,” Ahmed said, asking Modi to make his stand clear on the issue of corruption.
When asked about the NCP’s change of stand, Ahmed said the party was in a “secular” alliance for 15 years. “We do not know why they have decided to align with the BJP,” he said.
The Congress leader, however, said the NCP has been invited to attend the international seminar as part of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s birth anniversary celebrations.
“We had invited all parties who believe in secularism and inclusive ideologies,” he added.
The decision to help the BJP to form government in Maharashtra has created problems within the NCP too. NCP leaders from various States have reportedly questioned the move.

OVL profit rises 9.6% to Rs 2,068 cr in April-Sept

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), on Wednesday reported a 9.6 per cent rise in net profit on the back of surge in oil and gas output.
Net profit in April-September rose 9.65 per cent to Rs 2,068 crore as compared to Rs 1,886 crore in the same period a year ago, the company said in a statement. OVL is an unlisted firm and does not give quarterly earning numbers.
Crude oil production rose 1.2 per cent to 2.74 million tonnes while gas output soared 10.43 per cent to 1.557 billion cubic meters. Revenue was up nearly 13 per cent to Rs 11,362 crore.
“Crude oil production during H1 FY’15 is slightly higher by 1.22 per cent due to the commissioning of phase II in Block BC-10, Brazil as well as acquisition of additional 12 per cent interest in the block and increase in production in Carabobo, Venezuela which was offset by temporary shutdown of production in South Sudan.
“The gas production has increased by 10.43 per cent mainly due to production from Blocks A1 and A3, Myanmar,” it said.
OVL said India received first cargo of around 1.2 million barrels of diluted crude oil from its Carabobo Project located in the oil-rich Orinoco belt in Venezuela. Reliance Industries bought the cargo.
The Carabobo project is operated by Petrocarabobo S.A., a joint venture company in which OVL has 11 per cent stake. Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corporation have 3.5 per cent stake each; while Repsol of Spain and Venezuela’s PDVSA have 11 per cent and 71 per cent stakes, respectively.

After snub to Modi  Cong invites Mamata  NitishAkhilesh Yadav wants equal participation of states, Centre
After refusing to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress has now called leaders including Mamata Banerjee and Nitish Kumar for an event on Jawaharlal Nehru next week, a move seen as an attempt to consolidate secular parties.
Congress President Sonia Gandhi had last week formally invited NCP chief Sharad Pawar for the event but the party now seems to be in two minds after NCP today supported the BJP government in the trust vote in Maharashtra.
On his part, Pawar has already expressed his inability to attend the event owing to NCP’s Maharashtra unit’s two-day convention at Alibag which coincides with the Congress event.
“Sonia Gandhi had written a letter inviting Pawar on November 6 and, on the same day, he wrote back expressing his inability to attend the event,” said NCP general secretary D P Tripathi.
Congress had yesterday made it clear it has not invited the prime minister for the event, joining the battle with Modi, who it accuses of trying to appropriate freedom movement leaders.
Party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed today said that Congress has invited leaders of all Left parties, JD(U), RJD, Trinamool Congress and other parties “who believe in the idea of India” as espoused by Nehru.
Asked whether it will also invite Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP, he said, “They are now with NDA. We have not invited those who do not believe in Nehru’s ideas.”
Party sources said that the Congress chief had personally written to Mamata and Kumar inviting them for the event.
The two-day event to highlight the legacy and worldview of the first Prime Minister is being organised on November 17 and 18 and will be attended by a host of international leaders and representatives of various political parties from India and abroad.
The event is being held separately by Congress even as the government has already indicated that it will organise Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary this year in a mega way to increase awareness about ‘Chacha Nehru’ through a number of initiatives like organising ‘Year of Bal Swachhta’.

Iranian stake hurts IOC s revival plan: Chai...Iranian stake hurts Indian Oil Corp's revival plan, says chairman B Ashok

(IOC, the country's biggest…)
NEW DELHI: Indian Oil Corp (IOC) , the country's biggest refiner, is exploring options including a merger to save loss-making unit Chennai Petroleum Corp (CPCL), its chairman B. Ashok told Reuters on Wednesday.
CPCL's attempts to raise funds have been constrained due to a 15.4 percent stake held in it by a unit of Iran's Naftiran Inter Trade Co Ltd (NICO). Western sanctions against Tehran due to its nuclear programme have made businesses difficult for companies with ties to Iran.
"At the moment there are certain difficulties," Ashok said. "CPCL requires infusion of funds and we are looking at various options including a merger of CPCL with IOC."
CPCL has informed the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, a government body that identifies sick firms, about a significant reduction in its net worth due to volatile oil prices and forex losses in the year ended March 31.
The company in May planned a rights issue to raise up to 10 billion rupees ($163 million) but abandoned it after NICO said it wanted to subscribe to the shares and maintain its holding.
Sanctions have toughened monetary transactions with Iran, making it difficult for the Indian company to raise funds from the market or allow parent IOC to infuse funds.
CPCL, whose two refineries can process 230,000 barrels per day of oil and account for about 5.4 percent of India's total capacity, could not pay dividends to NICO in 2010/11 and 2011/12 due to the sanctions, it said in its annual report.
The refiner stopped processing Iranian oil in 2012 after losing insurance for those supplies, while cover for crude imports from other countries was cut due to its ties with the Iranian firm.
ICO has initiated steps to build a 5 million-tonnes-a-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Ennore in the country's east coast by the end of 2017 or early 2018, Ashok said. The company owns a 45 percent stake in the LNG project.
"We are talking to various parties ... we will give a stake to whoever adds value to the project," Ashok said.
IOC plans to buy 0.7 million tonnes annually of LNG from the Cameron LNG plant in Lousiana where Japan's Mitsubishi has a stake. It will buy 1.2 million tonnes from Petronas' British Columbia project in which it has a 10 percent stake.

Wait 1 second to continue.
After 10 years of hard work and one nerve-wracking night, the Rosetta mission has made history by landing on the surface of a comet.
The lander Philae was confirmed to touch down on the surface of the comet more than 300 million miles away at 11:03 a.m. Eastern. Now, scientists expect it to send a panoramic image home and begin analyzing the comet for scientists back on Earth.
Philae is already transmitting scientific data back home, but we're still waiting to see whether the probe is in a stable position. Until we know it's anchored tight, it could roll onto its back and never get back up.
Tensions were high in the European Space Agency's German mission control center, especially as the landing window approached. Because the comet that Philae landed on is so far from Earth, there's a communications delay of 28 minutes. So as the minutes ticked by, the Rosetta team knew that Philae had already either landed or failed — and there was nothing they could do but wait for the data to reach them. Those following the video online were nearly as desperate for news, and Twitter became a sounding chamber of anticipation and excitement.
But a few minutes after 11 a.m., the stern, cautious expressions of the mission control team melted into smiles. And just like that, the world swiveled from anxiety to elation: Philae was on the surface of the comet and ready to do some science.

The comet contains the materials that originally formed our solar system, frozen in time. By digging them out, we can learn more about the origins of our planet. The Rosetta spacecraft has made invaluable observations about the comet's attributes, and it will continue to do so as it follows it around the sun for the next year. But Philae will be able to look more closely at the comet's physical and molecular composition.
"It's a look at the basic building blocks of our solar system, the ancient materials from which life emerged," said Kathrin Altwegg of the University of Bern in Switzerland, one of the Rosetta project's lead researchers. "It's like doing archaeology, but instead of going back 1,000 years, we can go back 4.6 billion."
It's no easy thing to land on a comet's surface: These chunks of rock and ice are constantly spinning, and Comet  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which was discovered in 1969, orbits the sun at a speed of about 85,000 mph. It's irregularly shaped — like a toddler's play-dough impression of a duck, or something — and its surface is uneven and pitted. And in a universe of unimaginable proportion, Rosetta's target is just 2.5 miles in diameter — smaller than Northwest Washington's Columbia Heights neighborhood.
So Rosetta has taken an onerous journey to get in sync with the comet's orbit, which would allow it to drop down a lander. In 2004, the spacecraft began what would be three looping orbits around the sun, altering its trajectory as it skimmed Mars, just 150 miles from the surface, and enduring 24 minutes in the planet’s shadow to align with Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The cumulative distance traveled by the craft – with all its looping and gravity assists – is a stunning 4 billion miles . “When the Rosetta signal reappeared after the passage behind Mars, shortly after the end of the ‘shadow’ period, there was a collective sigh of relief,” ESA said .
At one point in 2011, the spacecraft even had to hibernate for nearly three years. It flew so far from the sun — nearly 500 million miles — that its solar panels couldn't leech enough energy to keep the spacecraft operational. But in January of this year, Rosetta woke up, and quickly approached its target.
The last leg of this landing has not been without its bumps. Even as the mission approached its most critical moment, controllers at the European Space Agency on Tuesday night reported a problem with the thruster on the lander that could make for a rough landing. The gravity of the problem — and the extent to which it threatened the mission — remained unknown. “We’ll need some luck not to land on a boulder or a steep slope,” blogged Stephan Ulamec, lander manager for the project.
Following its separation early Wednesday morning, Philae made a seven-hour-long drop to the surface. After successfully making a satellite connection with Rosetta (without which the probe would have been functionally lost), Philae sent home a goodbye picture of its mother-ship.

Then, we watched and waited. We worried we'd have to watch mission control experience the agony of an upside-down rover, lost forever. If the surface of the comet was too hard, the probe might have bounced on impact and landed badly.
"We're looking at the pictures of this comet and interpreting them the way we would somewhere on Earth, because we're just not tuned to understand what they mean for comet geology yet," said Claudia Alexander, the project scientist who's overseeing NASA's many contributions to the effort.
Luckily, the probe's sensors detected a soft landing. But mission control hasn't gotten confirmation that the probe's harpoons deployed — let alone that they stuck. The Rosetta team is concerned that the probe might roll out of place, but they're considering re-firing the harpoons to try again.  If the surface is too soft, it's possible that the probe won't be able to anchor itself at all — which would make it hard to stay upright. And if the team refires the harpoons, it's possible that the probe will actually just get knocked into a bad position.
If Philae flips over, it has no way to right itself.
But even if the morning ends with disappointment, Rosetta has been — and will continue to be — a resounding success, researchers say.
Open University space scientists, who have spent 20 years researching and developing tools for the Rosetta mission, await its landing on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko on Nov. 12, 2014. In this video, the team describes how Rosetta came together, how it will land and what it has learned. (The Open University)
"The lander would be the icing on the cake," Altwegg said. "But we've been receiving data on the atmosphere of the comet since August."
Alexander agreed. "Even during the descent itself, we'll be taking readings that will move our understanding of the comet forward leaps and bounds," she said.
And no matter what, Rosetta will continue to trail the targeted comet as it orbits the sun this year, no doubt giving scientists unprecedented insight into its composition.
But whether or not Philae lives up to its full potential as a scientific instrument, it has landed on a moving comet and shown us that humanity is capable of incredible things.

Company wants to leverage use of sensors to help augment driving
Bangalore, November 12:  
As Mercedes Benz looks to roll out its future line of luxury cars, it is looking at technology as one of the key differentiators.
Future concept
If you are driving a car and you get a phone call, Mercedes is looking at ways with which the call can be taken without using a cellphone but through a sensor-powered device that would come pre-installed in the vehicle.
“The way technology is coming into cars is changing the very concept of what a car will be in the future,” Helmut Schutt, Chief Information Officer Daimler, Trucks, Buses & Vans, told BusinessLine at CeBIT India conference. Companies such as Mercedes and others are redefining the way cars would be in the future — from the way sensors inside the car help in augmenting driving, entertainment devices can interact with car audio systems to the way cars can be maintained. “Using Big Data and other analytics technologies, we can do predictive maintenance to help a car owner decide when to change battery or engine oil,” said Schutt. Already, some bits of technology are present in Mercedes vehicles.
For example, if you have an iPhone, you need not take a call from the phone, instead can route it through a speaker, thereby helping in hands-free driving.
Also, the C-Class luxury sedans come with a new generation infotainment system called “Audio 20 Version 5.1”, with a new interface featuring a touchpad.
“We are working on such technologies on other platforms (such as Android and Microsoft),” added Schutt.
Recall issues
Despite these efforts a lot more needs to be done, opine industry watchers. This is especially in the backdrop of recent recalls due to problems in steering in its C-class cars in the US.
On the technology front, there are connectivity issues too. “User should be able to connect to 3G or other technologies and broadcast that same signal via Wi-Fi,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, Analyst at Greyhound Research.

From March  get single statement for MF  demat holdings  says SEBIFrom March, get single statement for MF, demat holdings, says SEBI
Our Bureau
Consolidation of account statement would be done on the basis of PAN. For accounts held by more than one person, the PAN of the first holder and pattern of holding would be considered.
Mumbai, November 12:  
Starting March 2015, investors will receive a consolidated account statement (CAS) for all their mutual fund investments and demat accounts.
This would be a unified record of transactions done during February 2015 and their holding in the accounts.
Budget announcement effect
This follows the Union Budget announcement to create one record for all financial assets of every individual. In a circular on Wednesday, SEBI directed depositories (NSDL and CDSL), asset management companies and mutual fund registrars (RTA-CAMS, Karvy) to put in place systems that would generate and dispatch single CAS to investors.
AMCs and RTAs have to share information with the depositories on a monthly basis to enable generation of CAS.
Consolidation of account statement would be done on the basis of permanent account number (PAN). For accounts held by more than one person, the PAN of the first holder and pattern of holding would be considered.
Matching PAN & CAS
AMCs/MF-RTAs and the depositories would match their PAN database to determine the common PANs for allocating the job of sending the CAS.
For PANs which are common between depositories and AMCs, depositories shall send the CAS. For cases such as PANs with no demat account and only MF units holding, the AMCs/ MF-RTAs shall continue to send the CAS to their unit holders as is being done presently.
For investors having multiple accounts across the two depositories, the depository having the demat account, which has been opened earlier, shall be the default depository for CAS.
However, depositories have to give demat account holders the option to receive the CAS or otherwise; option to receive by email or in physical form and option to choose the depository through which they wish to receive the CAS.
The CAS has to be dispatched to investors within 10 days from the month-end. Accounts with no transactions during the month will receive CAS once in six months.

Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews wants to move ... perhaps to Lincoln Park
Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews has placed his three-bedroom Lakeshore East condominium unit on the market for $2.25 million and is said to be on the hunt for larger home.
Blackhawks fans shouldn't worry about his future with the team. Given the eight-year, $84 million contract extension he signed in July, he's most likely trading up to a larger, more expensive place. According to real estate sources, Toews recently has been looking at single-family homes in Lincoln Park with his real estate agent, Jennifer Ames.
Ames could not be reached for comment.
The family of the late movie director John Hughes announced Monday that it is donating one of the family's two mansions in east Lake Forest to Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital as part of a fundraising campaign for a new hospital. ( Bob Goldsborough )
On Wednesday, Toews, 26, listed his 39th-floor unit in Lakeshore East, which has 21/2 baths, large terraces, high ceilings, two balconies, hardwood floors, an upgraded eat-in kitchen and a master suite with a walk-in closet. He paid $2.05 million for it in mid-2012. And he previously owned a 32nd-floor unit in a building farther east in Lakeshore East, which he sold in August 2013 for $1.63 million.
Frank Thomas' house for sale: The 41-room, 25,000-square-foot, contemporary-style mansion in Oak Brook that Chicago White Sox Hall of Famer Frank Thomas built in the 1990s and sold in 2003 came on the market last Friday for $2,499,900.
While Thomas holds several Sox batting records, he also entered the local real estate record books in 2003 when he sold the nine-bedroom mansion to real estate developer Ronald Scarlato for $7.95 million, the highest price ever paid in DuPage County for a residence.
In 2012, Scarlato's lender, Bank of America, filed a foreclosure lawsuit, and a DuPage judge issued a foreclosure judgment earlier this year and ordered a sale. The bank was the lone bidder at a sheriff's sale, paying the $3,038,750 opening bid for the mansion and its 3.3-acre parcel.

Although Bank of America subsequently tried to auction off the estate, some of Scarlato's personal property remained in the home, so potential bidders were not permitted to evaluate the mansion before bidding. As a result, no bids met the auction's reserve price.
Now, the bank has decided to list the now-empty mansion on the open market, said listing agent Bert Gor of Re/Max. Features include 8 1/2 baths, a dramatic two-story grand rotunda entry with two staircases and a 22-foot ceiling, a home theater dubbed "Hurtland Theaters" after Thomas' "The Big Hurt" nickname, an exercise room, disco and pool. The mansion has 16,857 square feet above grade, with another 8,500 square feet or so of space in the basement, Gor said.
"In the 1990s, this house was the 'smart house,' with the highest technology available at the time. There are all high-efficiency furnaces," Gor said. "And the fitness equipment dates to when Frank Thomas owned the house."
Thomas paid a reported $8.1 million to build the mansion, and first listed it in 2000 for $11 million. He currently has homes in Libertyville and outside Las Vegas.
Movie director's mansion donated: The family of the late movie director John Hughes announced Monday that it is donating one of the family's two mansions in east Lake Forest to Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital as part of a fundraising campaign for a new hospital.
The move comes as the seven-bedroom, 11,233-square-foot mansion on Westminster Avenue had languished on the market for the past three years. Hughes and his wife, Nancy, had long owned and occupied the Westminster Avenue mansion, built in 1930.
Hughes wrote, produced and directed movies set and filmed in the northern suburbs such as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," "The Breakfast Club," "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and "Home Alone." Hughes died in August 2009 at age 59 of a heart attack in New York.
Several months after Hughes' death, Nancy Hughes paid $5.2 million for a 17-room, 6,700-square-foot mansion about a block from Lake Michigan. In 2011 she placed the Westminster Avenue mansion on the market for $5.89 million. In early 2013, she cut her asking price to $4.995 million and reduced it again to $4.295 million in February.
On Oct. 1, Nancy Hughes took the Westminster Avenue mansion off the market.
On Monday Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital announced that the donation of the Westminster Avenue mansion and its 2.1-acre property will "help in the development of (a) new replacement hospital, which, to date, is the largest economic development project in Lake Forest history."
"John loved the beauty of Lake Forest; I love Lake Forest," Nancy Hughes said in the release. "So when the opportunity to help advance the hospital was presented, it was an easy decision to make."

CVS s Cigarette Ban Appears To Be Paying OffCVS's Cigarette Ban Appears To Have Boosted Sales
Posted:
reddit
CVS's move to ban cigarette sales earlier this year seems to be paying off.
Revenue jumped 9.7 percent in CVS' latest quarter from the same period a year ago, the company, which has rebranded itself as CVS Health, reported on Tuesday. That was due in part to a nearly 16-percent gain in revenue for CVS's pharmacy services, which rose to $22.5 billion in the quarter from $19.4 billion a year earlier.
The gain in pharmacy-services revenue helped offset a 4.5-percent year-over-year drop in sales in what is known as the "front of the store" -- where things like magazines, candy, greeting cards and toothpaste are sold -- in stores open a year or more.  And that drop was due to the end of cigarette sales, CVS said.
This all fits into CVS’s grand strategy to rebrand itself as a more healthful company, said Vishnu Lekraj, an analyst who covers CVS for the investment research firm Morningstar.
CVS's pharmacy services trade, where the 16-percent increase in revenue occurred, is where the company earns big bucks by contracting with large employers and insurance companies to administer prescription-drug coverage. And it can better attract corporate partners with a healthier brand, Lekraj said.
"They can’t market themselves as a health-care servicer when they’re selling one of the most unhealthy products around,” he said.
Front-of-store sales at CVS will keep falling in the near term, but that doesn't really matter, Lekraj said. The money that CVS can earn by grabbing a larger portion of the country's expanding health-care market will likely outweigh the annual $2 billion it loses through cigarette sales , which only made up a small percentage of its revenue in the first place.
Health-care spending in the U.S. is projected to grow by 5.6 percent this year and by another 6 percent a year from 2015-2023 , according to predictions by federal auditors. There are millions of people newly insured by the Affordable Care Act . And CVS is also turning itself into a low-budget doctor's office: The company has more than 900 "Minute Clinics" nationwide that offer quick service for things like flu shots or blood-pressure tests, luring in customers who may not want to wait (or travel) to see a doctor.

Avoiding common mistakes that board members make0
Not raising assessments. Even though the cost of nearly everything goes up, some boards are adamant about keeping assessments at the same level year after year.
"People say, 'My salary isn't going up, so we can't raise assessments,' and they feel very strongly about that," said Marcia Caruso, president at Caruso Management Group in Naperville. "How much money somebody earns is not the answer to how much the assessments should be. Assessments have to be whatever it takes to maintain the property and keep up the level of service the association wants to have."
"The board of directors has a fiduciary obligation to maintain the common elements," said Salvatore Sciacca, president of Chicago Property Services in Chicago. "In addition, the association should maintain healthy reserves in order to proactively address future capital repair and replacement projects."
Skimping on professional help. Boards sometimes resist hiring project managers or engineers to oversee their capital projects or asking their attorney to review contracts and issue opinions.
"They want to do things inexpensively, and it ends up costing twice as much," Caruso said.
Bidding out the management contract is a good idea, but automatically hiring the least expensive bidder can be a mistake, Sciacca said.
"The management fee is only one consideration," he said. "What matters more is the overall benefit that is being provided. A highly skilled management company that specializes in condo associations pays for itself in money savings and avoided stress and aggravation."
Association attorney Charles VanderVennet, of Arlington Heights, suggested inviting your attorney to a meeting to discuss a particular topic in detail as well as any tangential issues at once. You'll save money over paying the attorney to answer every question by letter or email.
"If boards secure professional opinions, they are more likely to make the right decisions because they are making informed decisions," Caruso said.
Being reactive rather than proactive. Preventing a problem is generally less expensive than paying for a solution, VanderVennet said.
"Keeping ahead of a situation, anticipating what might go wrong and taking direct, pre-emptive action can keep the problem from worsening or happening at all," he said.
Allowing meetings to drag on. The danger is that important decisions are rushed late at night when everyone is tired and wants to get home. Follow an agenda and limit homeowner discussion, Lutz said.
"Owners attend as observers, not participants," he said.
Disregard for the complaints or suggestions of owners. Especially the noisy, unlikeable ones, Lutz said.
"Underneath the ranting and raving is often a valid complaint or a great idea," he said. "You just have to listen past the distraction."

India-based Neutrino Observatory project awaits PMO approvalmicro science
India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project – a study to understand the properties of atmospheric neutrinos through an underground lab - in Theni district is awaiting a final nod from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
“We have done all the pre-approval work such as fencing, constructing basic necessary buildings at Madurai. But the first step towards the main project needs PMO approval and that’s what we have been waiting for,” Naba K. Mondal, chief of INO project told PTI.
Christened ‘India-based Neutrino Observatory’ by the Department of Atomic Energy, the project will study atmospheric neutrinos some 1,300 metres below ground near Pottipuram village of Theni district and is expected to provide precise measurement of neutrino mixing parameters. INO was initially allotted Rs. 83 crore to start various pre-project activities at the site.
The proposed INO comprises of two underground laboratory caverns with a rock cover of more than 1000 metres all around to house detectors and control equipment, for which a two kilometre access tunnel would be driven under a mountain, according to the INO website.
More than 30 research institutions across India like Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Harish Chandra Research Institute are coordinating with INO for the project.

Obama Urges FCC To Protect Net NeutralityObama Urges FCC To Set 'Strongest Possible Rules' To Protect Net Neutrality
Posted:

On Monday, President Barack Obama came out in favor of the "strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality," endorsing a popular proposal that would empower the Federal Communications Commission to require Internet service providers to treat all web traffic equally and not charge content providers for better access.
"We cannot allow Internet service providers to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas," Obama said in a statement .
The FCC is currently weighing whether ISPs, such as Verizon and Comcast, can choose to block or prioritize delivering traffic to certain websites. The consideration comes in the wake of a federal appeals court ruling in January that struck down the rules that barred companies from doing so. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FCC was considering a "hybrid" compromise that would empower ISPs to make deals with companies to allow for faster content delivery, while still allowing for oversight.
Obama's plan provides for more regulation than that. He's backing a proposal that would reclassify ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, treating the service as a public utility. Under that section , it's illegal "to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services."
Obama is also asking for a ban on paid prioritization, a practice that allows companies to put service in the "slow lane" if a content provider doesn't pay a fee.
"If a consumer requests access to a website or service, and the content is legal, your ISP should not be permitted to block it," Obama's statement said. "Nor should ISPs be able to intentionally slow down some content or speed up others ... based on the type of service or your ISP's preferences."
Obama's plan won't be popular with telecom companies, but it has wide support from the U.S. public, which submitted to the FCC almost 4 million comments overwhelmingly in favor of net neutrality this summer. Whether FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will adopt Obama's plan remains in question.
On Monday morning, a group of protesters showed up at Wheeler's house to advocate for net neutrality. They wielded a banner reading, "Save the Internet," which Wheeler initially helped them hold.
"This is not a photo-op for you to pretend like you're saving the Internet," one protester said.
Wheeler reiterated, "I have long stated, everything is on the table."

'You have to be brutally honest with yourself and understand your strengths and weaknesses.'
When actress Jessica Alba first conceived her idea to launch a line of nontoxic household and baby products in 2008, skeptics tried to push her toward the same tried and true starlet formula: Why not just be the face of a new perfume? A few years later, she has a pretty good answer.  The Honest Company  is expected to pull in more than $150 million in revenue in 2014, has a reported $1 billion valuation, and is poised to go public. Take that, Hollywood.

I founded The Honest Company on this idea: Everything that touches you and your family — everything in your home — needs to be nontoxic, needs to be effective and beautiful to look at, and needs to be affordable. I really wanted it to have an  e-commerce  model. What are the things that all parents need? Diapers and wipes, for sure. And then a mix of cleaning and personal care products. Wouldn't it be great if you could pick five things and get them delivered through a  monthly subscription ?

Everyone I approached was skeptical. There wasn't one person who said, “Yeah, that can happen.” I heard “Just do one thing really well and then you can expand” a lot. But I wanted this to be a whole lifestyle brand. Everyone I talked with in Hollywood could not wrap their heads around the idea. Whenever I tried to sit down with them about it, they would just get this glazed look on their faces. Entertainment is a totally different business. It's like, how do you squeeze the most out of a person for five seconds, and then you move on to the next one. It's hard for people to take anyone seriously who's never done this before. They see you only as something else. But all that just gave me fire to move forward.
I approached this guy who built the top-selling accessories brand at Macy's. We're friends, and he was trying to help me figure out how to execute on this idea. But he built his brand off of one item and then expanded. He found traditional retail partners and then opened his own stores. He didn't understand how to build this thing from scratch. Friends want to help you, but they're also going to be the most critical. We launched with 17 products. Even my husband, Cash, thought the idea was too big.
It took me three years to find my  business partners . You have to be brutally honest with yourself and understand your strengths and weaknesses. I'm not a business person — I'm a mom. I wasn't going to be coding. I wasn't going to be in the lab mixing potions. (Though I do test all the products on my kids!) I wasn't going to be the one doing the business model and running the operation. If I went in there and said, “Hey, I'm going to put together this business from scratch all by myself,” I'm sure it would have been a lot more difficult to get VCs to take me seriously, but once you have the right partners, it isn't. Having the right partners also means having people you like. They're all people I wouldn't mind getting stuck with at an airport for five hours. We can hang and have a beer and chat it up, or stay silent together and be totally cool with that. That's really important.
Then the team sat down with a lot of people who weren't going to invest — friends like Tory Burch and Narciso Rodriguez, both of whom built successful businesses, and people from big tech companies and public companies — to test our pitch. They asked us great questions: What are you going to do when you run out of product? What if it's not delivered on time? How are you going to get people to your website?
With them, it didn't matter that we weren't perfect in the way we pitched Honest. It was kind of like how comedians go out and do standup in small clubs in different cities to test their material before they do their HBO special: All of that back-and-forth helped us refine our  pitch . And it got a lot shorter — we got it down to a 10-minute pitch deck and a 15-minute question-and-answer session. So then we knew we could do it in a 30-minute meeting.
Almost every VC we talked to was on their first or second child and told me their wives were doing the same research that I was, trying to find a brand they could trust. We didn't try to find investors with young families. It just happened. But in retrospect, that would have been a good tactic!
By the time we got into the room with VCs, it wasn't that hard of a sell. We went in with a real plan of attack, a strong process, and smart people. By that point we had talked to so many people, having them try to poke holes in the idea. Because that is exactly what the VCs are going to do. Inevitably, they're going to ask questions you can't answer. If you're writing down the 20th question to which you don't have an answer, that's a problem. You can say “I'll get back to you,” but not more than five times.
Inside the Honest formula
The Honest Company — which Jessica Alba co-founded in 2011 with CEO Brian Lee, COO Sean Kane, and chief product officer Christopher Gavigan — pitches its products as the solution to many a parent's woes: They're nontoxic, they actually work, and they look nice on the counter. Many doubted the company could succeed, but it's rung up impressive numbers in a few short years. Revenues in 2014 are projected to hit $150 million, and Honest has scored $122 million in funding, including a $70 million round in August that valued the company at nearly $1 billion. How did Alba and the Honest team manage to come so far so quickly?
Recurring revenue
Nearly 80 percent of Honest Company's sales come from its subscription plans, which let customers bundle items and have them delivered monthly. Those subscribers pay up front, giving the business more cash flow and providing predictable, repeating revenue — and such businesses are valued at higher multiples.
The upsell
Honest's biggest seller is diapers: The company ships more than 10,000 product orders daily, and half include its fashionably patterned, plant-based diapers. To promote its cleaning and personal care products, Honest offers free trials (customers pay $6 for shipping). And it works. Half of Honest's trial users wind up buying more products.
The feel-good halo
Like startups Toms and Warby Parker, the Honest Company built a charitable mission into its business model. With every customer purchase, the company promises to do some good work--such as donating baby supplies to local diaper banks and sending employees to volunteer for L.A.-area beach cleanup days.

Obamacare Enrollment Goal Lower Than ExpectedObamacare Enrollment Goal For 2015 Is 9 Million, Lower Than Expected
Posted:
Updated:

Enrollment for next year's health insurance plans via the Obamacare exchanges begins Nov. 15 and ends Feb. 15. Consumers can preview prices and subsidy amounts this week. | Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
reddit
Just days ahead of the next Obamacare sign-up period, the Department of Health and Human Services is scaling back projections of how many people will be enrolled by the end of next year.
An analysis released by HHS on Monday projects between 9 million and 9.9 million individuals will be enrolled in health insurance plans obtained via an Affordable Care Act exchange by the end of 2015. That's up to 4 million fewer people than estimated by the Congressional Budget Office in April. HHS also reported that 7.1 million people were fully enrolled as of Oct. 15, a decline of about 200,000 from August .
Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said the department's target for 2015 is on the lower end of the range outlined in the report. "The number that we are going to aim for is 9.1 million," she said during an event at the Center for American Progress in Washington. "Probably the market will grow between 25 and 30 percent."
On net, the projection amounts to just 2 million additional customers in private health insurance obtained through an Obamacare exchange by the end of 2015, compared to this year.
After a rocky start in October of last year, the first Obamacare sign-up period resulted in 8 million people choosing health plans from an exchange marketplace, including those who have since given up that coverage. Surveys show the number of uninsured Americans declined by 10.3 million this year as a result of exchange enrollment, new Medicaid beneficiaries and people gaining coverage through other means.
HHS officials, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity Monday, attributed the reduced projection for 2015 Obamacare enrollment mainly to the expectation that fewer consumers than previously estimated would move away from job-based insurance or private plans purchased outside the exchanges from insurers or brokers.
"We think that the evidence points to a longer ramp-up rate than the CBO projections had, and that is based on what we've learned over the last year from looking at our own data and from examining the experiences of other, similar types of programs," one HHS official said. The CBO had predicted 24 million consumers would be purchasing private insurance on an exchange by the end of 2016. HHS maintains exchange enrollment still will rise to the 25 million CBO projected for 2017 and future years, but that it may take until 2019 instead.
Burwell outlined the new challenges facing Obamacare enrollment, emphasizing that the coming sign-up period will be the first time the exchanges handle new customers and existing policyholders seeking to renew, and that it will last half as long as the six-month enrollment phase that began last October. In addition, the next wave of uninsured people who gain coverage may be smaller because the people who were easiest to find already signed up . "The next group of people will be harder to reach," Burwell said.
Still, the majority of new Obamacare customers next year will come from the ranks of the currently uninsured, the department's report concludes. "HHS’s analysis implies that most of the new marketplace enrollment for 2015 is likely to come from the ranks of the uninsured, with approximately three or four previously uninsured new enrollees for each new enrollee drawn from the ranks of those who previously had off-marketplace individual coverage," the report says.
HHS estimates that the population potentially eligible to use a health insurance exchange to buy private coverage is 23 million to 27 million people, including 15 million uninsured who qualify for subsidized private coverage and 8 million to 12 million who now buy plans directly from an insurer or through an agent or broker. Subsidies are only available via an exchange, and 85 percent of this year's enrollees received the financial assistance.
Federal officials think that 83 percent of the 7.1 million currently covered by insurance purchased on an exchange, or 5.9 million individuals, will still be covered by insurance purchased on an exchange by the end of next year, based on information from surveys, state-run exchanges and one unnamed insurance company, which show a range of 70 percent to 90 percent retain this type of insurance over the course of a year.
For the three-month 2015 enrollment period, HHS expects that 10.3 million to 11.7 million people will select an insurance plan on an exchange and that 9 million to 9.9 million will still have this coverage at the end of the year.
One HHS official stressed that the department does not believe that many of the individuals giving up exchange insurance plans this year or next are becoming uninsured. Officials did not provide estimates of how many have become insured or how many have switched to another form of health coverage. Surveys by Gallup and others show the uninsured rate is lower this year than in 2013.
"A number of things happen in that population. Some folks are getting jobs, so they go into their employers' insurance. Some folks may be eligible for Medicaid. There's a natural churn to a population in a marketplace, and so this type of retention number is not unexpected," the official said.
The decline in enrollments from August to October was largely the result of 112,000 households, representing an undisclosed number of people, losing coverage because they failed to provide up-to-date information about their incomes or their citizenship and immigration status, officials said.
The open enrollment period for private health insurance available to individuals who do not receive coverage through an employer or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid begins Saturday, Nov. 15, and runs through Feb. 15.

My Job Sucks (and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves)reddit
Most adults spend the majority of our time at work. The joy or stress we get from our jobs directly impacts our happiness, health, relationships, financial success and overall satisfaction with life. In fact, 80% of adults say their job is the most stressful thing in their lives - but it is how we respond to that stress that determines if it will hurt our happiness.
Because we spend so many hours working, it's easy to blame our boss, the company or our job tasks for anything negative that happens in our lives. Any of these sound familiar?
Money is tight. Bleepin' company won't give me a raise.
I'm stressed out. My boss is such a jerk.
I'm overweight because I'm stuck sitting at my desk all day.
I can't quit smoking - all my co-workers go out for smoke breaks.
I don't get along with my spouse. I'm always crabby from work.
I don't see my kids enough. I have to work such long hours to get the job done.
And the list goes on!
It's easy to blame our jobs when we spend so much time there. But it is not your company's fault. It isn't your boss's fault. It's not up to them to hold your hand and help you be proactive about your life and goals. Sure - they need to provide a paycheck, a positive workplace culture and support to help you grow and develop. But it's up to YOU to use those resources and take action on creating a job and life that fits your needs.
How can you shift your perspective and attitude when it really seems like a bad job or bad boss is to blame for your troubles?
Rewind. Go back to the beginning of your relationship with your company. Why did you pursue a job there in the first place? What made you want to work there?  Try to reconnect with your original motivation for working at your company to get re-inspired in your work.
List it. Write down all the perks, benefits, bonuses and positive things your company does. These can be tangible things like "paycheck" or "free lunch" or they can be intangible like "helps the community" or "makes a great product." Once you've listed all the things your company offers, circle the ones you have used or taken advantage of in the past. Chances are there are many things your company offers that you aren't fully utilizing. (Think gym discounts, flexible work hours, vacation time, social events, etc.)
Fire up. Are you a lazy or unmotivated employee? Do you do the bare minimum just to collect a paycheck? Do you put little effort into your appearance and energy levels when you come into the office? Kick yourself in the pants and bring your best self to work. When you are low-energy, lazy or unpolished, people perceive you negatively which impacts how successful you are personally and professionally. Take responsibility for your actions and behaviors by doing and giving your best at work and at home.
Get real. When you take a long, hard, honest look at your life, is it your job that is causing you problems or are things happening at home that are impacting work? If it really is work, are you guilty of bringing your work drama home with you and bringing your loved ones down with you? Be honest with yourself about what is really driving your issues and contain it. Don't let it overflow into other areas of your life and start a viscous cycle of stress.
Change it. If you are truly unhappy with your work situation why are you staying in it? Talk to your boss or HR about your tasks, people issues, goals and skills. Are they in line with what you're good at and where you want to go in your career? If not, work with them on shifting your job responsibilities. If you are still unhappy despite trying the tips above and working on your own mindset, it's time to leave the company and find somewhere you can be happy and thrive. Stop the complaining, take action and create your own life how you envision it.
Most people are so busy being busy that they forget to stop and enjoy their work and life. When you take a breath to identify why your job is causing you stress and then take another breath to figure out a solution, you are one step closer to happiness.

NEW YORK (AP) — Alibaba's sales in China totaled $9.34 billion on Singles Day, a day dedicated to the uncommitted, the Chinese e-commerce powerhouse said Tuesday.
During the anti-Valentine's Day that takes place every Nov. 11 in China, singles buy presents for themselves. The holiday is being more closely watched since Alibaba went public in September. The company owns trademarks on the name of the holiday and protects its use zealously.
The big sales day in China comes just as the U.S. shopping season heads into high gear.
The National Retail Federation projected Tuesday that sales in November and December will rise 4.1 percent to $616.9 billion, up a percentage point from last year. That would mark the greatest increase since 2011, when sales rose 4.8 percent.
Online spending on Black Friday, the hectic shopping day after Thanksgiving, totaled $1.2 billion in 2013. On Cyber Monday, the top online spending day, sales totaled $1.84 billion, according to research firm comScore.
Tuesday on CNBC, in addition to revealing the sales for Singles Day, Alibaba CEO Jack Ma also said the company may consider taking Alipay public. The electronic payment service is Alibaba's answer to PayPal and Apple Pay. Ma did not provide a timeframe.
At a tech industry conference in October, Ma said that the company could partner with Apple.
Shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. fell $4.17, or 3.5 percent, to $114.98 in midday trading.

China will launch about 120 satellites to meet the country’s requirements in communication, space infrastructure and navigation sectors.
“We will focus on building a self-controlled national space infrastructure that can operate continuously and stably for a long time,” said Yang Baohua, deputy general manager of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation on Monday.
However, Yang did not specify the period of time over which the launches will span.
The Communist nation will launch about 70 remote sensing satellites to detect the near-earth space environment and predict extreme events, beside about 20 communication satellites to meet communication demand in national security and public services.
In addition, China will launch about 30 navigation satellites to provide accurate and reliable global positioning and navigation services, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
The Chinese economy will continue to record relatively high growth, generating more demand for aerospace technologies, Yang said at an international aviation and aerospace forum held in south China’s Zhuhai city.

Linda Rottenburg: The Living Proof That Risk Carries Rewardreddit
It was while in a taxi cab in Argentina that Linda Rottenberg was confronted with the fact that while the entrepreneurial spirit is something to be celebrated in the United States, this is not the case in many places across the globe. In fact, her driver, who held a degree in engineering was not even familiar with the word "entrepreneur." When Linda cofounded Endeavor in 1997, it was to help people like this; people with the skills and expertise but without understanding of how to create a business.
Endeavor is a non-profit organization the focuses on fostering high impact entrepreneurs globally. Linda helps focus budding entrepreneurs on a path that allows them to grow their business, grow the economy and then in turn, support the next generation of entrepreneurs. This was unheard of twenty years ago. "If you can't imagine it, you can't become it," Linda explained to Deepak Chopra in an episode of NEWSWIRE.FM 's program ONE WORLD .
"We started out thinking that we would only be needed in emerging markets," Linda recalls. But what started as a small project in Latin America quickly grew as Endeavor started getting calls from entrepreneurs in the Middle East, Europe and in countries across the globe. "When economies turn down, that's when entrepreneurs look up" and with the global economic crisis, Endeavor was able to fill the void and help small businesses begin creating jobs and spurring economic growth.
Linda's new book "Crazy is a Compliment: The Power of Zigging When Everyone Else Zags" chronicles many of the experiences that have made Linda so successful. Linda explains that "the secret has been learning not to expect it to be easy, chaos is your friend, failure is ok, and distress is opportunity." Linda is living proof that risk carries reward and that even when a door is closed in your face, there is still so much opportunity for success.

Police unable to identify Union minister Nihal Chand s address to deliver summonsPrint
Written by Sweta Dutta | Jaipur | Posted: November 12, 2014 8:56 pm
The alleged rape of a 20-year-old woman involving Union Minister Nihal Chand Meghwal is stuck in ‘identification of residences’ with the police unable to identify the ‘correct addresses’ of the accused to deliver the court summons. Meghwal and six others out of the total 17 accused in the case appeared through their lawyers before a lower court on Wednesday citing suo moto cognizance of the court hearing through media reports. They told the court that no summons was served on them.
The court was told by the local police that the exact residential addresses of five accused named in the revision petition have not been mentioned by the victim, hence they could not be traced. The Vaishali Nagar police station cited ‘work pressure’ for not being able to look for the prime accused Om Prakash Godara, the alleged victim’s husband. Former MLA Yogeshwar Garg also could not be found at the given rented accommodation while his son Prakash Punj Garg, also named in the case, appeared through a lawyer.
The court in its previous hearing on August 20 had asked Ganganagar Superintendent of Police to find Union Minister Meghwal and ensure that the summons is delivered to him, be it in Ganganagar or New Delhi. As Meghwal’s lawyer, AK Jain, appeared in court, he maintained that the summons was not served on him but he had taken suo moto cognizance of the case hearing and appeared on behalf of Meghwal. The SP did not appear for the hearing or send any representative to explain why the summons could not be delivered.
Since all the accused or their representatives could not appear for the hearing on Wednesday, the court was adjourned for next hearing on December 6.
“As responsible citizens we have taken suo moto cognizance of the court hearing and appeared. The summons was not delivered to Meghwal. It is a fabricated case. In February this year, the magistrate court had dismissed the case as false and baseless. It is a revision petition. The alleged victim should have furnished the residential and other identification details of the accused, which she has been unable to do so far,” AK Jain told the Indian Express.
Chandu Ram Yadav, the victim’s lawyer, said, “It is not the victim’s job to locate the accused. The police should do it. These names were mentioned right from the beginning of the case. The police has done nothing in the case so far. How can the victim be expected to look up each of the accused and where they live currently?”

JPMorgan Chase, Citibank among 6 firms hit with fines for attempts to manipulate foreign exchange market
In another black eye for the financial industry, U.S., British and Swiss regulators on Wednesday fined JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America Corp. and three other global banks a total of about $4.3 billion to settle investigations into attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates.
The fines, including the largest ever issued by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, are the latest multibillion-dollar hit to the industry in the wake of alleged misconduct in the 2008 financial crisis and attempts to rig major international markets.
“The setting of a benchmark rate is not simply another opportunity for banks to earn a profit," said Aitan Goelman, director of enforcement at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

"Countless individuals and companies around the world rely on these rates to settle financial contracts, and this reliance is premised on faith in the fundamental integrity of these benchmarks," he said.
"The market only works if people have confidence that the process of setting these benchmarks is fair, not corrupted by manipulation by some of the biggest banks in the world," Goelman said.
The CFTC settlement included a total of $1.48 billion in fines: $310 million each for JPMorgan Chase Bank and Citibank; $290 million each for the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS; and $275 million for HSBC Bank.

9:19 a.m.: An earlier version of this post said the CFTC fined JPMorgan Chase Bank and Citibank $310 billion each. They were fined $310 million each.
------------
British regulators hit the five firms with a combined $1.7 billion in fines, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority levied a $138-million fine against UBS.
Several hours after those fines were announced, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it fined JPMorgan and Citibank $350 million each and also fined Bank of America $250 million for "unsafe or unsound practices" related to their foreign exchange businesses.
The settlements end investigation into attempted manipulation of benchmark foreign exchange rates to benefit the positions of traders at the banks, regulators said.
Citigroup said Wednesday it had “acted quickly upon becoming aware of issues in our foreign exchange business" and has changed its systems and monitoring "to better guard against improper behavior."
Barclays, another global bank under investigation in the foreign exchange probe, declined to take part in the settlement. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said it was continuing to investigate the bank.
About $5.3 trillion changes hands each day in the foreign exchange market, one of the world's largest, with about 40% of the trades taking place in London, the agency said.
From Jan. 1, 2008, until Oct. 15, 2013, "ineffective controls at the banks" allowed their traders to put the firms' financial interests ahead of clients' in the market, the Financial Conduct Authority said.

The traders shared confidential information about clients' activities and colluded with traders at other banks to manipulate foreign exchange rates.
"Traders at different banks formed tightknit groups in which information was shared about client activity, including using code names to identify clients without naming them," the FCA said. These groups were described as, for example, "'the players," “the 3 musketeers,” “1 team, 1 dream,” “a co-operative” and “the A-team," the agency said.
Some of the manipulation occurred at the same time regulators were investigating possible manipulation of another benchmark, the London interbank offered rate, also known as Libor, which helps set interest rates around the world.
“Firms could have been in no doubt, especially after Libor, that failing to take steps to tackle the consequences of a free-for-all culture on their trading floors was unacceptable," said Tracey McDermott, the Financial Conduct Authority's director of enforcement and financial crime.
"If they fail to do so, they will continue to face significant regulatory and reputational costs,” she said.
With the latest action, the CFTC said it has fined banks more than $3.34 billion since 2012 for attempted manipulation of global financial benchmarks.
London-based Barclays said Wednesday it had “engaged constructively” with regulators, including the FCA and the CFTC, and had “considered a settlement on closely similar terms to those announced the morning."
"However, after discussions with other regulators and authorities, we have concluded that it is in the interests of the company to seek a more general coordinated settlement,” the bank said.
A person familiar with the matter said Barclays was holding out because it could not reach agreement with New York’s Department of Financial Services, headed by Benjamin Lawsky, who had set tougher conditions for a settlement, including a demand to install monitors within the bank.
The New York regulator, which has jurisdiction over foreign banks charted in New York State, is probing a dozen banks in its foreign exchange probe, including Deutsche Bank.

Controversial LBT to be scrapped  Maharashtra Governor announcesNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Maharashtra government is going to scrap the controversial Local Body Tax (LBT), Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao today told the state legislature here.
“The Local Body Tax will be cancelled after making alternative arrangement shortly,” he said in his address to the House after the BJP government won the trust vote.
LBT was supposed to replace the octroi, however the trader community is opposed to it on the ground that it is complicated and involves a lot of paperwork.
The government will issue a white paper on the financial position of the state, liabilities, future plans and necessary measures for more transparent, effective expenditure, he said.
The government will felicitate the brave children who save others’ lives by risking their own by constituting an award in the name of the late police constable Tukaram Ombale (‘Hutatma Tukaram Ombale Balveer Award’), he said.
Special women’s squads would be created and deployed for the safety of women in the public places, adequate women police officers would be recruited; mobile phone technology will be used to prevent the violence against women, he said.
The government will make serious efforts to improve the low conviction rate, especially in the cases related to atrocities against scheduled castes and tribes, he added.
“My government shall enable the police to take recourse to best private legal support to achieve higher conviction rate. Witness protection programme shall be encouraged,” he said.
Saying that the state required huge investments for completing several ongoing projects in irrigation, transportation and basic infrastructure, the Governor added that there was a need to reorient public expenditure, eliminate revenue deficit and make more resources available for investment in capital assets.
“My government will devise a special strategy to control unnecessary expenditure, plug financial leakages, improve investment climate and reduce corruption. The government will launch a time-bound plan for speedy implementation of various pending projects with special emphasis on addressing the regional disparity in the state,” he said.

Maharashtra: Speaker suspends five Congress MLAs for two years for heckling GovernorMaharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao addresses the joint session of State Assembly in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Source: PTI Photo)
Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:18 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 8:28 am
Five Congress legislators were on Wednesday suspended by Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagde for two years for allegedly heckling and physically stopping Governor C Vidyasagar Rao as he entered the Vidhan Bhawan today.
Revenue minister Eknath Khadse proposed their suspension saying that the Governor had received “injuries” on his left hand during the incident.
Congress MLAs who have been suspended are Jaykumar Gore, Rahul Bondre, Abdul Sattar, Amar Kale and Virendra Jagtap.
A House panel is set to probe the incident and submit its report during the winter session of the legislature.

World cannot afford European economic lost ...European Central Bank
(US urged European governments…)
WASHINGTON: The United States warned Wednesday that the global economy cannot endure a "European lost decade," criticizing "status quo policies" in the eurozone ahead of the G20 summit this week.
Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a speech that monetary easing by the European Central Bank is not enough to avoid a deeper slump across Europe.
And he said that other countries should not rely on the US economy to prop up global growth.
"The world cannot afford a European lost decade," Lew said, according to the text of his speech at the World Affairs Council in Seattle.
"The ECB has taken forceful steps to support the economy through accommodative monetary policy."
"But as recent economic performance suggests, this alone has not proven sufficient to restore healthy growth. Resolute action by national authorities and other European bodies is needed to reduce the risk that the region could fall into a deeper slump."
Underscoring a growing worry that the global economy is turning downward, Lew added that other countries are relying too much on the United States to prop up global growth.
"The world fundamentally needs more demand," he said. "The global economy cannot prosper broadly relying on the United States to be the importer of first and last resort," he said.
"Nor can it rely on the United States to grow fast enough to make up for weak growth in major world economies."
"The world is stronger if we all take steps to bolster domestic demand."
Lew's comments came ahead of the annual meeting of leaders of the G20 group of economic powers in Brisbane, Australia this weekend.
Sluggish global growth and backsliding by the eurozone economy are expected to be key topics in the summit.
Lew emphasized the need for more fiscal efforts -- elevated government spending and other approaches -- in the United States and elsewhere to strengthen growth.
"By using fiscal space where available to make critical investments in people and infrastructure ... policymakers can put their respective economies on the right track and contribute to shared global prosperity."
Lew applauded Japan's combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus in its efforts to fire up growth after more than a decade of stagnation.
But he added that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe needs to follow through on the third thrust of its "three arrows" policy -- structural reforms -- to make sure that the gains from central bank stimulus and government spending are not lost.
"The test will be whether the third arrow is sufficient to transform Japan's economy, and the jury is still out," he said.
Lew held out the US recovery from the 2008-2009 Great Recession as an example for Washington's main G20 partners.
"Over the past four and a half years, the private sector has created more than ten and a half million new jobs, the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history," he said.
"In fact, we have created more jobs since the pre-crisis peak than Europe and Japan combined."
But he also said that the United States itself needs to do more to strengthen economic momentum, citing President Barack Obama's proposals for immigration and tax reforms, a higher minimum wage, and more spending on infrastructure.

Police unable to identify Union minister Nihal Chands address to deliver summonsPrint
Written by Sweta Dutta | Jaipur | Posted: November 12, 2014 8:56 pm
The alleged rape of a 20-year-old woman involving Union Minister Nihal Chand Meghwal is stuck in ‘identification of residences’ with the police unable to identify the ‘correct addresses’ of the accused to deliver the court summons. Meghwal and six others out of the total 17 accused in the case appeared through their lawyers before a lower court on Wednesday citing suo moto cognizance of the court hearing through media reports. They told the court that no summons was served on them.
The court was told by the local police that the exact residential addresses of five accused named in the revision petition have not been mentioned by the victim, hence they could not be traced. The Vaishali Nagar police station cited ‘work pressure’ for not being able to look for the prime accused Om Prakash Godara, the alleged victim’s husband. Former MLA Yogeshwar Garg also could not be found at the given rented accommodation while his son Prakash Punj Garg, also named in the case, appeared through a lawyer.
The court in its previous hearing on August 20 had asked Ganganagar Superintendent of Police to find Union Minister Meghwal and ensure that the summons is delivered to him, be it in Ganganagar or New Delhi. As Meghwal’s lawyer, AK Jain, appeared in court, he maintained that the summons was not served on him but he had taken suo moto cognizance of the case hearing and appeared on behalf of Meghwal. The SP did not appear for the hearing or send any representative to explain why the summons could not be delivered.
Since all the accused or their representatives could not appear for the hearing on Wednesday, the court was adjourned for next hearing on December 6.
“As responsible citizens we have taken suo moto cognizance of the court hearing and appeared. The summons was not delivered to Meghwal. It is a fabricated case. In February this year, the magistrate court had dismissed the case as false and baseless. It is a revision petition. The alleged victim should have furnished the residential and other identification details of the accused, which she has been unable to do so far,” AK Jain told the Indian Express.
Chandu Ram Yadav, the victim’s lawyer, said, “It is not the victim’s job to locate the accused. The police should do it. These names were mentioned right from the beginning of the case. The police has done nothing in the case so far. How can the victim be expected to look up each of the accused and where they live currently?”

Policing for profit in TennesseeBy Radley Balko November 12 Follow @radleybalko
Phil Williams of Nashville’s NewsChannel 5, WTVF-TV, one of the best TV investigative journalists in the country, has been doing particularly stellar work over the last several years on civil asset forfeiture in central Tennessee . He has continued that work with a series of reports this week.
A traffic stop along Interstate 40 is raising new questions about your constitutional rights. Among the questions: what happens to your right to say “no” to a search when police are looking for cash?
The traffic stop occurred west of Nashville, along a stretch of interstate in Dickson County that’s become well-known for a controversial practice known as “policing for profit.” . . .
[Ronnie] Hankins and his wife Lisa had been on the road for days back in May, after attending a family funeral in Virginia, when they got stopped on the westbound side of I-40. It came right after they passed an interdiction agent with the 23rd Judicial District Drug Task Force.
Lisa was driving.
“I told her we are going to get pulled over,” Ronnie remembered.
“What made you think he was going to stop you?” NewsChannel 5 Investigates asked.
“Because we had out-of-state license plates and my wife is Hispanic.”
I personally know people who can vouch for this. Out-of-state plates, dark skin and driving through a forfeiture corridor will dramatically raise your odds of getting stopped. And it’s everywhere, not just Tennessee.
After separating Lisa from her husband, supposedly so he could write her a warning ticket for a traffic violation, dashcam video shows that the agent began repeatedly questioning her about what was inside the car.
Then, he had a favor to ask.
“You say there’s not anything illegal in it. Do you mind if I search it today to make sure?” the officer asked.
Lisa responded, “I’d have to talk to my husband.”
She told NewsChannel 5 Investigates, “I just feel like he was harassing me, you know, wanting me to say yes that he can search my car.”
The agent continued, “I am asking you for permission to search your vehicle today — and you are well within your rights to say no and you can say yes. It’s totally up to you as to whether you want to show cooperation or not.”
So why not say yes?
“I mean there was no reason for him to search my car,” Lisa said.
The interdiction agent told her that he was asking “because I do believe that you are not being honest with me.”
The agent didn’t believe their story that they had been to a funeral for Ronnie’s grandfather, even though a quick search of the Internet would have proved they were telling the truth.
“You have to either give me a yes or no,” he continued. “I do need an answer so I can figure out whether I need a dog to go around it or not.”
Lisa recalled, “I was getting upset because he kept on asking me over and over. I said you have no reason to search my car.”
They brought out a drug dog, which of course “alerted” to the presence of drugs. So the couple was subjected to an extremely thorough roadside search of their belongings. They ripped out the dash of the car, which the couple had recently bought new.
The police found no contraband. Here’s the punchline:
 . . . when Ronnie insisted there were no drugs, the agent confided he wasn’t really expecting any.
“Well, I’ll be honest with you, with you going this direction, I wouldn’t think you’d have drugs in the car — you would have a large amount of money,” he said.
Williams’s previous investigations have shown that these drug task forces are far more likely to pull over motorists in the lane that’s leaving Nashville than the lane going into the city — for precisely the reason the officer gave to Hankins. If you pull over a car full of drugs, that’s of little value to a police department. But if you wait for the drugs to be sold, then pull over cars that meet your drug courier profile as they’re leaving a major city, they’re much more likely to be filled with cash. I’m not a supporter of the drug war, but if I were, I’d find that to be rather counterproductive.
And as it turns out, Hankins is a federal police officer in San Diego. Even that didn’t seem to prevent them from trampling on his and his wife’s Fourth Amendment rights. In their report, the police claimed to have found pot “debris” in the car, but not enough to charge the couple with a crime. This too is typical. It’s an attempt to make the stop, drug dog alert and all look legitimate. It also can’t be disproven. It’s an accusation that will never be tried in a court. Because of that, it’s also an insurance policy against bad publicity. People wrongly subjected to one of these stops who want to go public will now have their names publicly associated with a police report linking them to allegations of drug possession.
I’ve spoken to drug dog trainers who have told me that these dogs could be trained to not alert to “debris,” “shake,” “residue” and other immeasurable quantities of drugs. But the police departments don’t want them trained that way. They want them to alert to anything and everything, because they want to search any car that might turn up some cash for the police agency.
In a follow-up report , Williams showed the dash cam video of the alert to the Hankinses’ car to Dr. Lawrence Myers, a professor of veterinary medicine at Auburn University and a drug dog expert.
The first thing that Myers noticed is that there’s no microphone on the handler, raising all sorts of questions.
“Is the handler giving any audible cues to the dog or just simply saying sit?” he asked.
We followed up, “So in this case we don’t hear what he’s saying to the dog?”
“Not a clue,” he responded.
Myers also noted that the officer keeps his hands to himself on the passenger side, but — as he rounds the car — that suddenly changes.
“The officer pointed at the spot where the dog eventually sat before the dog sat,” Myers said. “That’s actually a cue.”
“Intentional?” we asked.
“I don’t think so.”
Myers said it could be a training issue.
“Dogs take their cues from people. ‘I must go investigate: what is he pointing at?’ Then having stopped and paused and the whole thing, the officer then releases tension on the leash. The dog goes, hmm, sit.”
In fact, the search did not turn up drugs or anything illegal.
Our investigation also uncovered another traffic stop where one interdiction agent from the 23rd led his dog around a vehicle three times without getting an alert.
Instead of accepting the result, he blamed the dog’s arthritis.
That’s when another officer brought out his dog. After two rounds, he got an alert — finally giving officers a reason to search.
That search too turned up no drugs. As I’ve written previously here at The Watch, drug dogs are notoriously unreliable, and often serve more to confirm the hunches of their handlers  — intentionally or not. (My favorite example: the police department that actually named its drug dog “Guilty.” ) And, of course, the entire reason we have a Fourth Amendment is to protect us from invasive searches based only on the hunches of government authorities.
Williams also asked why there was no audio for the drug dog alert.
As for why we don’t have audio from the dog handler in the Hankins case, his audio should have been recorded on a camera in his car.
But NewsChannel 5 Investigates asked for video from that camera, and we were told that, for reasons no one could explain, it does not exist.
I think I know the explanation. Just another data point in support of the  missing video presumption.

Infy wants employees to generate more revenueInfy wants employees to generate more revenue
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mumbai, November 12:  
Infosys wants the revenue generated by each employee to go up by 2016, on the back of new initiatives around big data, design thinking and a renewed push on automation.
Revenue per employee at Infosys currently stands at around $50,000, the highest in the industry. “If this number does not go up in two years, then we will have a problem,” Vishal Sikka, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, told delegates at the ‘Axis Capital Annual Conference’ via a webcast.
Non-linear growth
Non-linear revenue growth, which refers to an increase in overall sales without a proportional addition to the headcount, has been the holy grail of the Indian IT industry.
“Use of re-usable components, software automation and artificial intelligence are needed to drive non-linear growth in client engagements. We need to amplify our people assets with better tooling and automation,” said Sikka.
The scope to increase non-linear revenue is getting wider through opportunities around ‘big data’, which refers to large datasets that can reveal patterns and trends when computationally analysed.
For instance, Infosys says it is seeing strong demand for a new program that allows manufacturing companies to predict and plan for software breakdowns. “Recently, we worked with a company which has around 150,000 teller machines in the US. At any time, about 100 of them are down. We now have predictive analysis capabilities that can direct maintenance crews to where the next breakdown could probably happen,” said Sikka.
Infosys has already bagged 40 projects “around big data and predictive analyses” in the last two months, Sikka added.
Infosys is able to provide this service by developing a new data processing platform built on open source technology. The company has also partnered with Stanford’s Institute for Computation and Mathematical Engineering for data scientists who can work with Infosys’ teams.
‘Design thinking’
Sikka is also trying to bring about a cultural shift at Infosys by inculcating ‘design thinking’. He wants a problem-solving approach in which clients are an integral part of the entire product/services lifecycle.
“Essentially, our multi-functional teams sit with the client and try to define their problems and requirements. Rapid iterations and rapid prototyping are done to solve the problem,” said Sikka.
Infosys aims to train 30,000 of its employees in design thinking by the fiscal end.

Time to impose curbs on duty-free garment imports from Bangladesh‘Time to impose curbs on duty-free garment imports from Bangladesh’
Our Bureau
The Hindu Tough stand: To curb backdoor entry of Chinese products into the market, the government should impose sourcing restrictions for duty-free import from Bangladesh.
Corporate Economic Advisor voices concern over demand for incentives
Coimbatore, November 12:  
The Indian textile industry and policy makers are too focused on incentive schemes for export promotion. This does not augur well for the industry particularly when World Trade Organisation (WTO) obligation will force India to phase out all its export incentives for the sector by end of 2015, says corporate economic advisor Ritesh Kumar Singh.
Competitive neighbours
He was speaking on the role of trade policy in pushing exports and safeguarding domestic markets threatened by the ever-growing low priced imports from countries such as Bangladesh and China.
Advising Texpreneurs (a forum formed by Tamil Nadu based textile entrepreneurs) against seeking such sops from the Government, Singh said: “A well-conceived trade pact can open up opportunities on the textile export front but a badly negotiated free trade pact can lead to unintended consequences.”.
Stating that the textile sector in India is a clear loser when it comes to trade with Bangladesh, he said “it’s time India imposed some sourcing restrictions for permitting duty-free import of garments from Bangladesh, as that country does not possess fabric manufacturing facilities. While this will help textile exports to Bangladesh, it will also check backdoor entry of Chinese fabrics to India via Bangladesh.”
Tariff disadvantage
Highlighting the implication of Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) for textile export and import, he said: “We are at a disadvantage with regard to tariff; notwithstanding this, exporters from TPP member countries such as Vietnam get preferential access to the US market as compared to exporters from non-TPP countries like India, putting garments exports to the US in a difficult situation.”
“Similarly, the Yarn Forward Rule (YFR) makes it mandatory to source yarn, fabric and other inputs that are used in making clothes from TPP partner countries for availing duty preference. This will induce garment manufacturers in TPP countries to source their input from member nations, even if the suppliers in that region are not very efficient.
“TPP, therefore, is going to be the biggest challenge for the Indian textile industry as US accounts for close to a-fourth of India’s apparel exports and because of duty disadvantage with Vietnam, post the trade pact,” he said.
“Nevertheless, all is not lost. There are a few potential markets such as Brazil in Mercosur region that remain untapped. Inclusion of textile items under India-Mercosur Preferential Trade Agreement can help India’s exports, as textile items face prohibitive import duties ranging from 26 per cent to 35 per cent in Mercosur countries,” Singh said and advised the forum to seek Government help for providing marketing assistance to increase exports to Russia and other CIS countries.
Report
D Prabhu, Secretary of Texpreneurs Forum, told BusinessLine that they are in the process of submitting a report to the Central Government based on Singh’s suggestion and advice.

Investing: Pimco funds: Hold or fold0
Our answer: There's no need to panic, but it's time to consider other options. You'll find plenty of better alternatives run by firms that aren't engulfed by turmoil. What's more, caution is always warranted when any key manager leaves. And Gross made the big-picture calls on the economy and interest rates that steered the strategy of many Pimco funds. He also ran Pimco Total Return (symbol PTTDX), which until recently was the largest mutual fund.
The bond king wasn't always right. In 2013, the Newport Beach, Calif., firm made bad bets on emerging-markets debt and on Treasury inflation-protected securities. Both suffered big losses when interest rates rose in the middle of that year. The damage was extensive: More than half of Pimco's 87 funds ranked in the bottom half of their peer groups last year.
One bright spot is Pimco Income (PONDX), which has been in the top 20 percent of the multisector-bond-fund category in each of the past five years (including so far in 2014). Daniel Ivascyn, who co-manages Income, was promoted to group chief investment officer after Gross left.
Even before Gross's departure, it was an eventful year for Pimco. In March, Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's CEO and co-chief investment officer, left. And in mid September, news surfaced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating whether the firm inflated the returns of Pimco Total Return ETF (BOND), an exchange-traded fund that Gross ran.
Meanwhile, Pimco has had to deal with a yearlong run of redemptions. In September alone, investors withdrew nearly $26 billion more in assets from Pimco than they deposited. The lion's share of that, $18 billion, came out of Total Return. If you're thinking about bailing out of Total Return, figure out first if you'll be on the hook for capital-gains taxes. (If you hold the fund in a tax-deferred retirement account, you needn't worry about it.)
Should you follow Gross to his new fund? We'd wait. At Janus Global Unconstrained Bond, Gross will have more freedom to invest in any part of the bond market. That may or may not be a good thing. But he'll almost certainly have fewer resources at his disposal than he did at Pimco. If you want an unfettered bond fund, consider Metropolitan West Unconstrained Bond (MWCRX) or Osterweis Strategic Income (OSTIX), both members of the Kiplinger 25, the list of our favorite mutual funds.

U.S. lawmakers want criminal probe of Takata as air bag concerns growU.S. lawmakers want criminal probe of Takata as air bag concerns grow

U.S. lawmakers urge DOJ to investigate Takata and its fatal airbag defects.
Report: Takata knew of air bag defect as far back as 2004.
 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic lawmakers on Friday called for the U.S. Justice Department to examine whether air bag-maker Takata broke the law, as authorities study the dangers of the safety device that is now part of a sweeping recall.
The statement comes a day after the New York Times reported that officials with Takata Corp examined air bag dangers in 2004 but halted the probe after initial tests raised concerns.

The three mistakes of the AAPThe three mistakes of the AAP
Stanly Johny
It can redeem itself but first, it must establish its identity
November 10, 2014:  
Can Arvind Kejriwal do it again? With Delhi set for Assembly polls in a few months, the spotlight is back on the anti-corruption crusader and his fledgling political outfit. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which stormed Delhi’s political scene during last year’s Assembly polls, and subsequently formed the government with Congress support, has seen its fortunes slide ever since.
Before considering AAP’s prospects, we must understand where it went wrong. It made three explicit mistakes. The first was the decision to form the government in Delhi with support from the Congress. The AAP had mobilised its political capital before the polls on strong anti-Congress, anti-BJP rhetoric. It emerged as the second largest party with 28 seats, after the BJP’s 31 seats in the 70-member assembly. The Congress, which had ruled the city-state for 15 years, was trounced with a mere 8 seats. The AAP could have waited till the people gave them a clear majority to rule. Accepting Congress support was the first blow to its public image.
One mistake cannot be undone by another but the AAP tried to do so by abruptly ending its government after its failing to get the Lok Pal Bill passed. What they should have done was to focus on delivering the promises they had made in the manifesto. In their eagerness to go back to oppositional politics, the AAP seized the first opportunity to quit power, thus raising questions about its resolve and capability to deliver. The gravest error, though, was its failure to articulate an ideology.
By projecting itself as a non-ideological party, the AAP found it difficult to fit itself into the ideology-heavy political spectrum. The lack of clear economic and social vision contributed to the identity crisis. But all is not lost. The BJP has its own agenda; the Congress is weak. The upcoming election is a fresh opportunity for the AAP to reverse matters. Provided it presents itself as a party with an identity.

Bachchan Jr tackles the field at IIM KozhikodeBachchan Jr tackles the field at IIM Kozhikode
Vinay Kamath
THE HINDU Abhishek Bachchan takes a selfie with the students of IIMK in Kunnamangalam, Kozhikode. S RAMESH KURUP
Actor-turned-sports entrepreneur gets candid on his dreams for Indian football
Kozhikode, November 9:  
He oozed charm, spoke with wit and humour, and looked as hunky as he does on screen. They hung on to his every word, clapping gleefully at his smart rhetoric or whenever he pulled the leg of the professor in conversation with him. By the time he was done, Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan (who dislikes the term Bollywood!) had the future managers of IIM Kozhikode roaring for him.
The cheers started with the articulate Bachchan Jr saying he was prone to stage fright. When Prof Rahul Sett asked if he took tips from his famous dad for the stage, he brought the house down saying his dad was worse than him! No, he wasn’t intimidated, but, “I’m anxious as in this hall are some of the brightest minds in the country who will go on to be decision makers,” deadpanned Bachchan. The B-school had invited the celebrity for the second pan-IIM global management conference on ‘globalizing Indian thought’, given his role as a sports entrepreneur.
Getting sporty
Fielding first a range of questions on Bollywood, Western and Indian films, the business end of the conversation focused on his role as the owner of kabaddi and football teams. Getting into football, where he owns Chennaiyin FC, was a planned decision.
“I closely follow football and enjoy watching the game. What spurred me on was when I was in Brazil for the World Cup and met with FIFA President Seth Blatter, and he said, it was astonishing that you’re a country of 1.2 billion people and you can’t put a football team on the field. That really p****d me off! There’s no dearth of talent in the country, but there is no system for them to come through.” The main aim of the Indian Super League is to have an Indian team by 2026 in the World Cup finals. “And, if by 2026 we don’t, we are doing something wrong. But we need to start today,” emphasised Bachchan. The ISL has a mandate to take football to the youth, catch them young and put them through a programme for 10-12 years with the best coaches. “And when they are playing senior football they can represent the country. That is where most of ISL’s work comes in.” His remark that Kerala sees some of the best footballers was met with great applause.
Keeping it native
Bachchan’s foray into kabaddi, he said, was more happenstance. The commentator Charu Sharma invited him to watch a kabaddi match and his first reaction was, “Who plays kabaddi any more?” He was to be surprised as he discovered that Mumbai alone had 1,500 kabaddi clubs. That led to him investing in the Jaipur Pink Panthers in the Pro-Kabaddi League.
“Star TV did a great job of promoting the league. They said the benchmark was 50 million viewers for it to be a hit. At the end of six weeks of the league, they had had 493 million viewers. Kabaddi resonated with the Indian public,” said Bachchan. And, now more investors are coming forward to invest in teams, he adds. It’s an indigenous sport that needs a modern twist, he pointed out, adding that Indian kabaddi has won five world cups on the trot.
It needs 55 nations to play the sport for it to be included in the Olympics. Already 35 nations play kabaddi and Iceland has recently signed into the International Kabaddi Federation, said Bachchan. It is just a matter of time before it gets onto the world stage.
In response to whether he would teach a class at IIM K, the actor said he would rather attend as a student, since Prof Sett had remarked earlier that Indian films were badly planned affairs. “I could learn how best to plan a film,” said Bachchan with a grin.

Shipping Wars: Retailers Push Order Deadlines LaterEmail
The 2013 holiday shopping season was largely defined by its price wars.
And while those are sure to continue this year, another type of battle is  already starting to take shape: Shipping wars.
Despite a slew of late deliveries last holiday—the result of last-minute  delivery promises and a series of snowstorms—retailers are looking to get a leg  up on the competition by pushing Christmas deadlines for online orders even  later in the season. 
MIKE BLAKE / Reuters
A Federal Express truck on delivery is pictured in downtown Los Angeles, California October 29, 2014.
According to a new study by the Kurt Salmon consulting firm, which surveyed  more than 100 retailers with revenue greater than $750 million, 26 percent will  guarantee Christmas delivery for orders placed one to three days ahead of time.  That's up from 17 percent in 2013. What's more, nearly 50 percent will guarantee  on-time delivery for Christmas orders placed by Dec. 20. That's also up, from 37  percent last year.
Overall, these changes mean retailers plan to push back the final order date  for guaranteed Christmas arrival from an average of 6.9 days to 5.5 days. 
"Retailers are making ambitious promises in order to capture last-minute  online sales," said Steve Osburn, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon.  "But if you compare average delivery times with last-minute promises, there is a  gap that retailers will need to account for." 
The findings come as carriers FedEx and UPS are warning retailers  against the 11th-hour delivery promises that lead to shipping delays. Experts  remain torn as to whether retailers will listen. While some argue they will heed  the warning to protect their brand and build trust with shoppers, others say  they'll be unable to resist the temptation as the competition intensifies.
Video: A new study reveals that your best bet for shopping for gifts is the Monday before Thanksgiving, not Black Friday.
Earlier this season, a Shop.org study of 55 online retailers found that  nearly 80 percent of respondents were planning earlier deadlines. 
Jarrett Streebin, founder and CEO of EasyPost logistics company, remains  skeptical. "I think [the carriers are] really sort of whistling in the  dark," he said.
Last year, retailers said about 15 percent of orders arrived late. They're  aiming to trim this to 8 percent in 2014.
Companies are also competing over free shipping offers, which Target kicked off last month by offering free shipping on all  online orders through Dec. 20 . According to Kurt Salmon's study, 76 percent  of retailers are already offering some form of free shipping, compared with 35  percent last year.
Forrester Research predicts online sales will hit a record $89  billion during the final two months of the year, meaning carriers will be  met with even more volume. Both FedEx and UPS are boosting their holiday hiring  to accommodate the expected increase.

Chrysler replacing explosive Takata air bags in model year 2003 to 2007 vehicles.
DETROIT (Reuters) - Chrysler Group will begin replacing potentially defective air bag inflators made by Takata Corp in more than 371,000 U.S. vehicles in early December, according to documents filed by the automaker with U.S. safety regulators.
Read the story
Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said in documents filed with NHTSA that Takata "has made no determination of a safety defect" in the inflators being studied by the safety agency, but it would nonetheless begin replacing them no later than Dec. 19.
It could start the recall in parts of Florida in early December, according to the NHTSA documents.
The Chrysler vehicles include the Dodge Ram, Durango, Dakota, Charger and Magnum, and Chrysler Aspen and 300.
Takata was not immediately available for comment.
cComments
"...Takata "has made no determination of a safety defect" in the inflators being studied by the safety agency, but it would nonetheless begin replacing them no later than Dec. 19." It made no determination of defectiveness in its product, yet, it will replace 37.8 million...

The group of Takata inflators the NHTSA is studying - the so-called Beta series - totals 37.8 million, according to NHTSA documents. Of those, about 25 million are passenger-side inflators made from 2000-2004 and about 12.8 million are driver-side inflators made from 2004-2007.
Other manufacturers involved in the June regional recalls include Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co, BMW AG, Mitsubishi Motors Corp and Fuji Heavy Industries' Subaru.
Takata's air bag inflators are being investigated because, if exposed to moisture or improperly manufactured, they can explode, rupturing and sending metal shards into vehicle passenger compartments. The issue has been linked to four deaths and 160 injuries.
Since 2008, more than 11 million U.S. cars equipped with Takata air bags have been recalled because of the inflator issue.
Chrysler told NHTSA that it conducted a joint investigation with Takata of the Beta inflators, including samples obtained from Florida junkyards.
Takata's analysis showed the Florida inflators "exhibited slightly elevated levels of moisture," Chrysler said.
The automaker said Takata has been conducting a series of tests on suspect inflators, including CT scans, "live dissections" and live deployments, while measuring performance, moisture level and other physical and chemical properties.

Microsoft drops Nokia name with Lumia 535

Microsoft is trying to expand its small market share worldwide with cheaper devices.
TOPICS
PDAs and smartphones
Microsoft has unveiled a cheaper smartphone, costing about 110 euro ($135), as it eyes emerging and other low-cost markets for growth.
The new model is the first Lumia smartphone under Microsoft’s own brand name. The company has released a few Lumia models since it bought Nokia’s phone business this year, but those models still carried the Nokia brand.
The Lumia 535 Windows smartphone will have a 5-inch screen, as measured diagonally. It comes with 5-megapixel front and rear cameras, which should snap sharper selfies than typical smartphones.
Microsoft is trying to expand its small market share worldwide with cheaper devices.
To do that, it has cut manufacturing costs. For instance, camera and control buttons on many models can now be tapped on the screen rather than being physical buttons on the frame.
Despite the low cost, Microsoft said the new phone would offer the same Microsoft services that high-end phones did. That includes Skype video calls, Office apps and the virtual assistant Cortana.
As is common with phones for emerging markets, Microsoft is making a version with slots for two SIM cards so that people can switch between service providers more easily.
The Lumia 535 is expected to go on sale this month. Microsoft didn’t announce any U.S. plans.

Washington: General Motors, under investigation because of defective ignition switches linked to at least 32 deaths, is to cut more than 500 jobs at two plants in the United States.
Approximately 160 employees will be laid off during 2015 at a factory in Orion, Michigan to "better align with market demand," the company said in an email to AFP, and a plant in Lansing, in the same state, will eliminate 350 of its 1,500 positions for the same reason.
"GM is committed to a strong and lasting presence in Lansing," a spokesman said, adding that the US auto giant had pledged $281.5 million in investment for Lansing-based facilities since 2013.
General Motors last month reported lower third-quarter earnings on weakness in some international markets.
GM is under investigation by Congress, regulators and the US Justice Department over why it waited more than a decade after first uncovering the ignition-switch problem to start recalling cars.

Falling Inflations Brighten Outlook for Bond FundsYou are here: Home Your Money
Investing in Bank FDs? Why You Should Rethink
NDTV | Updated On: December 03, 2014 12:12 (IST)
RBI Doubles Pre-Paid Card Limit to Rs 1 Lakh
Bank fixed deposits have been among the most popular investment bets for a majority of Indians. They offer attractive rates (around 9 per cent for one year tenure) with almost no risk.
The negative aspect of fixed deposit investments is taxation. Interest on fixed deposits is added to the income of the investor and then taxed according to his/her tax slab.
(Read | Kisan Vikas Patra Vs Bank FD: What You Should Know )
A better deal for investors would be to put their money in debt mutual funds, analysts say. Debt instruments offer nearly same returns as fixed deposits, but provide better tax protection. Debt mutual funds invest in long-term government bonds, which have rallied sharply over the past month.
Why Government Bonds Have Rallied
There are expectations that the Reserve Bank of India will cut interest rates earlier-than-expected because of inflation has eased to multi-year lows. Hopes of a rate cut have made investments in government bonds attractive as these bonds were issued at higher coupons. The 10-year bond carries a coupon of 8.40 per cent, but its yield has already fallen to below 8 per cent levels, its lowest in over a year.
When yields fall, bond prices go up leading to substantial gains for debt mutual funds. The average one-year return from debt mutual funds that invest predominantly in medium-term to long-term government bonds has ranged above 15 per cent, according to Morningstar data. And in the past one month these funds have given over 2.5 per cent return.
A Balasubramanian, CEO of Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company, said bond markets are attractive from a medium-term perspective. He has been advising investors to take some exposure in government bond funds that have an average duration of 3-6 years.
Alternatively, Mr Balasubramanian suggests investors to invest in dynamic debt bond funds in which fund managers actively shuffle the bond portfolio to take advantage of emerging opportunities.
Jayesh Mehta, country treasurer at Bank of America (BofA), also expects the rally in bond markets to continue. In fact, he expects the bond yields on 10-year government bonds to fall by around 75 basis points in the next 8 to 12 months. This will further boost bond prices and lead to higher net asset value of debt mutual funds.
Analysts say improving liquidity in the financial system has also been attributed to the rally in bonds. High liquidity, however, has led to a fall in fixed deposit rates.
Tax Treatment
Debt mutual funds score over fixed deposits in terms of their taxation. Investors can claim indexation benefit on debt mutual fund schemes after three years, significantly lowering their tax outgo on the gains. On the other hand, the interest on fixed deposits is fully taxable. It is added to the income of the investor and taxed as normal income.
Rate Cut Outlook
Jayesh Mehta of Bank of America does not see the RBI cutting rates at its December 2 policy review. "The RBI will keep a close watch on the global oil prices, trend in vegetable prices and the government's fiscal situation given that the divestment programme has not yet kicked off," he said. But he is optimistic of the RBI cutting rates in the next six months.
Similarly, Mr Balasubramanian of Birla Sun Life AMC also does not see much chance of a rate cut on December 2. The RBI is likely to keep a watch on the inflation trend further before taking any rate action, he says. He expects the RBI cutting rates towards the middle of next year.
"Our outlook on interest rate remains positive" and investors betting on government bonds will gain, he said.

The industry has welcomed the decision of the Maharashtra Assembly to vote in favour of the Devendra Fadnavis led minority government stating it was a vote for development.
“The new government of Maharashtra should get adequate opportunity and support from political leadership and the public at large. More so as it is for the first time that development of the state is the single point agenda and the state government needs support for the same,” said D.S. Rawat, national secretary general of ASSOCHAM.
However, he maintained that the stand taken by both the Shiv Sena and the NCP is their internal matter and may be in the interest of their respective parties.
Commenting on the development Vijay Kalantri, president of All India Association of Industries (AIAI) said : " It is a welcome move that the BJP government has sailed through the trust vote. It is development oriented government and should be given a chance. Now the chief minister must concentrate on removing all the stumbling blocks that hindered growth in Maharashtra. All like minded parties should support this government."

US Regulator Warns Cadila Pharma Over Drug Production Processes
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 12:18 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Mumbai: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned privately owned drugmaker Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd that it was not following quality and manufacturing standards at one of its plants, which caused impurities in drug ingredients made there.
Cadila Pharmaceuticals is the latest Indian drugmaker to face US regulatory rebuke, as the FDA intensifies its scrutiny of the generic drugmakers.
The United States is the biggest market for India's $15-billion generics manufacturing sector, but a series of regulatory sanctions on large drugmakers including Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd and Wockhardt Ltd over the past year have hurt the country's reputation as a supplier of safe and affordable drugs.
In a warning letter posted on its website late on Tuesday, the FDA said inspectors in March had found "significant deviations" from standard manufacturing practices at Cadila Pharmaceuticals' Ankleshwar plant in Gujarat state.
The FDA issued the letter on October 15, and gave the company 15 days to respond. If Cadila Pharmaceuticals fails to take measures to correct the violations, the agency can ban exports to the United States from the plant.
A spokesman for Cadila Pharmaceuticals, which supplies drugs to more than 85 countries including the United States, Japan and Kenya, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The FDA said the inspection showed the company did not adequately probe or take corrective action after customer complaints between 2011 and 2012 about unpleasant odours from, and impurities in, certain drug batches sold in the United States.

Petrol, Diesel Prices Likely to be Cut This Weekend
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 12, 2014 15:26 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Petrol and diesel prices are likely to be cut by close to Rs 1 per litre this weekend on the back of sliding global oil rates.
This would be the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August and the third in rates of diesel since its decontrol last month.
(Read: How diesel price deregulation impacts you )
Following their fortnightly review practice, state-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) are due to revise rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday.
In all probability, rates will be reduced if the current trend of declining international oil prices continues, industry sources said.
Petrol price was last cut by Rs 2.41 a litre on November 1. On the same day, the price of diesel was also reduced by Rs 2.25 per litre. ( Read more )
Since August, petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs 9.36 per litre.
At present, a litre of petrol in the national capital costs Rs 64.25 a litre, while diesel costs Rs 53.35 a litre.
Diesel price was for the first time in more than five years cut on October 19, by Rs 3.37 a litre, when the government decided to deregulated the fuel. This was followed by another cut on November 1.
Prior to the October 19 reduction, diesel rates were last cut in January 2009.
Sources said oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee-US dollar exchange rate.
Brent crude fell for a third day amid signs that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members are reluctant to reduce supply even as prices slumped deeper into a bear market. It declined by 82 cents to $80.85 per barrel. ( Read more )
Brent has lost almost 30 per cent since its June peak amid speculation that global supply is outpacing demand.

Tanya Constantine/Blend Images / APFive ways to always get a good deal on a bed
Ben Popken TODAY
Email
"Powercoil." "Foam density." "Fabric technology." Are we buying a mattress or fixing Matthew McConaughey's space ship in Interstellar?
These layers of confusing  jargon do little to comfort stressed-out consumers looking for a new mattress. To help cut through the clutter, we contacted a retired industry insider known as "The Old Bed Guy." The 85-year old former bed maker and seller now runs a popular mattress consumer information site where he gives out his (somewhat cranky) advice.
“Mattresses have no real value,” said 'Marshall Coyle,' a pseudonym he uses to avoid blowback from the tight-knit mattress community to which he used to belong.
That statement is a rude awakening to anyone who's peeped at the price tags after taking a stroll through a mattress showroom lately. With prices running into the thousands, dreams of better "zzz's" are quickly zapped by sticker shock.
Tanya Constantine/Blend Images / AP
The Old Bed Guy is talking about the markup versus the actual value of the steel, foam, and wool that goes inside a bed. For example, he said, it might cost a factory $600 to make a mattress that they sell to a big department store for $1,300. That store might then slap a price of $2,999 on it, then give it a big discount during one of the never-ending sales, he said.
"The money goes for something other than what you're sleeping on," said Coyle.
While every business is entitled to try to make a profit, every maker also has its own special lingo. That makes true comparison shopping difficult. Some of the differences are real. Some are just marketing vapor. 
Rather than try to explain it all and risk being as bewildering as the confusion we're supposed to be relieving, here are 5 tips from the perspective of The Old Bed Guy that always get you a better deal on a mattress, no matter what store or manufacturer you're dealing with.
Look for stores that have their own factories
A few smaller regional stores make their own mattresses in their own factories. That cuts out the middleman. "I don't know of a better way as far as value," said Coyle.
Stores in this category include Charles P. Rogers, McRoskey, Original Mattress Factory, and Verlo. Their stores aren't everywhere, but the savings and quality difference is enough that this reporter nearly considered a 10-hour road trip just to get a bed.
Buy based on weight
If you're a fan of strong, long-lasting steel coils, a heavier mattresses usually mean there's more quality materials inside. "They have 12-15 inches to fill," said The Old Bed Guy. "You can stretch your coils and make them tall and thin."
Typical mass-produced beds weigh about 90 lbs while higher grade beds can weigh around 120 lbs, he said. But you won't find this info online, you'll have to buttonhole the sales agent or bed maker to get the details.
Buy at the end of the year
"If anything is for real," said Coyle of the mattress business, "the periods when people don't buy mattresses see the best deals." 
Few buy before Christmas, saving room on the credit card for the holiday shopping spree. The last 2 weeks of December are a prime time as stores try to unload inventory before the new year. Good savings can also be had the first two weeks of January.
Be careful with Internet-only stores
Some online outfits say they pass on the savings of not having any retail outlets. But it's not that hard to set up a shop and outsource manufacturing and shipping to China. That can create an accountability gap that leaves consumers in a lurch if their bed starts giving them lumps. "If they won't give you their street address, don't give them your credit card," said Coyle.
What about latex?

Why Fadnavis will find it tough to run MaharashtraWhy Fadnavis will find it tough to run Maharashtra

The Shiv Sena's decision to oppose the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in a voice vote in the Maharashtra assembly on Wednesday was not a dream start for chief minister Devendra Fadnavis by any means.

Even though Fadnavis proved majority in the 288-member assembly amid protests by the Opposition, the Sena's stand could spell trouble for the BJP in the days to come.
Fadnavis, who wants to model his government on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's at the Centre, will now have to lead a minority government.
With Sena staking claim to the Opposition leader's post, CM Fadnavis may not be able to follow Modi, who is sailing on a full majority in the Parliament.
In the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, the BJP has 121 MLAs - down from 122 after Mukhed MLA Govind Rathod died of a heart attack on October 26. While the Shiv Sena has 63 MLAs, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has 41 legislators. The Sharad Pawar-led NCP has offered unconditional support to the BJP.
While Sena's dissent frees Fadnavis of a troublesome coalition ally, his government may now have to be dependent on the whims and fancies of NCP chief Pawar, even as it combats an Opposition led by the Sena, former BJP ally.
For starters, it translates into keeping a high-decibel corruption agenda on the back foot.
The NCP, however, reiterated after the trust vote that it wanted a stable government in the state.
"We will not destabilise the government in Maharashtra. We respect the mandate of people," NCP leader Nawab Malik told ANI, adding his party will not join the government.
Sources in the BJP admit its long-term plan has always been to occupy Sena territory in the state completely and, in case of a minority government, break legislators away from its saffron ally.
In the meanwhile, however, Fadnavis will have to walk a tightrope.
Besides not delivering on promises such as taking action in the irrigation scam, he will face hurdles to get his pet legislations like the Right to Services, Lokayukta Act and amendment to the Bombay Police Act passed unless the NCP is on board.
While getting bills and even the budget cleared in the state assembly may not be a problem given its strength of 122 legislators, the numbers go against the BJP in the legislative council (only 11 MLCs as opposed to NCP's 28, Congress 22 and Sena's eight).
The party will have to be at the mercy of the NCP in the council to get anything cleared for at least the next two years, till it can stake claim to many more MLC posts as and when the tenure of existing legislators expires.
By losing the support of 63 Sena legislators, the Fadnavis-led government will also open itself up to scrutiny and attack by a resurgent Opposition that will include three parties (considering the NCP has also taken a stance of being in the Opposition).
This means an attack on several fronts and may hinder delivering on promises made on toll-free roads, drip irrigation subsidies for farmers, welfare schemes for sugarcane farmers and pension schemes for women.
"With the state's financial health in a precarious position, delivering on the development agenda is going to be difficult. If Fadnavis has to prove himself, he will have to take some tough calls and that is not easy without a full majority,'' said a senior BJP leader.
Congress' newly elected deputy leader, Vijay Wadettiwar, said, "There have been so many empty promises by BJP that our line of attack will be easy. We have studied all of Modi's speeches made during the Assembly campaign and we will start by picking holes in them.''

Karnataka planters peg coffee output flat at 3 lakh tonnesKarnataka planters peg coffee output flat at 3 lakh tonnes
Vishwanath Kulkarni
Parimala Rao Arabica coffee beans
Bangalore, Nov 12:  
Coffee production for the current season that began in October is likely to remain at last year’s level of around three lakh tonnes, on lower production of Arabicas, a growers’ body said.
“The Robusta crop is slightly bigger than last year, but a lower Arabica crop would keep the total size at last year’s levels,” said D Govindappa Jayaram, Chairman of the Karnataka Planters Association, ahead of the annual meet of the growers body.
“We expect the Arabica crop size to shrink to between 60,000 and 70,000 tonnes, while Robusta would be largely in line with the Coffee Board’s post-blossom estimate of 2.39 lakh tonnes,” he said.
Jayaram attributed the decline in Arabicas to high incidence of white stem borer and berry droppings caused by excess rainfall, mainly in key growing areas of Kodagu, Hassan and Chikmagalur. The 2014-15 is an off-year of the biennial production cycle for Arabicas, wherein output drops every alternate year. Further, the output of this mild and premium variety is also expected to suffer on account of diseases such as leaf rot and stalk rot that were caused by excess continuous precipitation, Jayaram said.
In its post-blossom estimates, the State-run Coffee Board had pegged the 2014-15 crop higher at 3.44 lakh tonnes comprising 1.05 lakh tonnes of Arabicas and 2.39 lakh tonnes of Robustas. The Board is yet to come out with its post-monsoon forecast for the 2014-15 season.
According to the Board’s final estimates for 2013-14, coffee output was 3.045 lakh tonnes, comprising 1.02 lakh tonnes of Arabicas and 2.023 lakh tonnes of Robustas.
Karnataka accounts for about two-thirds of the coffee produced in the country and the KPA is the apex growers’ body in the State. The fly-picking or the plucking of early ripened berries of the arabica variety has already commenced in parts of Kodagu and the full scale harvest is set to commence early December.
Further, Govindappa said the domestic coffee plantations have to increase productivity to be sustainable and remain viable as other large producers such as Brazil and Vietnam were way ahead of India on this count.
The KPA chief also suggested that the Government encourage adoption of ‘green technologies’ by planters by incentivising the usage of solar generators, wind and bio-gas generators at the plantations. He also opined that a subsidy for creation of estate brands will increase the visibility of Indian coffee, both in the domestic and overseas markets.

Retail inflation declines to 5.5% in OctoberRetail inflation declines to 5.5% in October
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 12:  
Helped by softening prices of food items, the retail inflation declined to 5.52 per cent in October, the lowest since the new series of data was introduced in January 2012.
This is the fourth consecutive month of decline in the Consumer Price Index based inflation or retail inflation which had fallen to 6.46 per cent in the previous month.
The overall food inflation measured on CPI came down to 5.59 per cent in October as against 7.67 per cent in the previous month.
Retail prices of vegetables declined by 1.45 per cent as against a rise of 8.59 per cent in September, according the data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
Inflation in fruits slowed to 17.49 per cent from 22.4 per cent in September. Similarly the rate of price rise in eggs, fish and meat items was at 6.34 per cent in October, slightly down from 6.35 per cent in the previous month.
The data on inflation based on Wholesale Price Index for October will be released on Friday. WPI inflation had dropped to a near five-year low in September to 2.38 per cent, helped by moderation in food and fuel prices.
The Reserve Bank has of late started targeting retail inflation, while deciding on its bi-monthly monetary policy. RBI has been targeting a retail inflation of 8 per cent by March 2015 and 6 per cent by March 2016. RBI’s next monetary policy is due on December 2, 2014.

Railways allows 100% FDI for bio-toilets  la...bio-toilets
(Railways has identified…)
NEW DELHI: Railways has identified toilets as one of the 17 special areas where 100 per cent foreign and private investment can bring about major investments.
According to the guidelines approved by the government under its FDI policy, 100 per cent FDI can be utilised in facilities like cleaning up trains and installation of bio-toilets in passenger coaches and setting up of mechanised laundry facilities.
It is a step forward to invite private and foreign investment in the Railways as new areas have been identified for FDI, said a senior Railway Ministry official, adding that "total 17 areas are now thrown open under the guidelines".
A committee constituted by Railway Ministry to finalise the policy has also suggested a set of business models to attract investments.
Besides bio-toilets, cleaning operation and mechanised laundries, the areas identified by the committee for FDI include construction, maintenance and operation facilities to supply non-conventional sources of energy to the Railways, installation and maintenance of bio-toilets in passenger trains, setting up of technical training institutes, testing facilities and laboratories and providing technological solutions to improve safety.
Earlier, the government had relaxed the FDI norms permitting 100 per cent investment in rail projects, such as high-speed trains, suburban service, dedicated freight corridors, freight and passenger terminals.
The FDI is also being permitted for rail route electrification, signalling system and logistics parks.
The committee has suggested three business models for high-speed train projects including projects where there are limits on operations and a firm wants to invest in upgrading the existing rail network for speed above 120 km per hour or semi-high speed network.
In dedicated freight lines, the Railways has permitted operations by investors, subject to certain conditions.
The government has now allowed mechanised laundry facilities to be set up on public-private partnership (PPP) basis. It also suggested some freight lines -- new and doubling -- that could be taken up on PPP basis.

Maharashtra: 5 Congress MLAs suspended for two years for allegedly heckling governorComments
Five Congress legislators were suspended by Maharashtra assembly speaker Haribhau Bagde for two years for allegedly heckling and physically stopping governor C Vidyasagar Rao as he entered the Vidhan Bhawan on Wednesday.

Revenue minister Eknath Khadse proposed their suspension saying that the governor had received "injuries" on his left hand during the incident.
Congress MLAs who have been suspended are Jaykumar Gore, Rahul Bondre, Abdul Sattar, Amar Kale and Virendra Jagtap.
A House panel is set to probe the incident and submit its report during the winter session of the legislature.
Meanwhile, all five suspended Congress members of Maharashtra assembly have denied causing injury to Maharashtra governor C Vidyasagar Rao and alleged that the entire episode was a "conspiracy" by the BJP government.
Talking to reporters, Congress MLAs Rahul Bondre, Jaykumar Gore, Virendra Jagtap, Abdul Sattar and Amar Kale said they did not heckle the governor.
"The BJP legislator Girish Mahajan's account of the alleged incident was taken as an eye-witness account, while we were not given a chance to put forth our side of the story.
Mahajan's presence at the place of protest itself is suspicious, since he is the Governor's bodyguard. How was he present there?" they said.
The MLAs appealed to reporters asking them to examine the the facts, since they too were present at the venue.
"We are confident that we will be proved innocent after the probe. If the government keeps us out for two years, we will tour the entire state and go to the people to highlight wrongdoings of the BJP government," they said.

Sterilisation deaths: Protesters storm streets in ChhattisgarhComments
Furious protesters took to the streets in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday as activists complained standard procedures and guidelines were not followed in the state's mass government-run sterilisation programme that left 13 women dead.

A team of doctors rushed to Bilaspur to investigate the deaths following the operations performed by a doctor accused of using rusty equipment in an operation theatre that had not been used for four months.
The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly because of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines. The victims had suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure after undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation, a simple process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked.
"Preliminary examinations suggest septic shock may have caused the deaths," said local government official Amar Thakur. "It looks like the equipment that was used was probably infected. We are waiting for the report."
A total of 83 women, all villagers under the age of 32, had the operations on Saturday and were sent home that evening, but more than 50 became seriously ill later and had to be hospitalised.
The expert team from Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) reviewed the clinical details of the women who fell ill, but did not say what led to the deaths.
"All of us unanimously think that the cause of the illness can only be ascertained after all laboratory results and post-mortem findings are available," said Dr Anjan Tirkha, who headed the seven-member team.
Sources said the death may have been caused by drugs prescribed to the patients or internal malfunctioning resulting in renal failure, respiratory failure and liver infections.
The doctor has been accused of operating on more than 80 women in just a few hours with the help of two assistants in an abandoned private hospital, officials said.
Police have filed a case of causing death by negligence against the doctor, RK Gupta, Bilaspur IGP Pawan Dev told HT.  The state government rewarded Gupta on January 26 for accomplishing his target of laproscopic tubectomies.
N Sarojini, founder and director, Sama Resource Group for Women and Health, said the Bilaspur surgeries violated Supreme Court orders saying that a medical team can conduct a maximum of 30 operations in a day with two separate laparoscopes.
"One doctor cannot do more than 10 sterilisations in one day, yet the surgeon in Chattisgarh did an astounding 83 surgeries in a short span of five to six hours… The scale of these deaths and critical morbidity clearly show that these operations were not done under standard protocols," she said.
"The only step that has been taken by the government till now is to announce Rs. 4 lakh compensation for the families of the dead and suspension of some doctors. These steps are not adequate to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. The systemic failures that led to this incident need to be addressed."
Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised. Women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as incentive to undergo the procedure.
Shiv Kumari Yadav, 26, and Parvati Bai, 25, said they would not have opted for the procedure had they known about the surgeries were carried out in an unhygienic operation theatre. "Two women were simultaneously handled on the two parallel beds by the doctors," said one of the patients.
The Chhattisgarh high court has issued notices to the union and state governments as well as the Medical Council of India seeking a detailed report within 10 days.

Bharat Petroleum Posts 50 Per Cent Fall in Q2 Profit
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 12, 2014 21:50 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) on Wednesday reported a 50 per cent drop in net profit for the quarter ended September 2014 as refining margin dipped on slumping international oil prices.
Net profit in July-September at Rs 464.20 crore, or Rs 6.42 per share, was 50 per cent lower than Rs 931.13 crore, or Rs 12.88 a share, in the same period a year ago, the company said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
The company earned $2.36 on turning every barrel of crude oil into product as opposed to a gross refining margin of $4.38 per barrel last year.
Turnover was marginally higher at Rs 62,025.16 crore in the second quarter as compared to Rs 61,784.51 crore in the same period a year ago.
BPCL said almost all its losses incurred on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at rates below cost were made up by cash subsidy from government (Rs 1,505.80 crore) and support from upstream firms like ONGC (Rs 3530.79 crore).
However, because of unmet losses of first quarter, the company had to in first half of current fiscal absorb Rs 503.42 crore.
Sales rose to 17.13 million tonnes when compared to 16.38 million tonnes, it said adding that the increase was mainly in petrol (10.34 per cent), LPG (12.03 per cent) and diesel (Rs 1.92 per cent).

Brent Oil Slips Towards $81 a Barrel  Near 4-Year LowGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
London: Brent crude slipped near $81 a barrel on Wednesday, just above a four-year low hit in the previous session with prices under pressure from the growing oil glut created by the US shale boom and the restart of Libya's largest operational oilfield.
With oil prices down 30 per cent since June, delegates in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are starting to suggest they may push for an informal output cut of around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) when the producer group meets in Vienna on November 27.
But they have warned an agreement within OPEC will not be easy, and many oil traders and analysts doubt members will take a decisive stance as they compete to hold onto market share.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, said its oil production was little changed in October in OPEC's monthly report on Wednesday, even as the group forecast demand for its oil next year will drop to 29.2 million bpd - almost 1 million less than it is currently producing.
"The consensus view is OPEC won't take any action, or if it does, not big enough or sufficiently definitive to have too much impact on prices," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets.
Brent for December delivery fell 61 cents to $81.06 by 1453 GMT (8:23 p.m. in India). It dropped 67 cents on Tuesday after first touching $80.46, its lowest since September 2010.
US crude was down 65 cents at $77.29 a barrel.
Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said an unofficial 500,000-bpd cut by OPEC would be "by no means enough to restore any sort of balance" to the oil market.
"Evidently the market is keen to test out OPEC's pain threshold," Mr Fritsch said.
Adding to supply, Libya restarted production at its large El Sharara oilfield, a spokesman for National Oil Corp (NOC) said, though exports remained blocked from the 120,000-bpd Hariga port by protesters involved in a wage dispute. The smaller El Feel field is also shut.
The oil minister of Iran, one of the OPEC members hardest hit by lower prices, on Tuesday met Kuwait's emir as part of a tour aimed at winning support to stabilise oil markets. Kuwait's oil minister has said a cut is unlikely.
US oil inventory data due on Wednesday and Thursday could show a build in crude stocks of 800,000 barrels in the week ended November 7, according to a Reuters poll of analysts. The data has been delayed for a day by a federal holiday.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Odisha: Reporters find 200 in kit provided by BJD MP in press meet  lodge a complaintComments
Pinaki Mishra, the ruling Biju Janata Dal MP from Puri, on Wednesday found himself in a spot when reporters found Rs. 200 notes in the kits provided to them in a press meet being addressed by him.
Taking affront, the scribes put the currency notes on Mishra’s table and left the venue in protest. They later lodged a complaint with Puri police.
Puri superintendent of police Ashish Singh admitted they have received a complaint. “I have asked my officers to inquire the matter,” he said.
“Putting currency notes in the media kit is an insult to journalists. The sad part is it was the government officials who distributed the kits,” local journalist Jagannath Bastia said.
Mishra, who was addressing the press in the temple town as the chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development, regretted the incident and said he had no idea about the currency notes in the kits. “I condemn it. I will ask the organizers of the press meet to take strongest possible action against those behind the irresponsible act. No one should be spared for his attempt to lower the dignity of the forth estate,” he said.
The press meet was organised by a nationalized bank.
Condemning the incident, leader of the opposition and senior Congressman Narasingha Mishra said it reflected the ruling party’s character. “The BJD has brazenly tried to use money power in whatever it does,” he said.

In cloud computing push  IBM keen to nurture start-upsIn cloud computing push, IBM keen to nurture start-ups
Venkatesh Ganesh
Vanitha Narayanan
Bangalore, November 12:  
In an effort to give its cloud computing segment a boost, IBM has extended its Global Entrepreneur Program to Indian start-ups. The initiative comes with $120,000 in credits that can be used to buy the company’s software.
Further, start-ups selected to be part of the programme will receive technical support, have access to a network of mentors and get introductions to some of IBM’s enterprise clients, said Vanitha Narayanan, MD, IBM India, addressing delegates at the CeBIT India conference.
IBM is focusing on recruiting start-ups that are less than five years old and that have already raised some funds from angel investors, accelerators or venture capitalists, according to company sources. 
The company is taking this outreach approach as it is under intense fire due to poor growth over recent quarters, which has impacted its financial performance, said the analysts. This push towards cloud computing is starting to gain considerable steam. Last year, it bought SoftLayer Technologies for $2 billion. Similarly, IBM has partnered with other software companies such as JDA and last month opened a 30,000 square feet facility in Mumbai that is part of an expansion to 15 cloud centres.  This is in addition to a $1.2-billion investment by IBM Cloud to expand its cloud computing presence around the world. Big Blue is following in the footsteps of rival Microsoft, which through Microsoft Ventures, has reached out to start-ups by offering free software and mentorship. This, in turn, helps adoption of its Azure and other Microsoft software by businesses all over the world. Other firms such as Intel Capital and Qualcomm have similar initiatives.  Technology giants are seeing a lot of growth in the technology start-up ecosystem. According to a recent Nasscom report, with 3,100 technology start-ups, the country is home to the third-largest start-up base in the world.
An additional driving force is a four-fold increase in access to capital through VCs, angel investments and seed funding. This is allowing Indian entrepreneurs to build tailor-made products for their customers, attracting multinationals as well as Indian investors, says R Chandrashekhar, President of Nasscom.

AMU students slam media on  women ban rowAligarh Muslim University Women’s College Students’ Union (AMUWCSU) and AMU Students’ Union (AMUSU) today organised a joint protest against alleged “biased media reports” over the issue of access to girls to the university’s central Maulana Azad Library.
More than 2000 girls took out a procession culminating at the Sir Syed crossing here.
“We are deeply outraged by the manner in which the media has distorted our demands for access to Maulana Azad library and has presented it in a highly biased manner,” newly-elected president of the AMUWCSU Gulfiza Khan said while addressing the protesters.
She said that some misguided individuals in the media were trying to project a highly distorted version of their demand which is very painful.
The protesters later burnt an effigy of a leading English news daily, which, they alleged, was spreading malicious news.
The procession was being followed by a separate similar protest led by the office bearers of newly-elected students union.
In a press release issued jointly by the AMUSU and AMUWCSU, the protesters said, “the AMU at present already provides an unrestricted entry to all girls from undergraduate, postgraduate and research courses”.
“We demand that the HRD Ministry should provide additional funds so that the Women’s College library, which is away from the main University campus, should become suitably equipped to cater to the demands of the undergraduate girls of the women’s college” they said.
Referring to the reported notice issued by the HRD Minister to the AMU Vice Chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah, the statement said,”if the HRD Minister is so concerned about the girls students at AMU, she should immediately sanction funds for upgrading the Women’s College library”.
“We are deeply concerned over the manner in which communal forces in the country are distorting the entire incident and giving it a biased colour. We strongly oppose the politics of hate and division which is very harmful for the nation,” the statement further said.
The joint press release also criticised the AMU VC for making “careless remarks” in this connection which led to the confusion in the entire matter.
The student leaders have asked the VC to refrain from issuing such statements in the future.
The Vice Chancellor yesterday came under attack over his controversial remarks regarding the access of undergraduate girls to a varsity library with HRD Minister Smriti Irani having termed the matter an “insult to daughters”.
The VC courted controversy as he turned down a demand of students of the varsity’s Women’s College for access to its main library, saying there would be “more boys” in the library if girls were allowed there.
However, the AMU had cited space constraints and refuted the charge of having a “sexist approach”.

India's grand ambitions of developing 50,000 MW of nuclear power capacity in the next 15 years cannot be realised without getting the States on board.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Ms J. Jayalalithaa's staking a claim to the entire electricity to be generated from the 2,000 megawatt (MW) Koodankulam nuclear power project merits consideration. Not because of the acute power shortage that the State is currently reeling under, but to give practical shape to the national goal of ensuring energy security consistent with the multilateral commitments on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. For all the Centre's protestations on having done ‘due diligence' with regard to site location, engineering design, plant safety, etc, the fact remains that sections of the public, especially those in the project area, have serious misgivings about nuclear power. Compounding the problem is the model of nuclear power generation, which involves setting up plants in a few select places, with each such project site housing significantly larger capacities than what used to be the norm earlier.
The existing 20 nuclear plants in India have a combined capacity of less than 5,000 MW, each typically of 220 MW and going up to 540 MW. As against this, Koodankulam alone is expected to have at least another two 1,000 MW reactors, if not more. Similarly, the proposed nuclear complex at Jaitapur in Maharashtra is seen to eventually house 10,000 MW of generation capacity. Implementing projects of this scale requires bringing the respective States, too, into the picture, not just for acquiring land and managing the local environment amidst growing NGO activism, but even to handle emergency evacuations of the sort seen after the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011. It calls for an altogether different level of Centre-State cooperation, including establishing joint risk management and safety assessment mechanisms. The right precedent here would probably be the Delhi Metro, which succeeded only because of the Delhi Government under Ms Sheila Dikshit being made an equal partner in the venture. In the case of Koodankulam, one should give some credit to Ms Jayalalithaa's Government for announcing a Rs 500 crore package for infrastructure development in the area, with a view to allay apprehensions of the local communities. And it is not only in Koodankulam; in all large nuclear projects under conception, States would have to play a more active role. Common sense, then, demands that the Centre endows them with a stake in the success of projects, going far beyond the existing 50:50 formula of power sharing between the host State and those in the neighbourhood.
While allocating the entire power from Koodankulam to Tamil Nadu is one way of ensuring its success, one can offer other justifications as well for the State Government’s stance. For instance, if States are entitled to royalty on their coal reserves used in thermal power stations, why cannot a similar incentive be given to those bearing the disproportionate risks on account of hosting nuclear plants? The broader point is that India's grand ambitions of developing 50,000 MW of nuclear power capacity in the next 15 years cannot be realised without getting the States on board.

The several habits of exceptionally frugal peopleThe several habits of exceptionally frugal people
By Anya Kamenetz, Tribune Content Agency, The Savings Game
eBay Inc. Amazon.com Inc.
On the top of my washer-dryer, there's a bucket full of old cut-up T-shirts and other scraps that we use for cleaning instead of buying paper towels. I stock up on six months' worth of toilet paper at a time -- it comes out to 50 cents for a giant roll. And when the dish soap is almost empty, I add water to the bottle to get out the final dregs.
I'm pretty sure I'm not alone. Everybody has a few areas where they're just a little more frugal, and some people are extreme savers -- cutting corners in every possible way. I found the following tips on the online community Reddit and elsewhere around the Web. Some are great ideas and some are, well, acquired tastes. What's your most extreme saving habit?
--Clothes
"I'll go to Macy's, look around, try stuff on, then check eBay. I've found clothing on the shelf $29.99 go for a few bucks on eBay new or like new."
"Some people wear clothes and then wash them, but I've gotten into the habit of wearing my clothes more than once if they're not really dirty."
"Use a clothesline instead of the dryer. Saves wear and tear."
"Hand wash instead of paying for dry cleaning."
--Food
cComments
Toilet Paper is obsolete and a complete waste of money. Cleaning with water from a Hand Bidet Sprayer is 10X better than smearing with wads of toilet paper and you never run out. Healthier, Greener, Cleaner and feels great too! See www.bathroomsprayers.com.

"I bring my own bottle of water wherever I go. It saves me $3 a trip going to the store to get some."
"You check out the dumpster and you can find garbage bags FULL of bagels, which you can freeze and will last you for a very long time."
"Get a vacuum bag sealer. This will make frozen food last longer. Also freeze your meats/veggies. They can last six months to a year in an airtight bag."
--Repairs/DIY
"General home maintenance. Know how to replace a section of pipe under the sink, for example, or how to install a new dishwasher. Know how to take apart your washer/dryer/stove/whatever and fix small problems."
"Learn to cut your own hair."
--Coupons/Deals
"Stockpiling ... this is the key to couponing. It is buying items when on sale before you need them in order to maximize your savings."
"I will not buy cereal unless it's under $1; deodorant must be 50 cents or less; sports drinks have to be under 80 cents; shampoo must be $1 or less; lip balm and panty liners have to be free."
--Household items
"Use 50/50 water/vinegar as a multipurpose surface cleaner, vinegar plus baking soda to clean carpet and laundry stains, straight vinegar to kill weeds."
"Dryer sheets: Vinegar plus essential oils plus old sheets cut into rectangles."
"I use the no poo method: Rinse hair with baking soda and vinegar instead of shampoo."
"Old school safety razor instead of Mach 3 or other disposables. The refills (available on Amazon) are super cheap. Like $20 for 200 double sided blades."
--Transportation
"Learn to hypermile your vehicle." ("Hypermiling" refers to getting the maximum mileage out of your car by driving at low speeds, avoiding quick acceleration or braking and all idling, as well as coasting when possible.)
"Costco/Sam's Club for gas. The savings for that alone pays for my yearly membership before I even walk in the store."
"Walk or bike any trip less than 5 km."
--Entertainment
"And for a not so healthy frugal tip, own a hip flask!"
"Go to the library for DVDs also. I've never had a Netflix account."
--Other
"Craigslist ... Have a working list of things you're looking for, then continually scan for them. Smartphone Craigslist apps are great for this."
"To deal with the Texas heat, I've used ice in front of a fan."
"Check out hairstyling/esthetics programs in your area and have students cut your hair/do your nails, etc."
"Choose a rescue dog, and get a smaller, shorthair breed to save on food and grooming."
"I cut up worn out and ripped flannel sheets to make our family cloth." ("Family cloth" is scraps of cloth some people use instead of toilet paper. Yes, it's true.)

Cover Letter Etiquette: Does  Dear Sirs  Cut Itreddit
How important is getting the name of the hiring manager for your cover letter? As a Career Coach I get asked this all the time!
If you are going to send a cover letter then you must (try to) find out the name and address the letter accordingly. In a competitive market it is the small things that can separate you from your competition, and correctly addressing your cover letter could be that defining factor.
However, often a name is not on the advert, so if you are serious about your job search and this is really the job you want, then it is certainly worth the time and effort to find this out.
So, here's my detective guide to sourcing the all-elusive name:
Do you know anyone who works there? Companies often have referral schemes so an existing employee could recommend you, which can add value to your application, especially if they are well regarded or in a senior position.
Call reception and explain you want to address the job application to the specific person. They should be willing to help and give you the name of the recruitment or hiring manager.  However, some companies do have a no name policy and won't give you any information, yet other companies will put you through to the recruitment team (or even the hiring manager) without question.
LinkedIn is the next stop. An advert will normally state the job title of who the role reports, so gather whatever information you can from the advert and speaking to reception, then from here you can start a search.
If there are a few options on LinkedIn, identify the most likely person and revert back to reception asking to confirm the name. Name-dropping will often help due to familiarity. You can even just call and say, "I just wanted to check (name) is still the Recruitment Manager for the (relevant team where the job is based) as I am sending an invite to an event."  Use whatever tactics you need to get the results you want. All you need to know is that you have the right person.
Once you have the name, should you aim to speak to the hiring or recruitment manager?
This is a difficult one as it does depend on the company, manager, culture, and how confident you are in picking up the phone and talking to a stranger.
But, there are huge commercial benefits to be gained from engaging the recruitment or hiring manager, so if you do have the opportunity of speaking directly to them and they are open and receptive to you, then I would take advantage of this and follow the next steps:
Have one or two relevant questions ready -- beyond what is available on the advert -- that will give you a greater insight into the role. Do not ask what is freely available on the advert, it must show thought and consideration has been applied.
Your question could be expanding on what is detailed in the advert. For example, if it says it is for a new team, is this Greenfield opportunity or just a restructure? This information can be used to highlight your experience in this area in your cover letter.
If you don't have specific experience requested in the advert you could ask, "in the absence of X what experience would you be looking for instead?"
Remember hiring is not solely down to experience, fit is often MORE important. If you can get an insight into the culture of the business then you can let your personality come through in your cover letter and at interview.
Your aim in this process is to find out additional information about the role and culture that you can use to enhance your cover letter and CV. What is it, in terms of skills, experience and fit, that they are looking for, beyond what is written on the job advert?
Essentially, any information you can glean from someone within the business is advantageous. From doing this process it will also give you the chance to learn more about the company, people and culture and decide before applying if it is the right job or company for you. You might decide it's not, and therefore have saved yourself a lot of time and effort.
So, although it is polite to address the cover letter to an actual person and the commercial benefits you gain from this process can be significant, if however you can't get the name, then don't worry, you are at no more of a disadvantage than anyone else.

Cognizant has announced the acquisition of Odecee, a provider of digital solutions to enterprises in the Australia and New Zealand region. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Odecee is Cognizant's third acquisition in the last few months.
It had acquired US-based digital marketing agency Cadient in October. In September, the company announced it is acquiring US-based TriZetto Corporation for $2.7 billion in cash. TriZetto provides healthcare IT solutions.
Founded in 2007, Odecee delivers enterprise mobility, Web and cloud solutions to clients in the financial services, insurance, healthcare, logistics, and communications industries.

John Burgin, Regional Head for Australia and New Zealand, Cognizant, said in a press release, “Rapid consumerisation of technology is driving business reinvention across industries and blurring the distinction between the physical and the digital worlds.

Japanese PM may call snap election next month: ReportsJapanese PM may call snap election next month: Reports
PTI
Tweet
Tokyo, Nov 12:  
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could call a snap election for next month, two years early, with a plan to boost his support by delaying another scheduled tax hike, reports said today.
The first jump in sales tax, which came into effect in April, knocked a tentative revival off course and was blamed for a sharp fall in Japan’s second-quarter growth.
Commentators are converging around the idea that Abe will rule out a second rise, from eight per cent to 10, and seek a popular mandate that would help him vanquish mumblings of discontent within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and catch the still-battered Opposition unprepared.
“Calling a snap election within this year is among my options,” Abe told senior party members, the leading business daily Nikkei reported.
The LDP and its junior coalition party Komeito have begun preparations for a vote on either December 14 or 21, four other major national papers said.
The Tokyo Shimbun said Abe had told Komeito managers the election could be held before the year is out.
Abe has been coy in public, telling reporters in Beijing yesterday he had made no decisions, although he admitted to a television interviewer last week: “When asked the question, a prime minister has a set formula: ‘I’m not thinking of a snap election’.’’
Third quarter GDP data
Reports of an election come ahead of the release of third quarter GDP data on Monday, which the government has for a long time said will inform the decision on pressing ahead with the sales tax hike scheduled to take effect in October next year.
The mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun was among media saying today that the rise would be delayed by 18 months to April 2017.
Bank of Japan’s stimulus expansion
Last month’s surprise inflation of the Bank of Japan’s already-huge monetary easing programme, which sent a ripple of excitement through the markets and lit a rocket under stock prices, was also propitious.
The combined effect of this bounce and a feel-good delay in the tax rise would be a boon to Abe if he goes to the voters, and would strengthen his hand for difficult reforms, said Capital Economics in a note.
“A snap election could have the virtue of giving the government a stronger mandate as it struggles to push ahead with structural reform,” it said.
“But it would not be a long-term positive if coupled with a delay in the tax hike currently scheduled for October 2015.”

Women in Business: Andrea Geller  SVP Marketing  OnDeckreddit
Andrea Gellert is the Senior Vice President of Marketing at OnDeck , where she brings more than 15 years of small business marketing and client service experience. Most recently, she was Vice President of Client Services and Operations at Group Commerce, a market-leading e-commerce platform for publishers. Previously, Andrea spent 15 years at American Express, holding leadership positions in both the OPEN small business and Merchant Services divisions. In her most recent position as Vice President of Marketing for OPEN, Andrea spearheaded initiatives that greatly improved the customer experience, as measured by net promoter score and retention rates, and created the company's first small business recognition platform. Andrea graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College and received an MBA from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?
It's so tempting in both large and small companies to want to tackle everything all at once, vs doubling down on the most important business drivers. As someone who has always liked pursuing a variety of interests in both my personal and professional life, learning how to focus and backburner ideas has been a real priority. Although it can be a challenge, I still encourage idea generation so there's always a strong pipeline for the next advances in the business.
It's funny, when I started to get leadership roles years ago, I was told that women apologize too much and men perceive that as weak because they never do. I think there's a balance. I coach people (regardless of gender) that what's most important is demonstrating accountability - accepting responsibility for your actions and moving forward is what shows the most business maturity.
How has your previous employment experience aided your position at OnDeck?
I've been focused on the small business financial services sector for the majority of my career. I joined American Express in what is now OPEN as a summer intern, then spent 15 years there, working my way up in marketing, strategy and account development functions across the OPEN and the Merchant Divisions. Being at a company which has a world class brand and customer experience has definitely informed my approach to marketing at OnDeck.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at OnDeck?
A major highlight was the re-launching of our OnDeck brand. We rolled out a new logo, our new tagline "We actually want to lend to small business", a new visual identity and a new website geared towards our customer - the small business owner. We got incredibly positive feedback from all of our constituents, including employees, investors, and most importantly, customers. It was a great team effort.
In terms of challenges, we have this very ambitious mission to power every small business loan in the country. It's an achievable goal but we're still a young company with limited resources and only 24 hours in a day. Developing a brand takes time, especially with a non-viral product like ours (people generally don't post pictures of their loan on Facebook or Twitter), and so our main challenge is getting all small businesses to know who we are.
What advice can you offer women who are looking for a career in marketing?
Focus on the customer: Marketing is all about showcasing how a product solves a customer need, so find one and go deep on understanding exactly who needs it and why. Spend time with your customers and prospects - they are the ones who will make money for your company and usually have tremendous insights that can help drive whatever part of the business you manage.
Get quantitative: In this day and age marketing is all about data, and so being strong analytically has gone from being important to critical. That means understanding how to structure and read marketing tests as well as how to evaluate and understand all of the components of your marketing channels and sales funnel. There are all kinds of marketing analytics courses out there if this is a development area for you.
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
I've always thought of the notion of work/life balance as a funny way to think about it - I think you've got one life and you have to decide how you are going to live it. I'm a wife, mother of two children, a career person and someone with my own personal interests - and I aim for fulfillment across all those areas.  As a family we've made some decisions to help us stay involved - so we live in Manhattan where work, school and home are close by; and I have a very supportive husband who's active in sharing household and parenting responsibilities.
It's always been important to me that my place of work respects the flexibility that working parents need, so I've sought out companies like American Express and now OnDeck. One of the benefits of working in FinTech is that the offices are very tech-enabled - it's easy to work from home if you have to, or check in via a variety of devices.
What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?
Confidence. Over and over what I observe is that women are often far more capable than they give themselves credit for. So they hold back, which is not a great recipe for success in the modern workplace.
I think there is a lot of opportunity for women in the workplace. Women make up more than half of the professional workforce, and are more active on social media than men, but the tech industry is predominantly comprised of men. It's very easy for a woman to feel like an outsider in the tech industry, but we are starting to stake our claim in the space, and it's very exciting.
I've been fortunate enough to work at companies that don't have preconceived norms of gender. American Express has a lot of women, especially in senior leadership positions. When I first started at OnDeck, I was the only senior woman at the company and in general there weren't that many women here at all. But the team here has always been far more interested in how to solve problems and disrupt traditional financial services methods than what your gender is, which creates a tremendously stimulating environment. And since joining OnDeck, we've hired several women at all levels and are starting to close the gender gap.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
Mentorship has helped me become a better leader. I've had the good fortune of having several great bosses who have taught me a lot about how to lead, both by their example and by their guidance. A great boss is someone who not only inspires you to be better but is also willing to point out your blind spots and help you more effectively manage around them.
We started a women's group at OnDeck called Women@OnDeck with this in mind. We're encouraging women of all levels at the company to get to know each other better, and for the more senior women to share their experiences and lessons learned to the younger, more junior women, in hopes that it will help them grow and succeed in the workplace.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
I had the fortunate opportunity to see Gloria Steinem speak at a women's luncheon, and she said something that really stuck out to me. She gave an anecdote about someone asking who she's going to pass the torch to, and her immediate response was "What a male oriented question! I'm not giving up my torch - I'm using my torch to light other womens' torches." That idea that it's not a zero sum game, that we can all be successful, is something that Steinhem has always championed and has stayed relevant.  And, I have to admit, who doesn't want to be that fabulous at 80!
I'm also very impressed with Dr Maria Klawe, the President of Harvey Mudd College. 40% of computer science majors there are now women due to her efforts. And she's done it by spending time understanding and addressing root cause issues. Simple things, like creating a special introductory computer science class for people with no prior coding experience, ensuring there are female instructors and the like have made the field far more accessible and so more women are entering it.
What do you want OnDeck to accomplish in the next year?
OnDeck's vision is to transform how money flows to Main Street by leveraging our platform to enable all types of investors to make capital on demand a reality for small business owners. Think of how Priceline transformed travel, or Zillow has transformed home buying - we believe small business financing can be ongoing and friction-free.
We're excited to continue to bring new products to market for our customers and really be a partner to small business throughout their entire lifecycle.

The best (and worst) of the Concert for ValorBy Dan Lamothe November 12 Follow @danlamothe
HBO hosted a star-studded event at the National Mall in celebration of Veterans Day on Tuesday featuring Rihanna, Eminem, Carrie Underwood, Bruce Springsteen and Metallica. (Tom Johnson and Ashleigh Joplin/HBO)
It wasn’t clear who would headline the Concert for Valor when it began. Would it be Bruce Springsteen, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 and has lent his celebrity to veterans charities for years? Would it be Metallica, the heavy metal heroes whose music has resonated with this generation of American service member?
But rapper Eminem took the honors, fresh off the release of a freestyle in which he suggests he’ll punch singer Lana Del Ray “ in the face twice like Ray Rice .” That already was controversial, but then Shady added fuel to the fire with his salute from the stage to those who have served.
“Happy motherf—ing Veterans Day,” he said — and then Twitter exploded.
Ear muffs! #Eminem giving families on the mall some explaining to do. #ConcertForValor #VeteransDay
— Heath Druzin (@Druzin_Stripes) November 12, 2014
Would it be too much to ask for @Eminem not to drop so many f-bombs on the National Mall at the #ConcertForValor ?
— Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) November 12, 2014
Just for reference – to those shocked to hear @Eminem swearing at #ConcertForValor … way less than you'll hear during a military watch.

A loud, profane & awesome bridge across the civ-mil divide: @Eminem : "Happy Motherf$&king #Veterans Day!" http://t.co/cKY917Pi67
— Phillip Carter (@inteldump) November 12, 2014
Never mind that the foul-mouthed salute was greeted by plenty of cheers. Or that Eminem swearing is about as common as a 19-year-old lance corporal standing watch somewhere. The faux-controversy erupted anyway, and was one of the worst things about the show.
Here are some of the other best (and worst) things that happened, as seen by Checkpoint. I was standing among the crowd off of 4th and Independence streets, with a lot of veterans.

Metallica brings dozens of veterans on stage for performance
Anyone doubting whether Metallica would have its heart in the concert was quickly answered. The band came out with a thunderous performance of “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” and had dozens of veterans on stage during the performance.
The band followed with two more classics, “Master of Puppets” and “Enter Sandman.” In between, frontman James Hetfield offered this: “We finally get to play for our heroes.”
Man, I wasn't upset I'm not at the #ConcertForValor . And then Metallica started their set. I'm watching on HBO, and it looks electric.

Anti-war music at a show for valor
One of the biggest surprises of the night was Dave Grohl, Zac Brown and Springsteen combining to perform Creedence Clearwater Revival’s 1969 hit, “Fortunate Son.” Written during the Vietnam War, it’s a raucous takedown of blind patriotism, class warfare and those who are quick to send troops to war without going themselves.
The song was greeted with energy by much of the crowd, as this video shot on site shows:
But the third verse in particular — in which Springsteen sings that he “ain’t no military son,” is taking heat. Some questioned whether it was the appropriate choice, as my Washington Post colleague Justin Moyer already noted . Reactions are mixed:
@foxandfriends Choosing to sing Fortunate Son at #ConcertForValor shows how little the elite musicians understand veterans, valor, & honor.
— Dave Chitwood (@davechitwood) November 12, 2014
Yeah, dummies, they played “Fortunate Son” at the #ConcertForValor . It’s pro-soldier & anti-chickenhawk. As usual, outrage over nothing. — Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) November 12, 2014
Springsteen’s performance got additional scrutiny because he not only played his 1984 mega-hit “Born in the U.S.A.,” but stripped it down into an bluesy, acoustic version that highlighted its dark lyrics. Decades after its release, casual fans still confuse it with being an upbeat patriotic sing-along. But it actually includes lines like “I had a brother at Khe Sanh fighting off the Viet Cong / They’re still there, he’s all gone.”
Reaction, again, was mixed:
Acoustic Bruce gives me the chills. Epic performance. Makes me proud to be another Jersey boy born in the U.S.A #ConcertForValor

@HBO how on earth did you book springsteen for this? i never knew he was political in any way. must be his first charity show — dan (@denialtwister31) November 9, 2014
As noted previously, Springsteen has been involved in veterans charities for years.
The Black Keys not mentioning the reason they were there
The Black Keys took the stage relatively early in the concert, playing hits “Howlin’ for You,” “Fever” and “Lonely Boy.” Notably missing, however: Not once did they give the veterans and active-duty troops present a shout-out. Wasn’t that half the point?
To be fair, though, their performance was popular:

The Singing Sergeants Choir joins @CarrieUnderwood to perform “Something in the Water.” http://t.co/Nf1n5ki03o
— HBO (@HBO) November 12, 2014
Country star Carrie Underwood’s performance turned into a sing-along for many, especially during her hit “Before He Cheats.” But it was another song of hers — “Something in the Water” — that gave the Air Force’s chorus, the Singing Sergeants, a chance to shine.
The group is based at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, and includes 23 musicians, Air Force officials say .
Reaction to videos of inspiring vets
In between performances, the crowd — and viewers on HBO at home — were shown videos of inspiring veterans who are profiled in the new book “For Love of Country,” by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and Washington Post journalist Rajiv Chandrasekaran.
Several of them, including Medal of Honor recipient Leroy Petry, were greeted with a warm ovation when it was revealed to the crowd they were in attendance. Petroy, who lost his right hand while throwing an enemy hand grenade away from two fellow soldiers, appeared to get emotional at the response.

Posco to invest 20 million USD in Gujarat: South KoreanAmbassadorPrint
Written by Avinash Nair | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:41 pm
One of the world’s biggest steel manufacturer – Posco- is expected to be the first major South Korean investor in Gujarat. According to the Ambassador of the Republic of South Korea, Joongyu Lee, the company has firmed up plans to invest 20 million USD or (Rs 123 crore) in the state.
“Posco has decided to invest 20 million USD in building a steel coil mill in Gujarat,” said Lee while talking to mediapersons during his visit to the city here on Wednesday. Lee is leading a 60-member delegation from South Korea which includes representatives from the Posco Group.
The South Korean steel giant already holds about 26 percent equity in Posco Poggenamp Electrical Steel Pvt Ltd that has operations in Gujarat.
“South Korean investment in Gujarat is minimal and so we are here to explore opportunities,” said Lee while stating how his country’s presence is limited to a couple of companies in the power sector.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Ambassador met Gujarat chief  minister Anandiben Patel at Gandhinagar. Later, a round-table meeting between Korean corporate executives and state government officials were also held. “The Gujarat government has proposed to build a exclusive zone for Korean companies in Gujarat. However, this is just at an ideation stage,” said Lee while simultaneously stating how South Koreans were concentrating more on the upcoming Korean industrial park at Neemrana in Rajasthan.
“The meeting with Gujarat government officials were more an exchange of ideas. However, companies like Samsung and LG are keen to explore opportunities in the state,” Lee added.
In the evening the South Korean Ambassador addressed the Korea-Gujarat friendship forum held at Ahmedabad where he traced back Korean and Indian bilateral ties to a 2000 year-old-incident where according to Lee an Indian princess from Ayodhya, travelled all the way to Korea and married a Korean King. Lee said that one-fourth of the population of Korea including him, were descendants of this Korean-Indian couple.
Recollecting his meeting with Narendra Modi who was at the helm of affairs in Gujarat last year, Lee said that he was right in choosing a state which has been a proved to be a “nursery” for the political career of Modi who has gone on to become the Prime Minister of the country.
According to him the size of bilateral trade between India and Korea stood at 17 billion USD and more than 450 Korean companies had invested 3.5 billion USD in India.
SEZ of Gujarat and the DMIC corridor in Gujarat presents a lot of potential for future Korean investments in the state, Lee said while addressing businessmen from the state at the forum.  This could be in the areas of automobiles, infrastructure, petrochemicals, renewable energy, shipbuilding, textiles and tourism, he added.
B2B networking session hosted by Korea International Trade Association and a meeting of Small and medium companies hosted by Korea Trade-Investment Promotion agency was hosted at two different hotels in the city. Top leaders of the companies like Hyundai Motors, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Posco India, Doosan Power System India, Hyosung, Hyundai Construction, Nuga Medical India, continued…

US urges IMF to cancel some debt of Ebola-hitcountriesTreasury Secretary Jack Lew will propose the debt relief program for Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea
By: Agence-France Presse | Washington | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:31 pm
The United States has asked the International Monetary Fund to cancel USD 100 million of the debts of the three West African countries devastated by the Ebola outbreak.
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will propose the debt relief program for Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea at this week’s G20 meeting in Brisbane, according to a statement on Wednesday.
“The International Monetary Fund has already played a critical role as a first responder, providing economic support to countries hardest hit by Ebola,” Lew said.
“Today we are asking the IMF to expand that support by providing debt relief for Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. IMF debt relief will promote economic sustainability in the worst hit countries by freeing up resources for both immediate needs and longer-term recovery efforts,” he added.
Commercial, industrial and agricultural activities have stalled in the three poor countries in the face of the epidemic, which has killed around 5,000, according to the World Health Organisation.
“These economic impacts will likely increase and continue until confidence rebounds, underpinning the need to free up resources to contain Ebola, to support vulnerable communities and critical government services, and to restore economic growth,” the US Treasury said.
Lew’s proposal is to tap into the IMF’s Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust (PCDR) used to fully cancel Haiti’s USD 268 million debt to the IMF in the wake of the 2010 earthquake catastrophe on the Caribbean island.
The Treasury pointed out that the PCDR still has USD 150 million, two-thirds of which it proposed could be put toward debt relief for the three West African countries.

Why some people just cant dance or clap to the beat(Courtesy of Lionsgate Home Entertainment)
Some people just can't seem to keep a beat.
You know the ones: They seem to be swaying to their own music or clapping along to a beat only they can hear. You may even think that describes you.
A group of evolutionary biologists say they have figured out exactly which dance movements catch a woman's eye. Here's there simulation of the moves women rated best. (Northumbria University)
The majority of humans, however, do this very well. We clap, dance, march in unison with few problems; that ability is part of what sets us apart from other animals.
But it is true that rhythm — specifically, coordinating your movement with something you hear — doesn't come naturally to some people. Those people represent a very small sliver of the population and have a real disorder called "beat deafness."
A group of evolutionary biologists say they have figured out exactly which dance movements catch a woman's eye. Here's there simulation of the moves women rated worst. (Northumbria University)
Unfortunately, your difficulty dancing or keeping time in band class probably doesn't quite qualify.
A new study by McGill University researchers looked more closely at what might be going on with "beat deaf" individuals, and the findings may shed light on why some people seem to be rhythm masters while others struggle.
Truly beat deaf people have a very difficult time clapping or tapping to an auditory beat or swaying to one. It's a problem that is far more severe than a lack of coordination. And it isn't attributable to motor skills, hearing problems or even a person's inability to create a regular rhythm.
[From the archive: Scientists have discovered the exact dance movements that catch a woman’s eye]
Illustrating how rare the disorder really is, McGill scientists received hundreds of inquiries from people who thought they were beat deaf, but only two qualified as having truly severe problems.
Those two people — a man named Mathieu and a woman named Marjorie — were compared to a large group of 32 people who represented the general population. Among the 32 people in the "control" group, some were better than others at matching a beat.
"The range in the general population is pretty wide, but not too wide because they're really doing quite wonderfully," said Caroline Palmer, a professor of psychology at McMcGill and the lead author of the study. "If you presented with a five percent change in the rate of the metronome, the great majority in the general population will hear it and respond to it. People are pretty adept at it."
In the lab, Palmer wanted to get a baseline estimate of Mathieu's and Marjorie's beat-matching abilities. Both were able to tap their fingers to their own beat with no music, just like the control group.
"The beat deaf individuals do not differ in terms of sensing the beat and they don't differ in terms of being able to feel a beat," Palmer said. "They can clap or tap regularly when there's no sound. It's only when they attempt to synchronize that they stick out."
The beat deaf participants were put to the test when they were asked to tap to a metronome whose beat became faster or slower throughout the exercise. For most people, the sudden change in tempo would cause them to adjust their tapping — first by perhaps overshooting the beat, then undershooting it, before finally settling in on the correct tempo.
The two beat deaf individuals couldn't do that.
Both Mathieu and Marjorie were far worse at settling in on the metronome's new beat compared to the control group.
"They are too far away from the beat and they stay far away from the beat," Palmer said.
Mathieu had some musical training and Marjorie had none, but the findings weren't explained by their musical ability or lack thereof.
To understand why, you have to consider the basic principles of how humans understand rhythms.
Scientists believe that many basic biological functions — like our heartbeat, walking, and even talking — operate based on rhythms controlled by an internal oscillating function. Think of it as traveling over a cyclic pattern of peaks and valleys on a mountain.
One theory suggests that this is how humans understand the passage of time — you have a sense of how much time has passed based on where you are in the cycle. Humans can synchronize their rhythmic activities, like the pace of walking or jogging, to a beat by adapting their internal oscillators to the rate of "highs and lows" in things like music.
Palmer's research suggest that both Mathieu's and Marjorie's internal oscillators function abnormally.
"What we found is that the oscillators were not adapting correctly to the change in the metronome rate," she said.
One of the beat deaf individuals had an oscillator that was running at a completely different frequency than the general population. In the second beat deaf individual, their oscillator didn't have the "dampen" function, which allows it to settle into the pulse in the music.
"Think of it as you get thrown out of whack, you overshoot the tempo or you undershoot it, then you settle in on the tempo," Palmer explained. "This person never settled in, they kept overshooting or undershooting."
To further test the "oscillator" theory, Palmer was able to create a computer model that mimicked the pattern of the unique internal oscillators of the beat deaf people.
When they put the computer model of Mathieu and Marjorie's oscillators to the same metronome test — where it needed to adjust to the speeding up or slowing down of the tempo — it accurately predicted the rate of error that Palmer had observed between the two beat deaf individuals and the control group.
That suggests that the oscillator theory explains why some people have serious trouble moving to a beat — something that most other humans can do very easily.
The study, which was published this week in the journal Philosophical Transaction: Biological Sciences , adds to a body of research about how humans' internal timing mechanisms work to control much of what we do — for example, the circadian rhythms that influence sleep and wake cycles.
It is still unknown, however, whether beat deaf individuals also have problems with adapting to rhythms in conversational speech, for example, or visual cues.

Jayalalithaa disqualified for 10 years: TN issuesnotificationBy: Press Trust of India | Chennai | Posted: November 12, 2014 10:25 pm
AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa is disqualified from contesting elections for ten years, the Tamil Nadu government has said in a gazette notification.
“Consequent upon the conviction of Selvi J Jayalalithaa, Member of the Legislative Assembly, she stands disqualified for being a Member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly from the date of conviction, i.e., the 27th day of September, 2014 for the period of her sentence (four years),” the gazette notification dated November 8 read. It was issued by Speaker of the Tamil Nadu Assembly P Dhanapal.
It also said that she “shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since her release in terms of the existing Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.”
The notification also said that Srirangam Assembly Constituency, represented by Jayalalithaa “shall be deemed to have become vacant from the date of her conviction,” September 27.
Although media was given to understand on November 9 that a notification declaring Srirangam seat as vacant was issued, only on Wednesday it has been officially released by the Tamil Nadu state government.
Also, the details pertaining to disqualification has become known only on Wednesday.
Jayalalithaa was convicted and sentenced to four years in jail besides a fine of Rs 100 crore in a 18-year-old disproportionate assets case by a special court in Bangalore. She was released from jail in Bangalore on October 17 as per the Supreme Court order granting her bail in the case.

After appeal  India wants unconditional release offishermenPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 10:25 pm
A day after it filed an appeal against the Sri Lankan high court verdict giving death sentence to five Indian fishermen, India on Wednesday said it wants “immediate and unconditional” release of its nationals.
India’s reaction assumes significance in the backdrop of the reported statement by Sri Lankan Minister Prabha Ganesan that President Mahinda Rajapaksa was ready to pardon the fishermen on death row for alleged drug smuggling if the Indian High Commission in Colombo does not proceed with an appeal against the sentence.
“The government has always been insisting on the immediate and unconditional release of its fishermen who been sentenced to death the Lankan court. And any avenue which enables that will be pursued,” government sources told PTI, indicating that it will not take back the appeal.
India, on Wednesday, filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka against a verdict of the high court awarding death sentence to the five fishermen for alleged drug smuggling.
Emerson, P Augustus, R Wilson, K Prasath and J Langlet, all hailing from Tamil Nadu, were apprehended in 2011 and were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court on October 30.
Earlier this week,    External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin had said the government would do everything
possible to ensure return of the Indian fishermen in accordance with Sri Lanka’s legal and executive process.
“It is a matter on which we place very high priority. It is also a matter on which we are exploring a variety of avenues to ensure that those citizens of India return to India safely. These avenues are being pursued in accordance with Sri Lanka’s legal system and Sri Lanka’s executive role in the process,” he had said.
The court ruling had triggered fiery protests in parts of Tamil Nadu and sporadic violence broke out in and around Rameswaram island as a large number of people staged protests.
The issue of fishermen is very emotive for both Sri Lanka and India, where Tamil Nadu-based parties including AIADMK and DMK have been regularly pressing the government to take up the matter with the Lankan authorities seriously and have often resented high-profile visits from the island nation.
Earlier, in the week, there were also reports originating from Colombo that Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken to each other on the issue. However, there was no official confirmation on it from the Indian side.

President Barack Obama meets PM Modi; calls him a man ofactionPrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President BArack Obama met each other for the second time in six weeks.
By: Press Trust of India | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 12, 2014 10:05 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 8:53 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a brief interaction here Wednesday night with Barack Obama during which the US President called him a “man of action”.
Modi and Obama met each other for the second time in six weeks at a Gala Dinner in Myanmar capital after the President played host to the Prime Minister at the White house in Washington in the last week of September.
“Prez Obama greets PM @narendramodi at Gala dinner – ‘You are a man of action!,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin tweeted after the dinner.
The dinner was hosted by Myanmar President Thein Sein for world leaders attending the ASEAN and the East Asian summits.
On the eve of their summit talks, Obama had hosted a rare private dinner for Modi at the White House on September 29.
Modi was welcomed by Obama who greeted him in Gujarati, “Kem Chho?” (how are you?), the mother tongue of the Prime Minister.
Set in an informal ambience, the dinner was the first opportunity for both the leaders to interact with each other.

European spacecraft lands oncometPrint
By: Associated Press | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:55 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 8:28 am
The European Space Agency says it has succeeded in landing a spacecraft on a comet for the first time in history.
The agency says it has received a signal from the 100-kilogram (220-pound) Philae lander after it touched down on the icy surface of the comet named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Flight director Andrea Accomazzo says “we definitely confirm that the lander is on the surface.”
Further checks are needed to ascertain the state of the lander.
The landing on the speeding comet marks the highlight of the decade-long Rosetta mission to study comets and learn more about the origins of these celestial bodies.

Aldermen approve SRO preservation law10
Displaced tenants who lived in a building for at least 32 consecutive days would receive $2,000 to $8,600 in one-time relocation assistance, depending on the circumstances. A tenant who has to move because of unsafe building conditions would be entitled to $10,600 in relocation assistance.
The law also includes restrictions mandating how many units are reserved for people of different financial means.
Building owners do not consider the law much of a compromise.
"The numbers simply don't work. Over time, it could be catastrophic," said Eric Rubenstein, an owner of three SROs and executive director of the Single Room Housing Assistance Corp., which represents 75 properties.
The final version of the ordinance, however, offers more options for owners than earlier drafts and was repeatedly called a compromise during Wednesday's council meeting. The law does not apply to building owners who had sought city permits before June 25 for demolition or conversion to market-rate housing.
The tweaked proposal also gives owners a year to formally close on the sale of a building. Also, the proposal more specifically states that preservation fees collected under the ordinance could be tapped to offer forgivable loans and other potential financing sources to rehab existing SROs or grants to prospective buyers who want to maintain the buildings as affordable housing.
Housing advocates estimate that Chicago has lost more than 2,200 rooms of housing for very low- and low-income residents during the past three years.
In July, the Chicago City Council passed a six-month moratorium on the issuance of any building permits tied to the conversion or demolition of SRO buildings while aldermen devised rules governing redevelopment of the buildings.
"Some of the pushback that we get around the city, including in my ward, about affordable housing, people generally just don't like the idea of government-subsidized housing, and I think that conversation is fundamentally flawed," said Ald. Ameya Pawar, 47th.
"If you own a home, you get a mortgage tax deduction. That is a government subsidy."

MapQuest users plug-in to roadside assistance with Urgent.ly app, which lets you track the location of help.
Like Uber and taxis, Urgent.ly roadside assistance app competes with traditional help from AAA and others.
Need roadside help? Use a new app to find and track the nearest repair center.
WASHINGTON — Urgent.ly, an online mobile application that allows stranded drivers to summon car repair help, is partnering with MapQuest in a deal that aims to disrupt the $10 billion roadside assistance industry much as Uber has done to the taxi and car service business.
The alliance, announced Nov. 11, allows MapQuest users to use Urgent.ly to summon help to repair a flat tire, fix a dead battery or get the vehicle towed.
Whether you are a new, young driver or someone who has never owned a car before, learning the basics of car care makes both driving and ownership more fun. Even veteran car owners should be familiar with the basics. ( Bob Weber, Special to the Tribune )
Both companies are based in Dulles, Virginia. MapQuest is an AOL property and Urgent.ly is a start-up founded in 2013 and run by several former AOL executives.
"MapQuest is one of the premiere mapping services in the U.S., and has more than 40 million users nationwide. Integrating with MapQuest allows Urgent.ly to scale quickly by providing our innovative on-demand roadside assistance service to their millions of users across the country," said Urgent.ly chief executive Chris Spanos, who once was general manager for AOL's local business.
0
The service will work this way: After receiving vehicle information and a description of the problem from a MapQuest user, Urgent.ly zeroes in on the driver's location and connects the stranded motorist to a nearby service provider. Users can track the service provider's progress on a map, along with its estimated time of arrival. The MapQuest customer then pays for the service on site with a credit card.
MapQuest's 44.4 million users will now be able to tap a "roadside assistance" button on the MapQuest menu bar, connecting them to Urgent.ly without going through a separate application.
"Using Urgent.ly and its upfront, flat-rate pricing, you will have an estimate on cost and answers to where and when the assistance will arrive." - Urgent.ly chief executive Chris Spanos
Urgent.ly and its new partner said they are aiming to tap into the 200 million drivers on U.S. roads who experience 100 million roadside "events" per year. The American Automobile Association, which has 53 million members, services 29 million calls for service per year.
Urgent.ly estimated there are roughly 30 million potential roadside customers who currently search online through a mobile phone to find help, according to Spanos.
"The whole thing now is if you search on your phone, and you find Joe's Towing listed, you have no idea if he is near you, open, available, capable and how much he is going to charge," Spanos said. "Using Urgent.ly and its upfront, flat-rate pricing, you will have an estimate on cost and answers to where and when the assistance will arrive."
Prior to launching Urgent.ly, Spanos, 45, founded SeniorChecked, a network of pre-screened local businesses for seniors and their families. SeniorChecked was acquired in 2011 by NEWAsurion, a company that provides insurance and services for mobile phones and other products.
Urgent.ly received $525,000 in March from BluVentures and CIT GAP Funds, which is Virginia's technology fund. Urgent.ly has been live in Washington for several months, testing its service among several thousand users.

Speed up action on financial sector regulation: PMO to Economic Affairs DeptIrked by delay in action on FSLRC recommendations made in 2013
New Delhi, November 12:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants speedy implementation of recommendations given by Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) submitted on March 22, 2013.
This will expedite measures such as implementing new monetary policy framework agreement and merger of Forward Market Commission with Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) among others.
Senior Government officials said that a communication has been sent from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to the Economic Affairs Department of the Finance Ministry.
“The communication expressed concern about the delay of over 18 months and mentioned desire of the Prime Minister for quick action,” another official told BusinessLine.
The Commission has recommended revamping the legislative framework governing the financial sector by a non-sectoral, principle-based approach, and restructuring existing regulatory agencies as well as creating new agencies wherever needed.
It has also suggested a draft legislation – Indian Financial Code.
The basic approach of the commission is to provide clear mandate, powers and mechanism for accountability to financial agencies.
The FSLRC has recommended seven agency structures for the financial sector – the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Unified Financial Agency (UFA), Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal (FSAT), Resolution Corporation (RC), Financial Redressal Agency (FRA), Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) and Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA). 
The tasks or mandate are consumer protection, prudential regulation, resolution mechanism, capital controls, systematic risk, financial inclusion and market development, and monetary policy which need to be addressed in a non-sectoral manner.
Two parts
The recommendations of the commission can be divided into two parts – legislative and non-legislative aspects.
On its part the Finance Ministry is finalising one of the non-legislative measures – new Monetary Policy Framework Agreement with the RBI. The proposed framework is based on recommendations given by the Commission and the Urjit Patel Committee, with some inputs from Raghuram Rajan Committee on Financial Sector Reforms.
It aims to change the formulation of monetary policy and will also focus on inflation targeting.
A Finance Ministry official said the effort is to sign the new agreement by February 1, 2015. However, the RBI will take a call on the date of implementation.

Govt under pressure to set higher price for deepsea gas findsGovt under pressure to set higher price for deepsea gas finds
Richa Mishra
New uniform price will make investments unviable, feels industry
New Delhi, November 12:  
Less than a fortnight after the Government announced a new price for domestically produced gas, the pressure is mounting on it to consider higher prices for deepwater discoveries which are yet to come into production.
Sources in the know said that a view is emerging within the BJP and sections of the Government to consider the demands of industry, which says that the new uniform price of $5.05 a unit (gas is measured in million British thermal units) makes their deepsea investments unviable.
“An area of focus for the BJP has been to bring in investments in the sector. We know that deepwater requires specialised technology and higher input costs. If the requirement is for having differential pricing, then it should be considered,” said Narendra Taneja, National Convener - Energy Cell, BJP.
If the Government does consider the request, it will benefit not only private sector players like Reliance Industries but also public sector entities such as ONGC and GSPC. An industry official said even in the neighbourhood Myanmar, the well head price for deepwater is $7.5 a unit. Higher price is also required to attract foreign investment when the Government launches tenth edition of oil and gas blocks auctions.
In fact, Association of Oil & Gas Operators, in its submission before the Government had sought free market pricing for gas. It had been maintaining that any move away from free market pricing will be a violation of the production sharing contract and its sanctity.
A fresh debate is also emerging on whether there should be a differential pricing – separate price for deepwater discoveries and shallow/onshore discoveries. A section of industry feels that uniform pricing is the solution but it should be market linked.
In fact, when announcing the new price, to be effective from November 1, 2014 till March 31, 2015, the Government had said that Reliance Industries and its foreign partners in KG-D6 block will not get the benefit of the new price for D1, D3 discoveries till the ongoing arbitration with the Government is resolved.
Besides, the existing deepwater discoveries will also not qualify for premium on gas price. The Government has proposed a premium for deepwater/ultra-deepwater discoveries. But, this will be only for discoveries made after November 1.

25% of the global workforce in 2020 tipped to be Indians
Mumbai, November 12:  
Australia and India have decided to map common standards on job roles and further strengthen bilateral cooperation on skill development. The Indian Government has also decided to expand the capacities of 12,000 industrial training institutes.
At the ‘3rd India Australia Skills Conference: Skills for Better Business’ in Mumbai on Wednesday, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the National Skill Development Corporation, India (NSDC) and TAFE Directors, Australia, on Technical and Vocational Education and Training cooperation. The purpose is to further strengthen cooperation between the two to enhance and extend bilateral cooperation between Australia and India, a statement noted. The aim is to contribute positively to the development of technical and vocational education and training related linkages between India and Australia, it added.
Better training
Bandaru Dattatreya, Minister for Labour and Employment, was present at the signing. In a statement, he said that with India going to add 10 million people to the work force each year, for the next 15 years, they would all need to be skilled and employed.
He informed the ministry had launched a scheme for flexi memorandum of understandings between industry and industrial training institutes, which would lead to a minimum of 80 per cent of placement in the industry.
Around three years ago, the India-Australia engagement on skills development had made an initial foray. The project has made rapid progress. It may be recalled that during the visit of the Indian delegation to Australia in July 2014, five sectors were identified and one or more critical job roles were taken up for developing the Indo-Australian Trans National Standards.
These job roles are facing a shortage of skilled manpower in Australia. Indian candidates, when trained and certified to these Trans National Standards, would be available to cover the skills shortage in Australia. Ian McFarlane, Minister for Industry, Australia noted that an exchange of mutually beneficial standards in the skills landscape was bound to build strong resources for both countries.
Indian workforce
In a statement, he pointed out that by 2020, 25 per cent of the total international manpower employed would be Indian, and hence it is the most opportune time to bring vocational training in India to an international standard for higher mobility.
Dilip Chenoy, CEO of NSDC said, “In three months, Indian automotive, IT, telecom, retail and healthcare sectors, in collaboration with their Australian counterparts, have already completed preliminary mapping of the Standards. A final draft of completely mapped standards, with resultant identified gaps, would be available by end of December 2014.” Steps have also been initiated for collaborative efforts between Indian and Australian training providers in order to offer higher quality training delivery and ‘Train the Trainer’ modules.
Successful candidates would then be available to take up employment in Australia or other territories such as West Asia, where Australian standards are accepted, the statement added.

Trinidad and Tobago Central Bank Governor invokes the epic for better governance
Mumbai, November 12:  
Not everyday does a central banker, especially one from the Caribbean islands, draw analogies from an Indian epic to illustrate the work done by his organisation.
Recently, the Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, Jwala Rambarran, moved away from open market operations and Basel-III norms, to draw on the Ramayana and the lessons it holds for bankers.
Addressing bankers at the Port of Spain, Rambarran narrated five stories from the epic to make his point.
Duty-bound
The first story was of Shravan Kumar, who epitomises a dutiful son devoted to his old, blind parents. The learning: Over the last 50 years, the T&T Central Bank has been at the centre of three financial crises, but as a dutiful institution it has borne this burden with fortitude and will strive to protect the financial system for the next 50 years.
Rambarran then narrated the second story of Dasarath who, bound by his word, reluctantly orders his eldest son, Rama, into exile for 14 years and unable to bear the pain of separation, dies. Like Dasarath, a central bank is duty bound to take difficult, but right, actions to ensure people’s savings, pensions, insurance policies and hard-earned money are not at risk.
The third example he cited was of Bharat ruling Ayodhya as Rama’s agent for 14 years. Like the devoted brother, the central bank uses its power, drawn from the people, for public good and ensuring financial stability.
The fourth was the story of Lakshman, who accompanied Rama to the forest. The Lakshman Rekha drawn by him to protect Sita should be seen as the financial regulation by a central bank. Only within the Lakshman Rekha do citizens have financial protection.
Skill development
The fifth, and final, story was about Luv and Kush. Trained by Sage Valmiki, the two were masters in archery and other disciplines.
The T&T Central Bank, he said, was developing skills in areas such as anti-money laundering, actuarial science and cyber security.
It was also picking skills in strategic communications, international relations and behavioural psychology. A decade ago, these skill-sets were nowhere on the radar of the Central Bank.
The new breed of central bankers, according to Rambarran, must ask the right questions and have the courage to look beyond the obvious and take on, like Rama's army, the too-big-to-fail entities.

These Stores Are Closed on Thanksgiving. Here s Why.Family trumps profits at these stores closed on Thanksgiving
Ben Popken TODAY

Jonathan Alcorn / Reuters
A crowd of shoppers browse at Target on the Thanksgiving Day holiday in Burbank, California November 22, 2012.
If you think Thanksgiving is for family, not shopping, these stores agree.
Even though it means missing an opportunity to gain sales, dozens of retailers are again taking a stand and keeping their doors shut to give their workers a break and their reputations a boost.
They're pushing back against "Black Friday creep," in which the historic kickstart to the holiday shopping and deal season has been getting earlier and earlier until stores started opening on Thursday.
According to a National Retail Federation survey, of those consumers who have or will go shopping during the Thanksgiving holiday times, 31.8 percent said they planned to go shopping on Thursday.
But they won't be showing up at any of these stores. The growing list of retailers staying shut on Thanksgiving this year includes American Girl, Barnes & Noble, Bed, Bath and Beyond, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Burlington Coat Factory, Costco, Crate & Barrel, Dillard’s, DSW, GameStop, Hobby Lobby, HomeGoods, Home Depot, Jo Ann Fabrics, Lowe’s, Marshalls, Nordstrom, Patagonia, Petco, Pier 1, Publix, REI, Sam’s Club, Sur La Table, Talbots, T.J. Maxx, and Von Maur Department Stores.
Last year, home improvement chain Menard's took out full-page ads just to advertise that they'll be closed on Thanksgiving.
Video: Sears, Macy’s and Kmart and announced last year they they would be opening their doors on Thanksgiving day. NBC News’ Stephanie Gosk filed this report in 2013.
Retailers who do keep the doors shuttered say they're recognizing the value of family.
"First, we want our associates to have that time to spend with family," said Tara Raddohl, a Sam's Club spokeswoman, "Second, our members have told us they want that day to spend with their loved ones."
It's so against the trend that one chain had to start sending out press releases just to deal with the influx of media attention they received for not opening on Thanksgiving.
“Some of life’s most cherished traditions begin with family and friends. As a family-owned business since 1872, we value most the opportunity to spend quality time with loved ones on Thanksgiving and other holidays,” said Jim von Maur, president of Von Maur, an Iowa-based department store chain with 30 stores in 14 states, in the press release.
"The exceptional service and character our associates display day in and day out has been shaped by the likes of their parents, grandparents and friends," he said. "Giving them the opportunity to spend the holidays with those who have made such a lasting impact on their lives is a tradition we’ll never break."
Melody Wright, the store's Chief Operating Officer, questions whether stores that open on Thanksgiving are even making any more money.
"Most consumers say I have to spend X dollars and this is where I'm going to get it," she said. That amount is going to be the same whether it's spent on Thanksgiving, or four days before Christmas, she said.
A tiny camera hidden at the front door of over 1,000 retailers to count who comes and goes agrees. Last year, data from these ShopperTrak devices showed there was about the same number of shoppers going into stores on Thanksgiving as a normal Thursday in November, said company founder Bill Martin.
"They're getting sales on Thursday at the sacrifice of Friday, Saturday or Sunday," said Martin.
Because of the deals they have to offer to induce shoppers and because of overhead costs, "they're not making a lot of money as a result," he said.
Despite this, many stores, fearful that customers' wallets will be emptied by another store opening for Black Friday before they do, have continued an opening-hours arms race that accelerated during the recent economic downturn.
Target, Macy's, Kohl's, Sears and other retailers have announced opening hours of 6 p.m. J.C. Penney has tried to beat them all by opening at 5 p.m. This week, beleaguered electronics store RadioShack said they'll be opening at 8 a.m.
Their shoppers won't be visiting any of Von Maur's stores the same day. That's fine by Wright.
"If that means we make less profit on that particular day, we're willing to live with that," she said. "We've never been tempted that you would sacrifice the importance of family and holiday tradition and try to convince yourself that it will be more profitable."

U. of C.'s Booth now No. 3 and Harvard Business drops out of the top 5, for those keeping score.
The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business has fallen out of the top spot on the Bloomberg Businessweek rankings of MBA programs, the publication said Tuesday.
Booth, which fell to No. 3, had been No. 1 for the past four rankings. This is the 14th time Bloomberg Businessweek ranked 112 full-time MBA programs worldwide. The rankings, which come out every other year, aim to capture which business schools "offer the strongest education and best prepare MBAs for their careers," it said.
Duke's Fuqua School Jumps to Number One
Duke University's Fuqua School of Business based in Durham, North Carolina, took the No. 1 spot in Bloomberg Businessweek's 14th biennial ranking of full-time MBA programs.

Iraq War Veterans Sue Major Banks For Alleged Role In Deadly Military AttacksIraq War Veterans Sue Major Banks For Alleged Role In Deadly Military Attacks
Reuters
(Adds four banks declining to comment in paragraph 3, adds law  professor in paragraphs 10-11)
By Alison Frankel
NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Wounded U.S. veterans and  family members of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq sued five  European banks on Monday, seeking to hold them responsible for  shootings and roadside bombings because they allegedly processed  Iranian money that paid for the attacks.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New  York, named Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG  , HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland  Group Plc and Standard Chartered.
Barclays, Credit Suisse, RBS and Standard Chartered declined  to comment. HSBC did not respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit was brought under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act, a  1992 law that permits victims to bring private suits against  alleged financiers of militant operations.
The lawsuit alleges the banks conspired with Iranian banks  to mask wire transactions in order to evade U.S. sanctions. The  Iranian banks then funneled more than $100 million to militant  groups that operated in Iraq at Iran's direction, according to  the suit.
The militant groups included a Shi'ite militia in Iraq,  Kataib Hezbollah, as well as Quds Force, the overseas arm of  Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the suit says.
Since 2009, the five banks have agreed to pay about $3.2  billion to the U.S. government to resolve allegations that they  handled money in violation of sanctions against nations such as  Iran, Libya and Cuba. All the banks signed deferred prosecution  agreements with the U.S. Justice Department in addition to  settlements with U.S. banking regulators.
The agreements did not allege a link between the  transactions, which the U.S. government viewed as unlawful, and  militant operations.
Patrick Farr, a California-based plaintiff whose son Clay  was killed by a roadside bomb in February 2006, said the lawsuit  has given him "a sense that I was able to do something, hold  someone accountable for his death."
The case faces major obstacles, said Jimmy Gurule, a Notre  Dame University law professor. The Anti-Terrorism Act does not  specifically permit conspiracy claims, and federal courts in New  York have previously refused to permit cases to proceed unless  they allege a direct link between banks and militant attacks.
The law also bars claims for wartime injuries. "The law was  not intended to give a private right of action to soldiers in a  military conflict," Gurule said.
UNIQUE USE OF 1992 LAW
The suit is the first case under the Anti-Terrorism Act in  which former U.S. soldiers seek damages against international  banks. It is also one of the first to be crafted as a conspiracy  case.
The lawyers who filed the suit, Gary Osen and Tab Turner,  were part of a team that tried an Anti-Terrorism Act case  against Arab Bank earlier this year in Brooklyn.  Jurors found Arab Bank liable for financing 24 Hamas attacks in  Israel and the Palestinian Territories between 2001 and 2004.
That case linked Arab Bank specifically to wire transfers to  alleged Hamas leaders and payments to Palestinians killed,  injured and imprisoned in the anti-Israel uprising.
The new lawsuit does not assert a direct connection between  the European banks and the allegedly Iran-directed attacks  carried out in Iraq. Instead, the complaint claims that the  banks indirectly facilitated the attacks by entering into  agreements with Iranian banks to mask U.S. dollar wire  transactions sent through the United States.
"Each defendant understood that their conduct was part of a  larger scheme engineered by Iran," Osen said in an interview. At  a minimum, he said, the banks were "deliberately indifferent"  about the transactions they processed for Iran.
Osen said that through press accounts, declassified U.S.  military reports and documents posted by WikiLeaks, he built a  file on attacks on U.S. forces that were traceable to Iran. One  of the boldest attacks took place in January 2007, when  attackers dressed as American soldiers infiltrated a compound in  Kerbala, Iraq, and killed five U.S. military personnel.
Charlotte Freeman, whose husband Brian was one of the  soldiers killed in Kerbala, said she and her mother-in-law  decided to join the case to make a statement. "I never suspected  these big banks would turn a blind eye," she said. "Even if the  case doesn't get that far, at least the story is told. It needs  to be exposed."

Investigate Time Warner and Comcast s "Social Contract" on AmericaFrom: " The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal and Free the Net ."
It is Time to Stop the Merger Talks and Start the Investigations -- We've Been Played.
Time Warner Cable (TWC) cable TV rates in Brooklyn NY increased 306 percent from 1992-to-November, 2014, from $22.95 a month to $93.16 a month.
My last post featured a marked-up TWC Triple Play bill which went from an advertised price of $89.99 to $190.77 in a period of about 2 years. Besides the fact that you can never, ever get the advertised price, or that the bill now includes a collection of made up fees and pass-through taxes, there are also a host of related issues that surround the sale and promotion of these services. And while this focused on Time Warner, the other cable companies are also engaged in the same questionable practices.
22 Years of Cable Prices: How Did They Get Away with Continuous Increases?
I decided to see what happened before I got that Triple Play in 2012. So, to close the loop, I rummaged through dust-covered boxes to find my old TWC bills. I had a stand alone, regular cable TV service, starting in 1992 until through 2007, when the price went from $22.95 a month to $61.96 a month by 2007.
However, in updating the info (using my current triple play and Time Warner's pricing guides), I found that basic cable service is now $93.16 a month -- a 306 percent increase, (and in the triple play package, the cable costs come to $87.76).
I'll get to what happened to the cable prices in a moment.
The Social Contract on America
Truth is, I was looking to answer a specific question -- Did Time Warner remove the $5.00 a month charge on my bill after the Social Contract expired in 2000?
Short Answer: No.
We wrote about the Social Contract before (and in "The Book of Broken Promises" ).
To sum up, in 1995, there was an agreement between the cable companies and the FCC called the Social Contract and it allowed Time Warner (and Comcast) to add up to $5.00 a month to pay for network upgrades (like high-speed Internet) and the wiring of schools.
The Time Warner Social Contract was for 5 years, starting in 1995, and the company was required to invest $4 billion "to rebuild and upgrade all of its domestic cable systems". In exchange, TW was able to raise rates $1.00 in the first year, and up to $5.00 a month extra in the fifth year.
The companies also committed to bring the Internet to schools in their franchise areas. While it varies by company, in general, schools were all to be given free cable modem service, a free cable modem, (the electronic box designed to let the customer use the Internet), -- and would receive the inside wiring at cost. Moreover, the Time Warner "Social Contract" specifically states that the first modem is free and all of the other modems in the school will be 'at cost.'
No Drop in Price to Customers After the Social Contract Expired -- Or Ever.
Last I heard, if you sign a contract with someone to pay them $5.00 extra a month, when the contract expires, then, the company can't keep charging you. Not in this case.
If you had continuous cable service since January 2001, you will have paid an extra $835.00 (though November, 2014) not counting all the extra franchise fees that are passed through, which added $41.75 (though it may vary around the US). On TWC's New York City bills, it is 5 percent on all cable charges.
The bills showed that there was no drop in any year during the period and that the actual increases of the total bill on top of what would have been added from the Social Contract alone (1995-2000), was $24.00 for the year 1996 to $81.60 extra in 2000. In 2001, it cost an extra $14.07 a month  ($168.84 for the year) above the 1995 price per month.
I decided to see if there was any wisdom to explain the Social Contract so I scoured the Time Warner Cable and Comcast annual and quarterly SEC filed reports for guidance. TWC actually detailed in one quarterly report that there were increases in revenues and profits from the addition of this Social Contract.
TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P., MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, 3rd Quarter ended September 30, 1997
"Revenues benefited from an increase in basic cable and Primestar-related, direct broadcast satellite subscribers, increases in regulated cable rates as permitted under Time Warner Cable's "social contract" with the FCC and an increase in advertising and pay-per-view revenues. EBITDA and operating income increased as a result of the revenue gains, as well as net gains of approximately $15 million recognized in 1997 in connection with the sale or exchange of certain cable systems." (Emphasis added.)
Conclusion: Time Warner did increase bills as part of the Social Contract, which was supposed to terminate in 2000, which helped the company's financial bottom line. And, there was no removal of the extra charges starting in 2001. In fact, there were a host of other increases to the cable service bill.
How Did the Cable Bill Keep Increasing? -- By Sneaky Means.
Because of the laws and agreements, there was a plan afoot-- keep one line item, 'Basic Tier', at a relatively low cost and let the companies game the system in multiple ways. They:
Added new extra fees, including some made up fees.
Got customers to pay the companies' 'franchise fees'.
Made the 'cable box' a separate line item, then continuously raised the rental price.
Priced the other "tiers" to be as much as they can get.
Total Bill and "Cable Tiers" - 306 percent Increase.
In 1992, the cable bill had two charges, a 'Basic' tier of channels for $14.95 and a 'Standard' for $8.00. These two groups were originally designed to separate the 'regulated' cable programming channels, such as the original 'over the air' broadcast stations, like CBS or NBC (and the local Public, Educational and Government (PEG) Access Channels) from the less regulated or non regulated channels, from the Food Network to AMC. Notice that by 1994, while the 'Basic' tier pricing went down, while the 'Standard' tier went up.
By 2014, there are now three or more tiers, including the "Preferred or "Variety", not to mention sports packages, Spanish language, etc and each includes a group of different available channels. Click to see Time Warner channels and 'tiers'.
In total, the basic, regular cable TV service (with a 'standard' and 'basic tier') now costs $93.16, from its previous price of $22.95, thus an increase of 306 percent. (I note that the 'triple play' discounted cost for the cable service (with the "Variety" tier), came to $87.76.)
The "Set Top" Box -- Up 398 percent
.
This is the box that connects the TV to the cable service, and the price may include the TV "remote". In 1992 the box and remote were included in the cost of the service, but was definitely a separate line item by the 1994 bill at $2.26 ($.20 for the remote).
By 2014, the set top box is $11.25 monthly. I note that Time Warner Cable requires you rent their box, and yet it is not included in the advertised price of the service.
Added Fees: Regulatory Fee, Broadcast Fee, Public Access Fee, Franchise Fee.
In 1992 there were no added fees. In 1995, we see a sneaky FCC 'regulatory fee' which went up to $.08 a month, but the largest added fee was in 1998, when they added a separate "franchise" fee -- which is a fee on the company for its use of the Public Rights of Way (PROW) but that they can pass on to you and it is capped at 5 percent. By 2014, we also have an additional, itemized  "Broadcast TV fee" and "Public Access" fee.
Time Warner writes: What is the Broadcast TV fee?
"We pay fees for the right to carry broadcasters' signals, and those costs increased by almost 40 percent in 2013. Most customers will not be impacted by this fee, which is a portion of what we pay to broadcasters."
97 percent Profit Margins on High-Speed Internet?-- The Social Contract and Throw Away "Fair and Reasonable".
This information comes directly from the Time Warner 2013 Annual Report and it gives the break-out of the service revenues per subscriber, as well as costs to offer the service per subscriber for Cable TV (and video), High-speed Internet and Digital Voice.
According to Time Warner, the company brings in, on average, $43.92 for the high-speed data/Internet services per customer, and it cost the company $1.32 to offer -- a 97 percent profit margin -- or another way of looking at this, it has 3227 percent profits above the cost to provide the service.
NOTE: A 10 percent profit margin would mean that you would be paying $1.32 + $.13 cents.
Let's put this in context:
Is this Fair and Reasonable? With a 97 percent profit margin on high-speed Internet, it brings up a question --  The Social Contract charged customers extra for upgrades, including high speed Internet. More importantly, that Social Contract charge should have stopped, but didn't. The extra $5.00 helped to generate these profits -- and it is a simple case of corporate gluttony. Is this 'fair and reasonable'?
Where is any investigation of these obscene profits?
Also, with 97 percent profit margins it is clear that the Internet, broadband services are getting a free ride and are cross-subsidized by the cable TV customers. I.e., the Internet service doesn't pay market pricing for use of the cable networks, which would lower the price of cable TV services.
But this also brings up question about the "total bill".  How can regulators claim that there is competition in this marketplace when there are continuous price increases? If one of the services is almost pure profits, then why shouldn't the entire package of voice, video and data services be examined for 'fair and reasonable' pricing?
They Argue: We Added Hundreds of Channels. Who Cares?
The cable companies will say that they added hundreds of new channels and  programs, and that they cost more and more money and .. blah, blah, blah (this is a technical term).
Nielsen is the bible on TV viewing and  from 2008-2013, while there have been a growing number of channels, people only watch about 17 stations per household. That's it.
According to Nielsen :
"The average U.S. TV home now receives 189 TV channels--a record high and significant jump since 2008, when the average home received 129 channels. Despite this increase, however, consumers have consistently tuned in to an average of just 17 channels."
The tiers were set up to maximize profits for the companies; they are not about, for example, allowing the customer to select the programs they watch.
School Wiring for High Speed Broadband and Internet?
Finally, we can find no reports to the FCC or local municipal franchisors that detailed how many schools were wired for high-speed Internet and broadband services. Reports from auditors in multiple states who examine the communications bills of schools indicate that the companies never wired most of the schools in their areas.
However, one must remember, that for every school not wired under these programs, they most likely applied for federal and state Universal Service Funds (USF) for eRate support for these undelivered services and connectivity. And on your communications bills, all 'interstate' charges -- wireline or wireless, have a federal USF tax, currently hovering around 16 percent being applied. Billions of dollars extra appears to have been added to America's bills because the schools weren't upgraded.
We are looking for any information or documentation about this. What happened in your community?
Bottom Line - Why is there any discussion of mergers? It is time for immediate investigations of the continuous increases in rates, the Social Contract commitments and fulfillment, and the whether your area's schools were or were not wired.
I note that Sullivan County in New York State, has written a letter for an investigation by the NY Public Service Commission, which has responsibility for cable and telecommunications regulation and oversight.

Stocks closed mostly lower Wednesday as the major indexes pulled back slightly from record highs.
The financial sector was a drag on the markets after six big banks were fined $4.3 billion in a settlement over foreign exchange manipulation charges ,
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.70 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 17,612.20. The blue-chip index broke its 6-day winning streak.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was lower for the first time in six trading days as it dropped 1.40 points, or 0.1% to 2038.25. The Dow and S&P had previously closed at record highs for the past five consecutive sessions.
Bucking the trend, the Nasdaq composite index was up 14.58 points, or 0.3%, to 4675.14.
Among the banks being fined by U.S. and European regulators were: Citibank (C) , JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPM) , Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) , HSBC Bank (HSBC) and UBS (UBS) . The investigation is not over, with Barclays (BCS) among the banks that have yet to settle on a fine.
Forex traders plotted strategy in secret chats
"The fines from the watchdogs took some of the wind out of the market," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital Management. But a slight dip following six days of record highs "is actually healthy," he said. "That's the sign of a good bull market. Going straight up every day would be reckless."
Retail stocks were also in focus as Macy's (M) jumped more than 5% to $61.57 after reporting earnings that beat estimates . The retailer's earnings report was not all rosy though as the company reported a sales shortfall and cut its outlook.
J.C. Penney (JCP) reports after the bell Wednesday and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Kohl's (KSS) are expected to report results on Thursday.
Oil prices were lower as benchmark U.S. crude oil was down 1.5% to $76.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.47%, up from 2.36% in the previous session.
Overseas, Japan Nikkei's 225 hit a seven-year high, rising 72.94 points, or 0.4%, to close at 17,197.05 as the yen continued to slide amid rumors that the government will postpone an upcoming tax hike.
The rumors and their effect on Japanese stocks "will be a key focus for Asian markets today," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. "If true, this move will better synchronize government fiscal policy with central bank stimulus initiatives, improving confidence and the outlook for the domestic economy in the medium term."
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 129.90 points, or 0.6%, to finish at 23,938.18 and the Shanghai composite rose 24.8 points, or 1.0%, to close at 2494.48.
European benchmarks were lower: Britain's FTSE 100 was down  0.3% to 6611.04, Germany's DAX tumbled 1.7% to 9210.96 and France's CAC 40 dropped 1.5% to 4179.88.

Get your crystal ball: 2015 market outlooksHow to evaluate 2015 market outlooks

2014 is nearing an end. And that means Wall Street stock market strategists will start peering into their crystal balls and making predictions about where the stock market is heading next year — and why.
Here’s a cheat sheet on key things to watch:
1. Year-end S&P 500 price target. This is basically where strategists think the stock market, as measured by the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index, will end 2015. It basically gives you an idea if the strategist is bullish or bearish on the market’s prospects. The S&P 500 closed Tuesday at 2039.68. So, a year-end 2015 target of 2240 basically equates to a 10% gain. A year-end target for next year that’s lower than where the market ends 2014 means the strategist is predicting a down year.
2. Key investment themes. Price targets alone don’t provide much information. What an investor really wants to know is what could drive stock prices up — or down. For example, listen closely to what Wall Street has to say about the Federal Reserve’s transition to higher interest rates and whether that will cause turbulence. Or the effect of a Republican-controlled Congress. With U.S. stocks at record highs, is the U.S. still the place to be? Or are there foreign markets trading cheaper that offer better long-term opportunities. Are there any potential shocks out there?
3. Profit forecasts. Profits are the gas that drives the market engine. What’s the 2015 earnings outlook? What will drive profits?

Modi and Obama met each other for the second time in six weeks at a Gala Dinner in Myanmar capital after the President played host to the Prime Minister at the White house in Washington in the last week of September.
“Prez Obama greets PM @narendramodi at Gala dinner – ‘You are a man of action!,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin tweeted after the dinner.
The dinner was hosted by Myanmar President Thein Sein for world leaders attending the ASEAN and the East Asian summits.
On the eve of their summit talks, Obama had hosted a rare private dinner for Modi at the White House on September 29.
Modi was welcomed by Obama who greeted him in Gujarati, “Kem Chho?” (how are you?), the mother tongue of the Prime Minister.
Set in an informal ambience, the dinner was the first opportunity for both the leaders to interact with each other.

European spacecraft lands on cometPrint
By: Associated Press | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:55 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 8:28 am
The European Space Agency says it has succeeded in landing a spacecraft on a comet for the first time in history.
The agency says it has received a signal from the 100-kilogram (220-pound) Philae lander after it touched down on the icy surface of the comet named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Flight director Andrea Accomazzo says “we definitely confirm that the lander is on the surface.”
Further checks are needed to ascertain the state of the lander.
The landing on the speeding comet marks the highlight of the decade-long Rosetta mission to study comets and learn more about the origins of these celestial bodies.

Posco to invest 20 million USD in Gujarat: South Korean AmbassadorPrint
Written by Avinash Nair | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:41 pm
One of the world’s biggest steel manufacturer – Posco- is expected to be the first major South Korean investor in Gujarat. According to the Ambassador of the Republic of South Korea, Joongyu Lee, the company has firmed up plans to invest 20 million USD or (Rs 123 crore) in the state.
“Posco has decided to invest 20 million USD in building a steel coil mill in Gujarat,” said Lee while talking to mediapersons during his visit to the city here on Wednesday. Lee is leading a 60-member delegation from South Korea which includes representatives from the Posco Group.
The South Korean steel giant already holds about 26 percent equity in Posco Poggenamp Electrical Steel Pvt Ltd that has operations in Gujarat.
“South Korean investment in Gujarat is minimal and so we are here to explore opportunities,” said Lee while stating how his country’s presence is limited to a couple of companies in the power sector.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Ambassador met Gujarat chief  minister Anandiben Patel at Gandhinagar. Later, a round-table meeting between Korean corporate executives and state government officials were also held. “The Gujarat government has proposed to build a exclusive zone for Korean companies in Gujarat. However, this is just at an ideation stage,” said Lee while simultaneously stating how South Koreans were concentrating more on the upcoming Korean industrial park at Neemrana in Rajasthan.
“The meeting with Gujarat government officials were more an exchange of ideas. However, companies like Samsung and LG are keen to explore opportunities in the state,” Lee added.
In the evening the South Korean Ambassador addressed the Korea-Gujarat friendship forum held at Ahmedabad where he traced back Korean and Indian bilateral ties to a 2000 year-old-incident where according to Lee an Indian princess from Ayodhya, travelled all the way to Korea and married a Korean King. Lee said that one-fourth of the population of Korea including him, were descendants of this Korean-Indian couple.
Recollecting his meeting with Narendra Modi who was at the helm of affairs in Gujarat last year, Lee said that he was right in choosing a state which has been a proved to be a “nursery” for the political career of Modi who has gone on to become the Prime Minister of the country.
According to him the size of bilateral trade between India and Korea stood at 17 billion USD and more than 450 Korean companies had invested 3.5 billion USD in India.
SEZ of Gujarat and the DMIC corridor in Gujarat presents a lot of potential for future Korean investments in the state, Lee said while addressing businessmen from the state at the forum.  This could be in the areas of automobiles, infrastructure, petrochemicals, renewable energy, shipbuilding, textiles and tourism, he added.
B2B networking session hosted by Korea International Trade Association and a meeting of Small and medium companies hosted by Korea Trade-Investment Promotion agency was hosted at two different hotels in the city. Top leaders of the companies like Hyundai Motors, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Posco India, Doosan Power System India, Hyosung, Hyundai Construction, Nuga Medical India, continued…

Traders of major banks fined $4.3 billion Wednesday for attempted manipulation of foreign exchange markets used electronic chat rooms to plot their moves.
Transcript excerpts of conversations released Wednesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show traders from U.S. banks Citibank ( C ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), coordinated their currency trades with colleagues at Swiss banking giant UBS ( UBS ), London-based HSBC ( HSBC ) and other financial institutions.
Banks fined $4.3B in foreign exchange probe
The cryptic chats feature references to "cable" trades — shorthand for transactions involving the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate. The excerpts also show the traders often colluded to focus their moves on the daily 4 p.m. London time market "fix" — the most widely referenced time when world foreign exchange benchmarks are set.
Traders also used the code "lhs" or left-hand side if they had orders to sell the first currency listed in the currency pair transaction under discussion, and "rhs" or right-hand side if they had orders to sell the second currency listed in that pair.
One exchange, featuring participants from Citibank, JPMorgan and Swiss bank UBS, showed traders at one point speaking more like mob conspirators than bank employees as they discuss whether to invite a fourth trader into a private chat room:
UBS Trader: 7:49:55 are we ok with keeping this as is
7:50:27 ie the info lvls & risk sharing?
Citibank Trader: 7:50:27 well…
UBS Trader: 7:50:30 that is the qu[estion]
Citibank Trader: 7:50:32 you know him best obv…
7:50:39 if you think we need to adjust it
7:50:43 then he shouldn't be[] in chat
JPMorgan Trader: 7:50:54 yeah that is key
7:51:00 simple question [UBS trader]
7:51:08 I trust you implicitly [UBS trader]
7:51:13 and your judgement
7:51:21 will he tell rest of desk stuff
7:51:26 or god forbin his nyk…
Citibank Trader: 7:51:46 yes
7:51:51 that's really imp[ortant] q[uestion]
7:52:01 dont want other numpty's in mkt to know
7:52:17 but not only that
7:52:21 is he gonna protect us
7:52:33 like we protect each other against our own branches
7:52:46 ie if you guys are rhs1
.. and my nyk is lhs..ill say my nyk lhs in few
UBS Trader: 7:53:52 what concerns me is that i know he'll never tell us when at risk…
Following further discussion about whether the fourth trader would "add huge value to this cartell," the group decided to invite the trader into the chat room for a "1 month trial." The Citibank trader issued what investigators characterized as a presumably facetious warning: "Mess this up and sleep with one eye open at night."
In another chat room, a trader for HSBC and a trader for another institution identified as Bank W discussed unloading their trading positions just before the fix period, starting at 3:54 p.m.:
Bank W Trader 3: 3:54:32 pm: can u let me know when are down to your last tenner
HSBC Trader: 3:55:02 pm: ok
HSBC Trader: 3:55:10 pm: i'm down to my last tenner
Bank W Trader 3: 3:55:17 pm: ok ta
Bank W Trader 3: 3:55:41 pm: just sold some more
HSBC Trader: 3:55:49 pm: hahaha
Bank W Trader 3: 3:55:51 pm: hehehe
Bank W Trader 3: 4:00:57 pm: nice on[e] son
HSBC Trader: 4:03:15 pm: learnt from a good fella
Bank W Trader 3: 4:15:43 pm: there u go
Bank W Trader 3: 4:16:48 pm: go early, move it, hold it, push it
And yet another excerpt shows that traders from two banks teamed up in an alleged effort to manipulate the daily foreign exchange fix.
At 3:43:50 p.m. London time, a trader from Bank W asked a trader from JPMorgan whether he needed to buy euros in the market in the forthcoming fix. The JPMorgan trader responded that he had a net buy order for the fix, which he subsequently confirmed as totaling 105 million euros.
At 3:44:04 p.m. the JPMorgan trader offered to transfer that net buy order to the Bank W trader. The Bank W trader replied "maybe" and then stated that he had a net buy order for 150 million euros.
Bank W Trader: 3:46:53 i'd prefer we join forces
JPMorgan Trader: 3:46:56 perfick
JPMorgan Trader: 3:47:11 lets double team them
Bank W Trader: 3:47:12 YESssssssssssss
Immediately after the fixing window, the traders congratulated themselves.
Bank W Trader: 4:03:25 sml rumour we haven't lost it
JPMorgan Trader: 4:03:45 we
4:03:46 do
4:03:48 dollarrr
Dozens of foreign exchange traders at major banks were placed on leave or terminated during investigations of the market manipulation, according to statements by the banks and media reports. In the wake of Wednesday's enforcement actions, some traders could face individual charges as investigators in the U.S. and Europe continue their probes.
Amid the investigations, banks took steps to monitor traders' use of chat rooms and bar improper behavior and disclosures during exchanges. The FCA said it is "especially important that firms exercise appropriate control and monitoring of such communications."

More high schools teach manufacturing skills

Javier Tamayo works at Bridgestone right out of high school, after learning many of his skills at Wheeling High School's innovative manufacturing program.

WHEELING, ILL. — Javier Tamayo looks like a journeyman machinist as he briskly turns a wrench to replace a chipped tool in a computerized cutting device at Bridgestone's metal parts factory here.
Tamayo, 19, landed the $12-an-hour job last year after graduating from Wheeling High School's manufacturing program and is on his way to a career that pays upwards of $80,000 a year.
Wheeling has been turning out hire-ready manufacturing workers like Tamayo for six years. It's one of a growing number of U.S. high schools that have launched or revived manufacturing programs in recent years to guide students toward good-paying jobs and help fill a critical shortage of skilled machinists, welders and maintenance technicians.
Manufacturing courses were dropped from vocational education programs as the industry declined over the past three decades and no one tracks how many high schools offer them now. But Project Lead the Way, which creates high school engineering and technology curricula, says one manufacturing class it designed for Wheeling is offered in about 800 schools — nearly twice as many as in 2009.
The training targets a glaring imbalance in the labor market. Despite high unemployment since the recession, manufacturers still struggle to fill hundreds of thousands of job openings. Since bottoming out in February 2010, employment at U.S. factories has risen by 700,000 to 12.1 million, recouping about 30% of the jobs the industry lost in the downturn.
Manufacturers are increasingly looking to high schools and community colleges to fill current staffing needs and gear up for a wave of Baby Boomer retirements. Educators are trying to dispel student's misconceptions about the industry and spark their interest before they choose other jobs or head to four-year colleges, a costly career investment that has yielded disappointing results for some graduates.
Jobs and the aging manufacturing workforce

Manufacturing is dogged by an outdated image that it's "very physical, labor-intensive, you're working with your hands, you're getting dirty and there's no career path," says Gardner Carrick, vice president of the Manufacturing Institute, the industry's training arm. Actually, "you're working with computers and robots that are doing what you used to do by hand. That requires a skill set (in math and science) above what was required a generation ago."
Lessons from Germany
The high school programs borrow  from Germany's education model, which forces students to choose a career track and take part in internships as early as age 15. Many are channeled into skilled labor jobs, which are more highly respected than they are in the U.S. After building plants in the U.S. in recent years, several German companies are teaming with U.S. community colleges to replicate that apprenticeship system in this country.
Several years ago, Siemens, the German energy conglomerate, sought to train new U.S. workers for a 1,500-employee turbine and generator plant it was opening in Charlotte in 2011. But only 10% of applicants passed a math and science aptitude test and only about 450 of 3,000 people it trained for five months were hired. So Siemens partnered with Central Piedmont Community College to create a program that supplies machinists for the factory. High school seniors and graduates who enter the program earn associate degrees while serving as paid apprentices at Siemens for 3½ years. When they're done, they're guaranteed a $55,000 a year job at Siemens.
Where the jobs are: The new blue collar
"You're getting paid, you have no debt and you get a job at $55,000," says Eric Spiegel, CEO of Siemens USA. "The average liberal arts graduate (from a four-year college) is making less than $40,000" or can't find a position in their field. "Meanwhile, we can't fill these technical jobs."
Other Charlotte-area manufacturers are also taking part in the program, most of them German.
Another German company, Volkswagen, went a step further, building its own academy next to the 3,200-employee assembly plant it opened three years ago in Chattanooga, Tenn. Instructors from Chattanooga State Community College teach high school graduates and others to maintain and repair robots at the plant while they serve apprenticeships at the factory.
The company-specific training isn't cheap. It costs Volkswagen about $1 million to put each student through the three-year program. "We are interested in having our own skilled team members who ... have to be familiar with our equipment," says Sebastian Patta, the plant's executive vice president of human resources. Toyota has a similar program at its factory in Georgetown, Ky.
President Obama's Advanced Manufacturing Partnership is working to spread the community-college-apprenticeship model across the USA, initially through programs led by Siemens, Dow and Alcoa in Texas, California, Illinois and Minnesota. The group plans to release an online manual that provides a road map for schools and employers in other states.
"We're looking for ways to get more communities involved and to scale this," says Siemens' Spiegel, who's on the partnership's steering committee.

A draw for 'A' and 'C' students
Wheeling and other high schools aim to spur students' interest in manufacturing and familiarize them with equipment, rather than turn out fully formed craftspeople. Tom Iida, president of Bridgestone, which makes construction and mining equipment parts, says Tamayo had to be trained for eight weeks when he was hired, though he learned quickly.
"We have high hopes for him," he says.
In the six years since Wheeling and other schools in Illinois District 214 began their manufacturing classes, the number of participating students has increased to 216, nearly doubling since 2012. The schools are providing a growing labor pool for factories in metropolitan Chicago, one of the nation's most manufacturing-intensive areas.
Wheeling's manufacturing lab, nestled in a quiet corner of the bustling school, almost resembles a small factory, with three hulking computerized machines to cut and shape metal, two manual mills, a drill press, a laser cutter and other devices. In another room with rows of PCs, students write programs that tell the digital machines how to shape formless metal or wood.

When the classes started in 2008, instructors initially faced resistance from parents turned off by the industry's gritty image and wedded to the idea of their kids attending a four-year college. "You go up to a parent and you say we have manufacturing classes, and they walk away," says Wheeling teacher Michael Geist. "But you say manufacturing-engineering and you show them the kinds of things" kids are doing in class "and they become excited."
The traditional college route is an option for Peter Barts, a strapping junior at the district's Elk Grove High School in nearby Elk Grove Village. His father is a lawyer, and he gets high grades and takes advanced placement physics and math classes. But, he says, "I've always loved working with my hands."
Until he began taking manufacturing classes this year, "I thought of it as you're doing exactly the same thing over and over again." He changed his mind when he learned that machinists use judgment to program computerized machines to trim metal to precise specifications measured in ten thousandths of an inch.
Barts says he plans to be a welder, which can pay upwards of $100,000 a year with overtime, or a shop-class teacher. Either way, he may get additional training at a community college. "For me, it's not work — it's something that I love doing," he says before donning a protective mask to practice on the school's welding simulator. "Once you're done building something, you have this sense of pride — 'I did that.' "
There are also financial benefits: "I won't pay as much (for school) as students who are going to a four-year college," Barts says.
"Whatever makes him happy," says Peter's father, David Barts. "People think that if you don't have a piece of paper that says you went to college that you're no good. … It's wrong."
For struggling students, the program provides inspiration and a potential career path. Before he took Wheeling's advanced manufacturing class this fall, junior Adrian Trego had poor grades and often neglected his homework.
Now, he says he's getting B's and C's in geometry, chemistry and literature and plans to work as a machinist after he graduates. "With this class, I have the motivation," Trego says after furiously turning the crank of a manual milling machine to flatten a small metal block in Wheeling's lab.
"It's a way out," Trego adds. "I don't want to be working at McDonald's."
Where the Jobs Are:  Manufacturing 11Alive News
Manufacturers: Potential for growth
Many  pursue industrial careers. A third of the graduating students are hired by local factories, earning starting wages of $12-$16 an hour, a third continue their training at a local community college, and the rest scatter to other careers.
District officials work with about 100 local manufacturers to help design classes and establish internships for some students.
Despite the successes of the high school and community college programs, there are hurdles to importing Germany's apprenticeship model to the U.S. The demand for workers still far outstrips the number of students taking courses.
Bridgestone's Iida is frustrated that the competition for interns among local manufacturers is so fierce that the school hasn't provided the firm any the past two summers. "I would love to get more," he says.
Community colleges also are turning out more prospective employees but not keeping up with demand. Nationwide, community colleges awarded 1,557 associate degrees or certificates in manufacturing last year, according to the American Association of Community Colleges. That's up from 616 in 2005 but below the nearly 1,600 doled out in 2000.
Spiegel of Siemens says just 15 apprentices are in the company's program with Central Piedmont Community College, a total he would like to substantially increase. He also wants to encourage more U.S.-based manufacturers in the Charlotte area to join the partnership with the college.
"One of (manufacturers') concerns is — if I train people for 3½ years, somebody else can come along and hire them," he says. "If you just have a few companies doing this in certain markets, it is a little bit of a risky investment."
The solution, he says, is to blanket the country with such programs. "I think this is really a path to America's new middle class," Spiegel says.

Brent Oil at $81  Near 4-Year LowGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
London: Brent crude slipped near $81 a barrel on Wednesday, just above a four-year low hit in the previous session with prices under pressure from the growing oil glut created by the US shale boom and the restart of Libya's largest operational oilfield.
With oil prices down 30 per cent since June, delegates in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are starting to suggest they may push for an informal output cut of around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) when the producer group meets in Vienna on November 27.
But they have warned an agreement within OPEC will not be easy, and many oil traders and analysts doubt members will take a decisive stance as they compete to hold onto market share.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, said its oil production was little changed in October in OPEC's monthly report on Wednesday, even as the group forecast demand for its oil next year will drop to 29.2 million bpd - almost 1 million less than it is currently producing.
"The consensus view is OPEC won't take any action, or if it does, not big enough or sufficiently definitive to have too much impact on prices," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets.
Brent for December delivery fell 61 cents to $81.06 by 1453 GMT (8:23 p.m. in India). It dropped 67 cents on Tuesday after first touching $80.46, its lowest since September 2010.
US crude was down 65 cents at $77.29 a barrel.
Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said an unofficial 500,000-bpd cut by OPEC would be "by no means enough to restore any sort of balance" to the oil market.
"Evidently the market is keen to test out OPEC's pain threshold," Mr Fritsch said.
Adding to supply, Libya restarted production at its large El Sharara oilfield, a spokesman for National Oil Corp (NOC) said, though exports remained blocked from the 120,000-bpd Hariga port by protesters involved in a wage dispute. The smaller El Feel field is also shut.
The oil minister of Iran, one of the OPEC members hardest hit by lower prices, on Tuesday met Kuwait's emir as part of a tour aimed at winning support to stabilise oil markets. Kuwait's oil minister has said a cut is unlikely.
US oil inventory data due on Wednesday and Thursday could show a build in crude stocks of 800,000 barrels in the week ended November 7, according to a Reuters poll of analysts. The data has been delayed for a day by a federal holiday.

FT Editor Trashes Piketty s Book Just Before FT Names It Book Of The YearTop FT Editor Lambasts Piketty's Book Just Before FT Names It Book Of The Year

reddit
The Financial Times has declared that Thomas Piketty's Capital In The Twenty-First Century is the best business book of the year, which kinda-sorta makes up for that time it declared the book was riddled with errors.
In fact, the FT editor who criticized the French economist's blockbuster, 700-page tome on inequality is sticking by his critique, even after his newspaper on Tuesday named Capital the winner of the 2014 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award .
Capital, for the uninitiated, warns that unfettered capitalism tends to widen the gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and that the major economies of the world could be doomed to Gilded Age-style inequality if they don't take steps to stop it. It was, unexpectedly, a red-hot bestseller , exposing broad public anxiety about the fairness of the global economy.
It was not universally praised. Back in May, FT economics editor Chris Giles started a weeks-long brawl with Piketty by saying the book was "undercut by errors" and that "the rock-star French economist appears to have got his sums wrong."
After a lot of back-and-forth between Giles and Piketty on the Internet, several economists came to Piketty's defense , saying Giles' critique had not landed any real blows on the work.
Now the FT itself seems to have come down on Piketty's side, too.
"Capital in the Twenty-First Century emerged after vigorous debate from an incredibly strong field," FT editor Lionel Barber, who chaired the panel of judges that picked the book, said in a press release. "While not everyone agreed on the policy prescription, we recognised the quality of the scholarship. It’s a challenging but ultimately important book."
That has not stopped criticisms of the book's data and conclusions. Salim Furth, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, criticized Piketty's data on Swedish inequality on Wednesday, in a Wall Street Journal blog post.
Giles himself continued to slam the book's data, in a Policy Exchange panel discussion on Tuesday. "Truth-telling with data is important, and I don't think this book does it," Giles said.
In that talk, which happened just hours before the FT's announcement of the business-book award, Giles took a moment to acknowledge the strangeness of the situation: "It is perfectly possible, given the eclectic organization that the FT is, that we will say Capital is the business book of the year and also sort of slagged it off at the same time this year."
The Financial Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Giles declined additional comment.
This post has been updated to reflect that Giles declined to make additional comment.

Pakistan court issues arrest warrants against Imran  QadriBy: Press Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: November 12, 2014 11:24 pm
An anti-terrorism court today issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan and fiery cleric Tahirul Qadri for attacking the state Television building and the Parliament during protests here in September.
Dawn online reported that the court in Islamabad also issued arrest warrants for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Pervez Khattak, PTI Vice-Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi, PTI leader Asad Umar and PAT leader Raheeq Abbasi.
A case was registered against these leaders at secretariat police station in Islamabad.
In September, protesters broke into the PTV headquarters and took over the programming control room and transmission was taken off air temporarily.
Later, army stepped in to remove them and restore the transmission. But the protesters damaged furniture and television equipment during the rampage.
They also took away rare pictures, food items from canteen and even the sound system from the building’s mosque.
Following the attack on PTV, the federal government termed it an act of “aggression and violence”.
The government had said action would be taken in accordance with the law against those responsible for the attack.
Both Qadri and Khan had launched protests in August seeking ouster of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Qadri wrapped up protests last month after a reported deal with the government but Imran is still protesting in
front of parliament.

After appeal  India wants unconditional release of fishermenPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 10:25 pm
A day after it filed an appeal against the Sri Lankan high court verdict giving death sentence to five Indian fishermen, India on Wednesday said it wants “immediate and unconditional” release of its nationals.
India’s reaction assumes significance in the backdrop of the reported statement by Sri Lankan Minister Prabha Ganesan that President Mahinda Rajapaksa was ready to pardon the fishermen on death row for alleged drug smuggling if the Indian High Commission in Colombo does not proceed with an appeal against the sentence.
“The government has always been insisting on the immediate and unconditional release of its fishermen who been sentenced to death the Lankan court. And any avenue which enables that will be pursued,” government sources told PTI, indicating that it will not take back the appeal.
India, on Wednesday, filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka against a verdict of the high court awarding death sentence to the five fishermen for alleged drug smuggling.
Emerson, P Augustus, R Wilson, K Prasath and J Langlet, all hailing from Tamil Nadu, were apprehended in 2011 and were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court on October 30.
Earlier this week,    External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin had said the government would do everything
possible to ensure return of the Indian fishermen in accordance with Sri Lanka’s legal and executive process.
“It is a matter on which we place very high priority. It is also a matter on which we are exploring a variety of avenues to ensure that those citizens of India return to India safely. These avenues are being pursued in accordance with Sri Lanka’s legal system and Sri Lanka’s executive role in the process,” he had said.
The court ruling had triggered fiery protests in parts of Tamil Nadu and sporadic violence broke out in and around Rameswaram island as a large number of people staged protests.
The issue of fishermen is very emotive for both Sri Lanka and India, where Tamil Nadu-based parties including AIADMK and DMK have been regularly pressing the government to take up the matter with the Lankan authorities seriously and have often resented high-profile visits from the island nation.
Earlier, in the week, there were also reports originating from Colombo that Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken to each other on the issue. However, there was no official confirmation on it from the Indian side.
