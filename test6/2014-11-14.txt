SAN FRANCISCO — Comcast CEO Brian Roberts was hoping to keep the focus squarely on new features rolling out to its cloud-based X1 service Wednesday but instead found himself addressing the hot-button issue of net neutrality.
"We're trying to work with the FCC, Congress and the administration to forge an outcome all stakeholders can live with and doesn't harm the innovation cycle," said Roberts, noting that the uncertainty over net neutrality — the notion that all content should be treated equally by Internet service providers — can ultimately stifle investment in new technologies.
Roberts' comments come on the heels of President Obama's comments Monday, in which he called upon the FCC to create rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that "neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online."
Obama is looking to classify ISPs as utilities in an effort to regulate their ability to provide "fast lane" access to specific content, which could create a tiered Internet where some information and videos download more quickly than others. Roberts said he favors the "transparent conversation" that has been ongoing between ISPs and the FCC as opposed to new regulations.
"For 20 years now, we've all played by a set of rules that have helped build the world we enjoy," said Roberts, whose father, Ralph, co-founded Comcast half a century ago.
Roberts also took the opportunity to address a July incident that went viral in which a customer service representative spent 18 minutes trying to talk a client out of disconnecting his service.
"I was embarrassed, disappointed and other thoughts I won't articulate. But my wife said, 'You'll be a better company for it,' and that's true, it was a teaching moment for us," says Roberts.
Turning to the company's X1 service, which is now in 5 million homes, Roberts said it was critical for broadband and entertainment providers to "behave more like (car sharing service) Uber, which changed the old way of doing things and made it better."
Two new customer-centric X1 features are aimed at the visually impaired. One is a talking guide, and the other a new remote control that you can speak into, recalling Siri- and Cortana-like conversations consumers are used to having with the smartphones. Roberts asked his remote to "Find The Godfather" and "What should I watch?" In a matter of seconds the screen lit up with answers.
Roberts said he expects his company's acquisition of Time Warner to go through in the first quarter of next year, which among other ramifications would allow Comcast access to the lucrative markets of New York and Los Angeles.
"It will be nice to have more of a national footprint," he said.

A day before Childrens Day  Odisha boy loses arm working in maizefactoryPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 1:45 am
A day before the nation celebrates Children’s Day, a 12-year-old boy in Nabrangpur district lost his left arm while working in a maize processing factory.
Debi Singh Gouda, a Std VI student of Pujariguda upper primary school in Kasagumuda block of Nabarangpur, had skipped school to work at a maize processing mill in his village Nandpani for a wage of Rs 50. A day before Children’s Day, Orissa boy loses left arm while working in maize factory.
While deseeding corn, the boy’s left hand was sucked inside the machine leaving him seriously injured. He was first rushed to the district headquarters hospital at Nabarangpur and then shifted to the district headquarters hospital at Koraput. Though doctors could save his life, they had to amputate his arm. “It was too mutilated. We had no other option. But he is out of danger now,” said a doctor in Koraput.
Labour minister Prafulla Mallick said a three-member team, headed by sub-collector Parikshit Sethi, has been asked to file a report on the incident. The team on Thursday visited the school and held discussions with the boy’s family members. The district administration also lodged an FIR against the mill owner Lalan Mehta. Mallick assured that strict action would be taken against the guilty.
The district administration gave an ex-gratia of Rs 10,000 from the district Red Cross fund and Rs 5,000 from the chief minister’s relief fund to the family members of the boy.
Officials in Nabrangpur said the boy lost his father while he was a toddler. He has an elder brother and a mother. His brother and mother work as coolies, while Gouda often worked at the maize processing mill to supplement his family income.
Former Nabarangpur Congress MP Pradip Majhi demanded that the government should bear all the expenses for treatment of the boy and
immediately release Rs 5 lakh as assistance to the child’s family. He also demanded inclusion of the boy’s family under the various welfare schemes of the government and allot them a house.
In June this year, a 16-year-old boy’s right hand had to be amputated when it came in contact with a live electric wire while working as a labourer in Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana. Yakub of MV-31 village under Kurukunda block of Malkangri district was working under a contractor in Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana when a six-feet long aluminium rod that he was holding came in contact with the live electric wire. Yakub was first admitted to a private hospital in Vishakhpatnam by the contractor. The boy who studied in a school, worked in the road construction project during summer vacation to buy a pair of uniform.

US: Republicans pick leaders for Senate andHouseWhen the new US Congress convenes in January, Mitch McConnell becomes Senate majority leader.
By: Associated Press | Washington | Posted: November 13, 2014 11:56 pm
When the new US Congress convenes in January, Mitch McConnell becomes Senate majority leader, fulfilling a long-held ambition.
A Senate Republican official said McConnell, 72 , was chosen by acclamation at a closed-door meeting of the party rank and file.
As majority leader, one of the most powerful positions in Congress, McConnell will set the Senate’s agenda. Along with Republican House Speaker John Boehner, he will decide what legislation is sent to the White House in the final two years of President Barack Obama’s term.
McConnell was elected to a sixth Senate term of six years last week in elections in which Republicans gained a majority in the 100-member Senate for the first time in eight year, picking up eight  seats from Democrats and hoping for a ninth in a Louisiana runoff election Dec. 6.
Democrats have assailed him in recent campaigns as a guardian of gridlock for his opposition to nearly all of President Barack Obama’s initiatives. But he also brokered bipartisan deals that ended last year’s government shutdown and averted a 2011 federal default.
Democrats had hoped to defeat him but he outpaced his opponent in the final weeks of the campaign for the seat from the state of Kentucky.
McConnell is a conservative and does not have much charisma.  But his 30 years in the Senate have made him a masterful political tactician. One of his challenges will be keeping in line conservative tea party Republicans who would like to see him take a more hard-line position on some issues.
Neither McConnell nor Boehner faced public opposition on the eve of Thursday’s party elections in closed door meetings.
Boehner, 65, is line to become leader of the House for a third term, also one of the pre-eminent positions in the capital’s political life. Like McConnell, his years in the lower chamber have made him skilled in legislative maneuvering and he also has had difficulties in the past keeping the more conservative Republican members of the House in line.
The Republicans also padded its majority in the 435-member House, where a handful of races remain unresolved. Republicans are on track to equal or eclipse the 246 seats they won in 1946, a figure that stands as a post-World War II high.
Despite sizable election losses, Democrats appeared ready to hand their own leaders another two years at the helm, postponing a generational change that appears not far in the future.
Sen. Harry Reid, a few weeks shy of his 75th birthday, was in line to become the minority leader in the new Congress.  He was first elected Democratic leader in 2004.
Officials said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of liberals and mentioned as a possible rival to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination,  would be given a seat at the leadership table.
Republican Nancy Pelosi , 74, is expected to continued…

The great Game FolioWith Xi making public his determination to expand China’s defence cooperation with Sri Lanka and Colombo backing his Maritime Silk Road initiative, New Delhi can no longer downplay concerns about Beijing’s role in the waters to the south.
Written by C Raja Mohan | Posted: October 29, 2014 12:37 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 10:32 am
China in Lanka
Reports that India has objected to Sri Lanka hosting a Chinese submarine last month are not surprising. In September, a submarine of the Chinese navy docked at the Colombo port just days before President Xi Jinping arrived in Sri Lanka. Last December, there were reports that a Chinese nuclear submarine had surfaced in the waters of Sri Lanka.
With Xi making public his determination to expand China’s defence cooperation with Sri Lanka and Colombo backing his Maritime Silk Road initiative, New Delhi can no longer downplay concerns about Beijing’s role in the waters to the south. The issue of Sri Lanka’s military ties to Beijing was apparently flagged last week by Defence Minister Arun Jaitley when he met the visiting Lankan defence secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who happens to be the brother of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
As it bowed to political pressures from Chennai, the UPA found it hard to balance India’s genuine concerns about the rights of the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka and Delhi’s other national security interests in the island republic. Whether it was voting on Sri Lanka’s human rights record in Geneva, training Lankan defence personnel in Tamil Nadu, or the prime minister’s travel to Colombo to attend the Commonwealth Summit, the Congress leadership simply caved in to pressures from Chennai.
The NDA government is in a much better position to cope with the competing imperatives in Sri Lanka. That Narendra Modi is less vulnerable to Chennai was reflected in his decision to invite President Rajapaksa for his swearing-in ceremony in end-May against the objections of the Tamil parties.
This, in turn, has given Modi a little more space to deal more purposefully with Lanka; but not a lot. For, Modi senses the huge opportunity to expand the BJP’s influence in Tamil Nadu. He is also conscious of the fact that Tamil concerns are very much part of India’s overall approach to Sri Lanka. Modi has begun well by expanding engagement with all the stakeholders involved in the Lanka conflict, including Chennai, Jaffna and Colombo.
The Raj Legacy
India has long opposed the military presence of foreign powers in the subcontinent. This is a geopolitical legacy of the British Raj that was the paramount power in the Indian subcontinent and the guarantor of peace and stability in the Indian Ocean. The Raj ensured that no rival European power would get too close to the subcontinent on the land frontiers or establish a threatening naval presence in the Indian Ocean. As the successor state to the continued…

Warren Buffett s Berkshire to buy DuracellBerkshire Hathaway to acquire P&G's Duracell
Duracell batteries
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Procter & Gamble Warren Buffett
Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it would acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it would buy Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business in exchange for its entire $4.7 billion stake in the world's No. 1 household products maker.
P&G, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it would contribute about $1.8 billion in cash to recapitalize Duracell before the transaction.
Shares of P&G, which also reiterated its full-year organic sales and core earnings growth forecasts, fell about 1 percent before the bell.

The household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands and last month said it would sell Duracell to focus on faster-growing brands.
Demand for Duracell's mainstay non-rechargeable, disposable alkaline batteries has waned while a worldwide explosion in electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries.
Berkshire owned about 52.8 million shares in P&G as of June 30, or a stake of about 1.9 percent, according to the most recent regulatory filing. ( http://1.usa.gov/1lZ2Ca3 )
"I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette," Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Warren Buffett said in a statement.
P&G said it would take a non-cash charge of about 28 cents per share in the current-quarter and said it expects to close the deal in the second half of next year.

Intermission: Wonder WomanWelcome to Intermission! No question today, since I have to run off to media training. But I hope you are having an excellent lunch break all the same.
Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, in “Breaking Bad.”  (Ursula Coyote/AMC via Associated Press)
• “ Battle Tested ,” by Margy Rochlin: This piece is not new, but now that Michelle MacLaren is apparently the front-runner to direct DC’s forthcoming “Wonder Woman” movie, an appointment that would make her the first woman to direct a superhero film, I thought it was worth reupping this look at MacLaren’s oeuvre and approach.
“During her five-year tenure as a director and, eventually, executive producer on ‘Breaking Bad,’ MacLaren became so established as the go-to helmer for episodes involving turmoil, wrung-out despondency and extended gunfire that it helped her land plum directing jobs on AMC’s zombie apocalypse series, ‘The Walking Dead,’ and HBO’s fantasy epic, ‘Game of Thrones,’” Rochlin writes. “‘Breaking Bad’ creator Vince Gilligan, who took to calling her ‘Samantha Peckinpah,’ assigned her to direct ‘To’hajiilee,’ one of the last episodes of the series. It ends spaghetti Western-style with a protracted standoff followed by a desert gun battle in which a gang of white supremacists unload a hailstorm of bullets on two DEA agents. Before both sides start blasting away, MacLaren chose to ratchet up the intensity by pushing in on each of the key characters. ‘I wanted to have a moment [from] the actors’ point of view and everybody feeling, “Oh, my god. Who’s going to be first? What’s going to happen?”‘ she says. ‘That’s how I thought I could help the audience feel that incredible tension and angst that each of these people felt.’”
• “ Me Against the Music ,” by Elizabeth Flock: It seems like a week does not go by without someone getting maced for asking that another audience member turn off their smartphone at the movies or a theater-goer making a grand gesture about the behavior of their fellow patrons. Flock looks specifically at the relationships between popular musicians and their fans and argues that what we are seeing now is part of an ongoing negotiation, one that has been intensified by social media.
“Exactly how audiences are supposed to behave at live shows has been up for debate since the emergence of the genre. There aren’t hard and fast rules like there are in other performative fields, and behavior that would get spectators thrown out of La Scala or Lincoln Center (moshing, crowd surfing, heavy intoxication) is an integral part of the live experience,” she explains. “But there are expectations. They date back to the 1950s, when the emergence of Elvis Presley first triggered hordes of screaming fans in concert halls. Although the singer adored them, the Beatles famously stopped touring because the hysterical teenage girls were so disruptive to their music.”
• “ It’s Time to Bring Back the Banality of Evil ,” by Esther Inglis-Arkell: In a piece that has some things in common with my thoughts yesterday on niceness and complexity in pop culture , Inglis-Arkell suggests that “Everywhere you look, it’s the same boring nihilism, the same boring excuses, and the same slightly-creepy glamour – which is growing boring.”
“If you take a look at these shows, murder seems like the best possible use of one’s time. Murderers are creative artists, well-read intellectuals, social successes, and political players – often all at the same time. You can’t argue with results,” she argues. “Murder isn’t a debilitating drain on their energy and a danger to their lives. It’s a way to express, and implement, their own personal philosophy. Hannibal Lecter weeds out the rude and stupid, while attempting to cherish the exceptional. The killer in the BBC’s ‘The Fall’ quotes Nietzsche – “You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star” – and frames his murders as an expression of the chaos and the indifference of the universe. Dexter Morgan, from ‘Dexter,’ famously rhapsodized about his “dark passenger” driving him to kill and mused about all those baffling normal people around him. Watch enough of these and you get the idea that serial murder is something between a master’s thesis and really aggressive social work.”

Buffett s Berkshire buys Duracell from P&GBuffett snaps up Duracell from P&G

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is getting into the battery business. Buffett is also trimming his stock holdings, while adding to his growing holdings of operating businesses.
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ; BRK.B ) announced Thursday that it will acquire the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble ( PG ). Berkshire will finance the transaction by forking over $4.7 billion in P&G shares it currently owns.
In a statement, Berkshire outlined the deal as follows: “In exchange for a recapitalized Duracell Company, which will include approximately $1.7 billion in cash at closing, P&G will receive shares of P&G’s common stock currently held by Berkshire Hathaway having a current value of approximately $4.7 billion.”
At the end of 2013, P&G was Berkshire’s seventh-biggest stock holding, according to Berkshire filings. Berkshire is the fifth biggest shareholder of P&G stock, with a 52.8 million share stake, according to Yahoo Finance data through June 30.
At Wednesday night’s closing price of $89.48 for P&G, Berkshire’s stake is an estimated $4.74 billion, which means Berkshire is basically trading all of its P&G shares for the operating  business of Duracell. By constructing the Duracell deal with the transfer of Berkshire-owned P&G shares back to P&G, Buffett’s Berkshire was able to minimize the tax hit had it liquidated its shares at a profit in the open market for cash.
“I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,” said Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. “Duracell is a leading global brand with top quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.”
In early trading, Berkshire Hathaway A shares were up $884.06, or 0.4%, to $218,985.06. And shares of P&G were virtually unchanged, falling 2 cents to $89.46.
The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second half of 2015. The deal allows Buffett to add another brand-name business to his portfolio and enables P&G to shed a non-core business.
Buffett’s use of stock to finance the deal, rather than cash, is an emerging trend, as is the shift to buying entire businesses rather than shares of stock, says Lawrence A. Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University and author of the book, Berkshire Beyond Buffett.
“The swap of $4.7 billion of stock in P&G for the Duracell assets continues the trend at Berkshire from a company whose value was mostly in stock picks Buffett made but Berkshire didn’t control — to wholly owned businesses over which Berkshire has total control. …  A similar example occurred late last year when Berkshire swapped stock in Phillips 66 (in exchange) for pipeline lubricant assets.”
Buffett, dubbed the Oracle of Omaha by Wall Street for his prescient market calls and investment acumen, is known for investing in brand-name stocks — and businesses — that are easy-to-understand, have sizable and enduring market shares and are run by solid management teams. Buffett’s major stock holdings via Berkshire Hathaway include well-known brands, such as Coca-Cola, IBM and Wal-Mart. Berkshire also owns businesses, such as ice cream seller Dairy Queen, auto insurer Geico and railroad transportation giant Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
In Berkshire’s recent third-quarter earnings filing, Buffett had this to say about the company’s acquisition strategy: “Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earnings power, good returns on equity and able and honest management.”
And this deal, according to Buffett himself, meets that criterion.
Commenting on the deal to FOX Business Network this morning, Buffett, 84, said: “This is our kind of business. … Not very exciting but a good, solid business. I’m a Duracell guy. Always have been”
“We thank the Duracell employees for their many contributions to the business. They’ve made Duracell the global market leader in the battery category,” said A.G. Lafley, P&G’s CEO. “I’m confident this new ownership structure will provide strong support for Duracell’s future growth plans.”
The sale of Duracell is not a major surprise, as pressure has been growing on the P&G CEO to divest non-core businesses, which includes Duracell, the world’s No. 1 battery business, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report back in June. P&G, the world’s largest consumer-products company, said last month that it would divest Duracell.
“(Duracell is) not a strategic fit for P&G – it doesn’t create any halo or synergy with their other brands,” Pete Sorrentino, a portfolio manager with Huntington Asset Advisors, told the Cincinnati Enquirer in June.
Divestitures are a proven tool for Lafley, according to the Enquirer. During his previous tenure as P&G’s CEO, he sold or spun off most of the company’s food business that included Jif peanut butter, Crisco shortening and Sunny Delight fruit drink. Duracell commands estimated annual sales of $2.6 billion.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Investors know real money is made when others are fearful. That’s even more true when they buy the right stocks that scare investors the most.
Scooping up the seven stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 that cratered 20% during the market’s freakout in late September and early October and raced back with a vengeance — including energy firms Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Newfield (NFX) in addition to tech firm Microchip Technology (MCHP) — turned out to be extremely lucrative for brave investors. These stocks are all up more than 10% from the market’s Ebola-panic induced bottom on Oct. 15 — creating $12.8 billion in market value.
Such breathtaking bouncebacks are a reminder of the impressive money-making power of having nerves of steel during times of market trouble — but also a a huge helping of luck. Here’s why. Investors actually had much better odds simply buying the market itself at the bottom and riding it higher. Of the 21 S&P 500 stocks that dropped 20% or more during the market decline — 14 of them actually bounced back less than the market’s 9.4% gain.
Still, the big winner from the beat down is Chesapeake Energy. Shares of the energy exploration company tanked 28% from the market’s Sept. 18, 2014 peak to the Oct. 15 low. But investors looking for a way to play the bounceback got it and then some. Shares of the company are up 32% from the bottom — creating $3.7 billion in market value.
Clearly, playing the bottom is risky business as many of the hammered stocks limped higher or still haven’t bounced back. First Solar (FSLR) is a example of a stock that’s in a downward trajectory that even a market bounceback hasn’t mended. Shares of the solar-panel company fell 26% during the market’s pullback. And from the market’s low, they’re down further still: 6.9%.
Catching the bottom, is seems, is very difficult. But oh, the rewards are so great when you do.

Americans dont wear contact lenses properly and it leads to about 1 million eye infections a yearBy Abby Phillip November 13 Follow @abbydphillip
(Suzanne Plunkett/Bloomberg News )
I'll be the first to admit it: I wear my contact lenses to bed most nights. I sometimes wear them longer than I'm supposed to. And on a few rare occasions, I've found myself nowhere near contact lens solution and used a little bit of water instead. (Shameful, I know!)
Bad contact glass wearer? That's me! If you are one of the estimated 38 million Americans who also wear contacts, it's probably you, too.
According to new numbers released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday, Americans make nearly 1 million doctors appointments and emergency room visits a year for eye infections -- most of them due to the improper use and care of contact lenses.
If you are a contact wearer, you know how easy it is to take short cuts.
Most people have found themselves in a tricky situation, where they have to deal with an errant lens with no contact solution in sight.
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
Not to mention that once you get away with sleeping in your contacts once, you'll probably do it again. ( Some lenses are approved for continuous, overnight wear , but even those should be removed whenever possible for cleaning and to let the eyes rest.)
But just because you can doesn't mean you should.
"People who wear contact lenses over night are more than 20 times more likely to get Keratitis," said Jennifer Cope a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. "Wearing contacts and not taking care of them properly is the single biggest risk factor for Keratitis."
Things happen, but the message from the CDC is that you should try to make them happen less often.
Keratitis is an eye infection of the cornea that is not at all pleasant. It occurs when germs invade the cornea, a clear dome that covers the colored part of the eye. It causes infection, pain, inflammation, scarring of the cornea and yes, it can lead to blindness.
Doctors can easily treat the infection, depending on how early it is diagnosed and what type of bacteria is causing it. But there can and are more serious health consequences.
Even some seemingly harmless behaviors can lead to infection -- like, for example, not replacing the contact case often enough. (The CDC recommends doing this every three months.)
And treating infection can be expensive: The CDC estimates that the cost of a doctor's visit for Keratitis is about $151 on average; each emergency room visit costs an average of $587. Overall in the United States, Keratitis is responsible for $175 million in direct costs.
Here are some other ways you can make your bad contact lens habits a little better, according to the CDC:
Wash hands with soap and water and dry well before touching contact lenses
Take contacts out before bed, showering or swimming
Rub and rinse contacts in disinfecting solution each time you remove them
Rub and rinse the case with contact lens solution, dry with a clean tissue and store upside down with the caps off after each use
Replace contact lens cases at least once every three months
Do not “top off” solution in lens case

UN chief asks Myanmar to act on RohingyaUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Myanmar's president Thursday to address citizenship concerns.
By: Associated Press | Naypyitaw | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:36 am
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Myanmar’s president Thursday to address citizenship concerns for members of the long-persecuted Rohingya Muslim community.
He also emphasised the need for improved humanitarian access and better cooperation with the United Nations as it tries to help.
The chief minister of Rakhine state, where most Rohingya live, rebuked Ban for referring to members of the religious minority by their name, Rohingya. Maung Maung Ohn said the word inflames tensions feeding sectarian violence.
Although many Rohingya families arrived in Myanmar generations ago, the government says all are migrants from neighboring Bangladesh and insists they be called “Bengali.” The United Nations and human rights organisations say the Rohingya have the right to self-identify.
Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist nation of 50 million, found itself on the defensive this week as world leaders flocked to capital, Naypyitaw for a series of regional summits.
Although the deteriorating condition for Rohingya was not brought up during the official talks, Ban and others expressed serious concerns in private with President Thein Sein.
The country’s 1.3 million Rohingya have been described by the United Nations as one of the world’s most persecuted minorities. They have been denied citizenship by the national government, and in the last two years have been hunted down by Buddhist extremists and chased from their homes. More than 140,000 live in crowded, unsanitary camps, unable to pass police checkpoints to leave without paying hefty bribes.
Their main medical lifeline, the Nobel prize-winning Doctors Without Borders, was kicked of the state eight months ago. The government indicated – as they have several times in the past – that the group would be allowed to return “soon,” possibly this week. But there were no immediate signs Thursday that was happening.
The operations of other aid groups have been severely curtailed by threats of violence at the hands of Buddhist extremists.

World s First Solar-Powered Bike Lane Installed In The NetherlandsThe Netherlands Gets The World's First Solar-Powered Bike Lane
City Lab  | By                                                                John Metcalfe

This story was originally published by City Lab and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
It's tough to make cycling any greener, but the Dutch have done just that with a bike lane that powers street lights and even houses.
What's being billed as the world's first solar-powered bike path will officially open on November 12 in Krommenie, a town northwest of Amsterdam. Riders will be able to hop on at one end and then, after a few seconds of pedaling, dismount at the other. Being a pilot project, the lane is only 230 feet long (though it'll stretch to 328 feet when finished).
The so-called SolaRoad is the result of a collaboration among the private sector, government, and academia. Here's a brief description of how it works:
The pilot road of just a hundred metres consists of concrete modules each of 2.5 by 3.5 metres. Solar cells are fitted in one travelling direction underneath a tempered glass top layer which is approximately 1-cm thick. There are no solar cells on the other side of the road and this is used to test various top layers. In time, the solar power from the road will be used for practical applications in street lighting, traffic systems, electric cars (which drive on the surface) and households.
Visually, the SolaRoad kind of looks like the glassy cooking element on an electric stove. It's outfitted with a friction-granting surface, though, so riders won't careen around on it like pinballs:
The green pathway has its drawbacks. Because it can't be angled toward the sun, it's less efficient than solar panels. And it's hugely expensive at an expected cost of $3.7 million. But as the technology advances these problems might diminish, allowing for some wild new uses to take center stage, reports the BBC :
Dr. Sten de Wit from SolaRoad, the consortium behind the project, envisages that solar roads could eventually be used to power the electric vehicles that use them.
"Electric vehicles are on the rise, but are not really a substitute until the electricity they use is generated in a sustainable way. Roads can generate power right where it is needed," de Wit explains in a publication for the contract research organisation TNO.
"Sensors gathering information about traffic circulation can help improve traffic management, or even allow automatic vehicle guidance," de Wit added.

EXPLAINED: Why Other People s Farts Are More Smelly Than Yoursreddit
So maybe you were too embarrassed to ask, but we're guessing you've been wondering why your flatulence is so much less offensive than that of other people.
It turns out that science has several explanations, according to a new video (above) from the YouTube series ASAPScience .
For starters, "the more familiar you are with something, whether it be a song, picture, or even a smell, the more likely you are to prefer it," series co-creator Mitchell Moffitt says in the video, "and because the bacterial population in your body producing these smells is completely unique from every other individual, our farts truly have a one-of-a-kind brand that your nose can differentiate."
And then there's the fact that others' farts can actually make you sick.
"There are many reported cases of farts spreading Streptococcus pyogenes , a pathogen that can cause tonsillitis, scarlet fever, heart disease, and even flesh-eating disease," Moffitt says in the video. "The pathogen is expelled as fecal matter or poop particles in the air... Of course, this was a major concern for our ancestors who ran around naked, but for us underwear or pant-wearing folks, farts don't pose a real threat."
You're welcome.

Sony introduces new cloud-based TV service PlayStation Vue
Sony Network Entertainment International LLC, a unit of Sony Corp of America, unveiled a new cloud-based TV service, PlayStation Vue, expected to be commercially launched during the first quarter of 2015.
The web-based television service allows users to access live TV and on-demand content without a cable or satellite service, the company said.
The service offers catch-up and on-demand TV. It makes the past three days of popular programming available without the need to schedule recordings, the company said.

The Big Climate Deal: What It Is  and What It Isn treddit
1) It is historic. John Kerry was right to use the phrase in his New York Times oped announcing the deal: for the first time a developing nation has agreed to eventually limit its emissions, which has become a necessity for advancing international climate negotiations.
2) It isn't binding in any way. In effect President Obama is writing an IOU to be cashed by future presidents and Congresses (and Xi is doing the same for future Politburos). If they take the actions to meet the targets, then it's meaningful, but for now it's a paper promise. And since physics is uninterested in spin, all the hard work lies ahead.
3) It is proof, if any more was needed, that renewable energy is ready to go. The Chinese say they'll be using clean sources to get 20 percent of their energy by 2030 -- which is not just possible, it should be easy. Which they know because they've revolutionized the production of solar energy, driving down the cost of panels by 90 percent or more in the last decade.
4) It is not remotely enough to keep us out of climate trouble. We've increased the temperature less than a degree and that's been enough to melt enormous quantities of ice, not to mention set the weather on berserk. So this plan to let the increase more than double is folly -- though it is good to see that the two sides have at least agreed not to undermine that two degrees target, the one tiny achievement of the Copenhagen conference fiasco.
5) It is a good way to put pressure on other nations. I've just come back from India, which has worked hard to avoid any targets of any sort. But the lesson from this pact is, actual world leaders at least need to demonstrate they're talking about climate; it makes the lead-up to the global negotiations in Paris next year more interesting.
6) It isn't a way for Obama to get off the hook on things like the Keystone pipeline. If he's serious about meeting these kinds of targets, then we need serious steps; the surest sign this is a talking point, not a serious commitment, would be to approve new pipelines or authorize new drilling. If you pledge sobriety and then buy a keg of beer, people are going to wonder.
7) It is a good reminder that fossil fuel investors should continue their flight to safety -- the burgeoning divestment movement has been arguing not just on moral grounds, but also making the point that the future will inevitably lead to a downsloping curve for the old energies. This is another warning -- for anyone who looks more than a few quarters out, the writing is on the wall.
8) It's not, in any way, a stretch goal. These numbers are easy -- if you were really being cynical, you could say they're trying to put a floor under the retreat from carbon, to manage a retreat from fossil fuels instead of really putting carbon on the run. The Germans, for instance, will be moving in on 60 percent of their energy from clean sources by the mid-2020s, when we'll still be cutting carbon emissions by small increments.
9) It is -- and this is the real key -- a reminder that movements work. President Obama first endorsed the 80 percent by 2050 goal he enshrined in this pact when he was running for president in 2007, a week after 1,400 demonstrations around the nation demanded that goal . This comes seven weeks after by far the largest global climate demonstrations in history , and amidst ongoing unrest in China about the filthy air in its cities.
10) It isn't, in other words, a reason to slack off a bit in the ongoing fight for a livable climate, a fight our civilizations are in great danger of losing. If we want this to be a start, and not a finish, we've got to build even bigger and more powerful movements that push the successors of these gentlemen to meet what science demands. Today's an achievement for everyone who's held a banner, signed a petition, and gone to jail -- and a call for many more to join us going forward!

How to Connect With Your Audience and Make an Impactreddit
Every brand must continue growing its user base, and sometimes it may seem an extremely daunting task. However, one proven approach includes instrumentally using your existing audience as a sales-driving platform. You may need to give up a bit of direct-to-consumer power, but your influencer-driven marketing message will be authentic.
Security software giant, Symantec, found that 60 to 65 percent of its customers are likely recommenders. Principal researcher at Microsoft Research, Duncan Watts, found the power of small groups of everyday people sharing information, leads to marketing success.
Keep in mind, the core to building up audiences and groups of influencers, includes having compelling content: content which will be passed on by your advocates, and shared.
What will motivate people to become advocates and share?
You must build up an army of advocates: those individuals are specialists in your field, yet not necessarily inside the usual confines of your business. Nonetheless, they're at the top of the content pyramid.
You'll have your general audience at the bottom who have a desire to share easy, quick content. For those individuals, the content must be fresh - in order for them to have the kudos of being the first to share. And why? Because on social, it is all ego-based. How will you share the best content? Who are you connected to? This is what will matter to individuals.
Newsletters: Friends or foes?
Newsletters. Bulletins. Emailer. Call them what you want, yet irrespective of name they must be highly focused. At the core, you must prove and show you understand the audience in the first place and customize the content to the audience's interests. According to the Nielsen Norman Group's Email Newsletter Usability report , it's not uncommon for readers to develop an emotional attachment to their email newsletters.
A fabulous blog post by Vertical Response, 7 Golden Steps to Creating an Effective Email Newsletter , outlines the essentials.
Get priorities straight
You must ask yourself if you understand your audience. Do you know what their interests include? What are they going to engage with? It is about dialogue, and company's must talk and engage with their audience, as well as make them feel like they are part of your 'story'.
Also, you should look at the timing of the newsletter. Thirty minutes too early might make all the difference to the open rates.
Social Impact
Growing your community with quirky, fun content includes one method of getting individuals into your brand. This said, you must make the first social interaction simplistic; next, build the interaction; and finally, reward their efforts.
Occasionally, a personal Twitter feed will work better than a branded feed; tweeting from faceless, anonymous organizations when you are attempting to engage individuals may be challenging. The parent brand that is tweeting about a service or product makes sense... yet the personal includes the experience and insight. "It's all about the personality, darlin'," writes Business2Community contributor, Chelsea Varney, who shares examples where having your own voice on Twitter helps brand-to-audience connection.
But, you must be careful concerning the 'personal' tweets that may not be aligned with the company view. Also, you must know how the audience perceives itself: if you aren't communicating on their wavelength, they will tune out.
Need to be innovative and creative and think outside the box
Discover different methods of engaging different kinds of audiences: there will include a lot of individuals who sit on the outside, and who additionally may be beyond your typical reach. For instance, you might tap into communities which are already self-organized, like meet-up groups and membership organizations. You must additionally bear in mind that lots of community interaction tends to occur on mobile - in a non-work environment and on the way home - so again, consider these times and attempt different things.
Figures/facts may be utilized to develop engaging content. Also, you might tap into the broader zeitgeist by reflecting what is occurring elsewhere. Never cease in experimenting... however! It must come back to evidence and statistics.
Take a "news hub" approach to creating content
First begin with the content concept, then work out where it'll go before developing it. This "news hub" or " reverse funnel " approach allows you to focus promotion goals in the early stages of content development. It forces you to concentrate your campaign to meet the needs of different audiences and distribution through the right influencers.
Hold in person events
In San Francisco, we recently hosted an LG event to launch the new LG OLED TV. I can tell you all about it because I saw it in person.
The in-person experience allows me to share levels of detail I remember because I have a collection of memories around it. Like how the blacks were truly black , the colors were truly vibrant and the 160 degree visibility was amazing.  I even remember I liked the LG 65" OLED TV is 4,000 pixels better than the Samsung equivalent. Details I would only remember through experience.

13 Disturbing Facts About Employee Engagement [Infographic]reddit
Last year, I had a viral post about some of the downfalls in employee engagement . Unfortunately, not much has changed and there are still some things around employee engagement that need to be fixed.
In the past year, not much has changed, but we have managed to do is reinvent employee surveys  in order to help provide high-level management with statistics to boost employee morale. So I'm proud to say that we're making strides in the right direction to better offices across the world.
I would also like to add that you don't think that engaging employees is a big deal, you should probably checkout this employee engagement calculator that shows how much money is saved by having happy, engaged employees.
First, let us educate with some disturbing facts around employee engagement:
This infographic was crafted with love by Officevibe, the employee survey tool that helps companies improve their corporate wellness, and have a better organizational culture.
1. No Passion For Work
88% of employees don't have passion for their work.
Let's face it, there's employees that absolutely love their job and there are employees that are there just to collect checks.  Passion for a job is far more important than being engaged.
So for nearly 90% of the workforce to openly admit that they don't have passion for their career kind of shows where employee engagement epidemic lies. Companies need to get a better understanding of what drives their employees and allows them to love their job.
There's a whole lot of research and  science behind employee engagement and being passionate about work. Employers need to do a better job of understanding and applying some of the research in order to create better workplaces.
2. Do Managers Enjoy Their Job?
Only 20% of senior managers are passionate about their work.
Having a leader or manager that isn't passionate about their work can definitely lead to bad results, in terms of employee productivity.
The last thing a manager wants is to be considered that " horrible boss " that no one likes working for. In order to avoid this, leadership has to really dive deep into HR analytics   and see what are the needs of the managers, along with the employees.
Once you create that synergy between management and employees, work becomes fun.
3. Employee Disengagement Is Costing The US Billions!
Employee Disengagement Is Costing The US $500 Billion Per Year
We talk a lot about employee engagement and its importance on company profits, and this statistics proves how important engagement truly is.
Employees that don't get the recognition and respect from managers that they deserve, will become disengaged and not want to work hard.
I put the link above the employee engagement ROI calculator, I would highly suggest you check it out and see how much money your company can save by having engaged employees.
4. So Many Distractions!
57% of interruptions at work come from either social media tools or switching between applications.
Social networks aren't a bad thing. They've done a lot for society, and we've even ventured out to say that they should be allowed in every workplace. As long as it's not taking away that much time from work, is being used to learn new things (I follow A LOT of HR and News Publications, so I go on there a couple times of days just to see what's happening and recent news + trends), and that it's being done to have some downtime .
I would recommend individuals having tools like RescueTime  in order to limit their distractions and find a good workflow. It's vital to find a good balance between leisure time and work time.
5. The Government Doesn't Have Engagement Right
Employees working in government reported the lowest rate of engagement.
That's a shocking line, I hope it didn't offend anyone working for the government, but the data from recent studies show that government employees aren't engaged.
There are even books that have surfaced online that have been written to specifically help out government employees become engaged. I would highly recommend that government officials do more to make their employees happier, as it will allow for better work to be done .
6. Where's The Leadership?
86% of businesses and HR leaders believe they don't have an adequate leadership pipeline.
I think this statistic proves that there's still a lack of transparency within many workplaces across the globe. HR is basically in the front line of hiring, so when they feel that leadership is flawed, it will not allow them to do their job properly.
We've had talks about transparent cultures with our friends at Buffer, check out the Culturetalk here:
The fact of the matter is, if you have great leaders  employees feel empowered and motivated to provide better results for that person. Just as a wild example, would you want to promise a new hire that they'll be working amongst great leaders, when the head honchos act like Cruella De Vil? Wow, I never thought I would use a Disney reference.
7. Employee Retention Is A Problem
79% believe they have a significant  employee retention and engagement problem.
We've done a lot of research on employee retention  and none of the statistics have proved to be good ones. As we mentioned earlier, a lot of people aren't passionate about what they do and they are considered to be disengaged employee .
So the problems still exist, and the worst part is that productivity is getting higher. So employees are naturally feeling more stressed out and wanting to leave their job for what may seem to be a better opportunity.
8. The Laws Of Hiring Attraction
75% are struggling to attract and recruiting the top people they need.
It's hard to hire and retain talent , especially if a company is not committed to improving its company culture. Companies are genuinely trying to find great talent, and it may not be that the talent isn't there, it might be that they're not a good cultural fit .
A bad hire (especially for a smaller company) can end up being devastating for morale . So start doing your best to promote your core values within your site or throughout your hiring process, so that any new hires, or people looking at your company, understand where your company is coming from, and why you guys do what you do.
9. Be Transparent With Your Company's Story
Only 17% feel they have a compelling and engaging employment brand.
We recently had a webinar where we talked about this with the folks over at Entelo. Jacob Shriar, discussed the importance of having a good brand and story around your company. The fact of the matter is, society isn't as greedy, or as money hungry as it is portrayed to be.
People want to work and feel like they have a greater purpose whenever they go into work every single day. So share the story of your office and how much you've grown in the past couple of years. Let all new hires know that your brand and your office is a great place.
10. Is Managing Performance Important?
Only 6% believe their current process for managing performance is worth the time.
This is something that we pride ourselves whenever we do research. Finding a way to manage employee performance is next on our platform's list of ideas. This has to be the way of the future, and managers have to start buying into it.
Be able to recognize your employees' strengths, weaknesses, and delegate tasks in an good enough fashion that everyone is truly working to the best of their abilities.
11. No More Overworking Employees
2/3 of today's employees feel "overwhelmed."
You often hear people say that they feel overworked and underpaid, it's mostly because they are. There's no sugar coating it.
People are given so many tasks to do regularly that high stress levels are becoming common and it's becoming the norm across all offices. I would have to blame two parties, the management for not handling things better, and the employee for being a little too shy to say no, or that they can't. I know, sometimes it's hard to say no, but if there's a hundred things to do, you have to prioritize better and let a manager know the penalties that may come with moving a task list around.
12. 40 Hour Workweeks Coming To An End?
50% of adults work more than 40 hours per week.
This is something that people across the globe are just beginning to realize. That working 40 hours a week isn't that productive . Some companies are having 4 day workweeks , there's even rumors of a 3 day workweek (which even I think is a little too crazy).
Working 40 hours isn't good for work-life balance, it isn't good for creativity, nor is it good for employee happiness. The real move would be to have people make sure they get enough sleep and  work with their energy ; instead of looking at the clock every minute, they'll be working faster and smarter.
13. Work Smart, Not Hard
80% would like to work fewer hours.
Well, I think this number is a little low. Even people who absolutely love their job would probably want to work fewer hours. But I get it. People feel overworked!
As I mentioned earlier, a lot of companies are squeezing the productivity and happiness out of their employees. They make them work crazy hours, or even worse, the employees becoming so infatuated with their work that they end up working longer hours.
Remember one thing, working longer hours doesn't make your more productive . So keep a fresh mind and make sure that you're working with your energy! It will benefit you as an employee and as a person.
If we can improve these 13 things, we will be able to create happier, healthier, and more productive workplaces across the globe. First thing is first, we'll do our job here at Officevibe to help managers create better workplaces and give employees a voice within their organization with our nifty employee survey tool.

What Does Your Courage Look Likereddit
So here we are.  Halloween over.  Election Day over.  Veteran's Day here.  And all I can think about is:  Courage.
A friend of mine was telling me about her four-year-old son and his trick-or-treating escapades.  She shared how he (dressed as a Skylander  -- I know, I didn't know what that was either) and two of his little friends (Olaf the Snowman and Mr. Panda Bear) would gingerly and tentatively walk up to each home.  Olaf would take the lead, and they would ever-so-slowly make their way up to the front step.  Once there, they had to dig deep within themselves to actually knock on the door.  Still, no relief from their fear.  Not quite yet.  Filled with hope-against-hope, they would stand there praying that no one would scare them once the door actually opened.  She said you could see that actually speaking the words "Trick-or-treat!" were a relief because they'd done the hard part.
And this is how it went with every. single. house.
But the reward...oh, the reward...was SO worth it!
Candy.  Bushels of it.
Over the past few weeks, I have led several panel discussions on (gasp) RACE in front of large audiences.  If you're like 99 percent of the rest of the population in our country, just hearing the words "race discussion" stops you in your tracks like a deer in headlights.
People ask me how I do it.  How I lead those hard discussions.  As in, "Aren't you nervous, Trudy?"  or "Oh Trudy, I could never do that.  You're so much braver than I could ever be." And then, "Talking about race is so hard. I don't even know where or how to begin."
But like our little trick-or-treaters, I had to be bold.  I had to step out.  I had to do it afraid.  I had to dig deep and let my courage lead me.
Why?  Because it's time for courage like we've never had or seen before.  Leading the race discussion at your organization, starting the courageous conversation, running for office and getting defeated, all of it and more.  The more we do it, the less power it has over us.  The less fear we feel.
It's time to be the "difference of one" where you are.  Right now.  To let your courage - not your fear - lead you.
I recently read an interview from author/journalist, Nicholas Kristof.  It touched something deep in my soul.  And we all have stories like this that we could share.  Those stories of how one person made a difference in our life...
When people scoff and say individual charitable acts are "drops in the bucket, I push back," said Mr. Kristof, citing the case of the World War II refugee from Romania who was taken in by an Oregon family.
The refugee happened to be his father.
"They didn't solve the refugee problem around the world, but for my dad it was transformative. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for that drop in the bucket. That's how buckets get filled, drop by drop by drop."
Drop by drop by drop...YES.  Every courageous conversation.  Drop.  Every hard discussion on race with your team or even with your family members.  Drop.  Every election (even when your candidate loses).  Drop.
With courage, the bucket CAN get filled.  But we must, must, MUST step out into it.  Let it lead.  Let it guide.  Let it win.
On days like Veteran's Day, we celebrate the obvious and outright courage of our veterans.  Of those who risked, continue to risk or GAVE their lives for our sake.  It is easy for us to see and identify their courage.  And to be oh-so-thankful.  Beyond thankful, in fact.
But now it's time to...
Let your courage be seen.  Let yourself and others know what your courage looks like.  And, like our trick-or-treaters, reap the rewards of your courage.  Because there ARE rewards...for yourself, for those closest to you and even for those you don't even know.
If you haven't yet watched Mellody Hobson's TED Talk, Color Blind or Color Brave , take a few minutes to watch it right now .
I can think of no better way to end than with her words:
"I'm asking you to show courage. I'm asking you to be bold. As business leaders, I'm asking you not to leave anything on the table. As citizens, I'm asking you not to leave any child behind. I'm asking you not to be color blind, but to be color brave, so that every child knows that their future matters and their dreams are possible."

Islamic State leader urges attacks in Saudi ...Islamic State leader urges attacks in Saudi Arabia: Speech
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 10.22PM IST
(The speech was not dated…)
BEIRUT: Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called for attacks in Saudi Arabia, said his caliphate was expanding across the Arab world, and called for "volcanoes of jihad" in a speech purported to be in his name on Thursday.
Baghdadi also said a U.S.-led military campaign against his group in Syria and Iraq was failing. Reuters could not independently confirm the authenticity of the speech, which was carried on jihadist websites.
There have been contradictory accounts out of Iraq following U.S. air strikes on Friday about whether Baghdadi was wounded in a raid. The United States said on Tuesday it could not confirm whether he was killed or wounded in Iraq following a strike near the city of Falluja.
The speech was not dated but carried a reference to a Nov. 7 U.S. announcement that President Barack Obama had approved sending up to 1,500 more U.S. troops to Iraq.
"O sons of al-Haramayn (Saudi Arabia)...the serpent's head and the stronghold of the disease are there...draw your swords and divorce life, because there should be no security for the Saloul," Baghdadi said, using a derogatory term to refer to the leadership of Saudi Arabia.
Islamic State has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq, declaring a caliphate over territory it controls in June. Baghdadi said he had accepted oaths of allegiance from supporters in Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Algeria.
"Oh soldiers of the Islamic State...erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere. Light the earth with fire against all dictators," Baghdadi said.
Referring to U.S.-led military action against his group, he said: "Despite this Crusade campaign being the most fierce and severe of all, it is the greatest failure."
"We see America and its allies stumbling in fear, weakness, impotence and failure."

How brave investors made $12.8 billion in a monthHow brave investors made $12.8B in a month

Investors know real money is made when others are fearful. That’s even more true when they buy the right stocks that scare investors the most.
Scooping up the seven stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 that cratered 20% during the market’s freakout in late September and early October and raced back with a vengeance — including energy firms Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Newfield (NFX) in addition to tech firm Microchip Technology (MCHP) — turned out to be extremely lucrative for brave investors. These stocks are all up more than 10% from the market’s Ebola-panic induced bottom on Oct. 15 — creating $12.8 billion in market value.
Such breathtaking bouncebacks are a reminder of the impressive money-making power of having nerves of steel during times of market trouble — but also a a huge helping of luck. Here’s why. Investors actually had much better odds simply buying the market itself at the bottom and riding it higher. Of the 21 S&P 500 stocks that dropped 20% or more during the market decline — 14 of them actually bounced back less than the market’s 9.4% gain.
Still, the big winner from the beat down is Chesapeake Energy. Shares of the energy exploration company tanked 28% from the market’s Sept. 18, 2014 peak to the Oct. 15 low. But investors looking for a way to play the bounceback got it and then some. Shares of the company are up 32% from the bottom — creating $3.7 billion in market value.
Clearly, playing the bottom is risky business as many of the hammered stocks limped higher or still haven’t bounced back. First Solar (FSLR) is a example of a stock that’s in a downward trajectory that even a market bounceback hasn’t mended. Shares of the solar-panel company fell 26% during the market’s pullback. And from the market’s low, they’re down further still: 6.9%.
Catching the bottom, is seems, is very difficult. But oh, the rewards are so great when you do.

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd received its first debt ratings from international credit agencies on Thursday after the company announced plans for an issue of senior unsecured notes to raise an unspecified amount.
Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings rated the notes at investment grade "A-plus", while Moody's Investor Service assigned an equivalent "A1" rating.
Alibaba said it would use the net proceeds from the U.S. bond offering primarily to refinance debt.

Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway Inc buys Procter & Gamble Co s DuracellBerkshire Hathaway to acquire Duracell battery from Procter & Gamble in $4.7 billion stock deal

("Duracell will have about…)
NEW YORK: Berkshire Hathaway agreed to buy the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble in chairman Warren Buffett's latest stock swap. Berkshire will turn over $4.7 billion of P&G shares held by Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based company, according to a Business Wire statement on Thursday.
Duracell will have about $1.7 billion in cash when the deal is completed, which is expected in the second half of next year, according to the statement. The exchange may help Berkshire cut its holding in Cincinnati-based P&G without incurring the tax costs of selling shares in the open market.
Buffett became one of P&G's biggest shareholders through an investment in Gillette. P&G bought the razor maker in 2005 in a $57-billion deal that the Berkshire chairman supported.
Berkshire held more than 100 million shares as recently as 2008 and cut the stake several times since then as the company faltered under previous CEO Bob McDonald. "I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette," Buffett said in the statement.
P&G announced last month that it would divest Duracell. CEO AG Lafley has been streamlining the company, cutting expenses and selling noncore businesses. P&G sold its pet-food business and has said it will jettison up to 100 of its slower-selling brands. Paying with shares would mirror two of Buffett's transactions in the past year, when he swapped stock that had appreciated for operating businesses.
He handed over a holding in Phillips 66 in February in exchange for its pipeline-flowimprover unit. In July, he swapped a stake in former Washington Post publisher, Graham Holdings , for cash, a Miami TV station and Berkshire stock that Graham held. Buffett had about 52 million P&G shares at the end of last year, a stake worth more than $4 billion.

Volkswagen's new-generation Golf models are the Motor Trend Car of the Year winner, the automaker and the publicatin announced today.
It's another in an unusually strong award showing by the latest Golf models. They are VW's best-sellers worldwide, but have been only mid-pack among VW's sold in the U.S.
The brand is hoping the new design, new drivetrain, and now the growing list of awards, will boost the Golf's appeal and sales here.
The Motor Trend award is to the Golf 'family' of cars, which includes the GTI high-performanc model on sale since spring, and the rest of the line that went on sale after that.
The other models include a diesel, a gasoline-power car and an electric e-Golf.
VW next year adds the 292-horsepower, all-wheel-drive Golf R and the Golf SportWagen, previously sold as the Jetta SportWagen.
Motor Trend's COTY award is among the best-known and becomes a useful and -- the industry believes -- powerful marketing tool. Such so-callled "third party" awards are assumed to be more persuasive than car companies' own advertising.
The GTI version of Golf won the Cars.com/USA TODAY/MotorWeek Cheap Speed Challenge in July,
COMPARISON: Cheap Speed Challnege won by VW GTI
Among the most respected thrid-party awards are the North American Car and Truck of the Year trophies. Those are given by a panel of several dozen auto writers and editors, rather than being affiliated with a single publication.
The NACTOY organization is self-supporting through dues paid by the jurors. The North American Car and Truck hardware is handed out at the Detoir auto show each January.
The Golf is on the organization's list of candidates.

SC summons MP chief secy over missingkidsPrint
Written by Aneesha Mathur | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:14 am
The Supreme Court Thursday has directed the Chief Secretary of Madhya Pradesh to appear personally on the next date of hearing after noting that the state had not filed any details on the number of “missing” children or the number of children recovered despite court orders.
During a hearing on the PIL filed by the Bachpan Bachao Andolan regarding missing children in the country, the bench of Chief Justice of India H L Dattu, Justice Madan B Lokur and Justice A K Sikri took note of data submitted by senior advocate H S Phoolka, appearing on behalf of the NGO. According to Phoolka, who got the data from the website of National Crime Records Bureau, over 23,000 children had gone missing in Madhya Pradesh since 2011. Of these, over 11,000 children went missing in 2013 alone.
The court then ruled, “Chief Secretary be present and file affidavit on number of missing children and the number of children traced”.
The Chief Secretaries and Directors General of Police for Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Assam were also directed to trace within four weeks the “missing” children as per their affidavits.
The affidavit filed by the Bihar government stated that it had traced 169 “missing” children in one week after the directions issued by the Supreme court on October 30. Over 460 children were still “missing” in Bihar.
For Assam, the number of “missing children” is over 2000, while Chhattisgarh has informed the court that over 1300 children remain untraced in the state.

Haryana may rope in Batra as education panelheadPrint
By: Express News Service | Chandigarh | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:13 am
The Haryana government is learnt to be planning to rope in RSS-backed Shiksha Bachao Andolan convenor Dinanath Batra to suggest “necessary” changes in the school education system. Batra, a controversial educationist, is responsible for the pulping of American scholar Wendy Doniger’s book on Hinduism, alleging that it hurt religious sentiments. of the community.
State Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma said the government was planning to constitute a consultative committee to improve education levels. That committee is likely to be headed by Batra, sources said.
“There is a dire need to improve the standard of education in the state. The Congress has spoilt the educational atmosphere by introducing unscientific methods. We have decided to constitute a consultative committee and will implement its suggestions,” Sharma, who himself once worked as a teacher with Batra in Kurukshetra, said in a press release Thursday. He added that eminent educationists would also be included in the panel.
Sharma also said the government would try and make education “traditional and culture based” at the school level.

Wonder kids 14: a climber  a magician and aninnovatorFive-year-old Satvik, who does magic shows to spread awareness about the specially-abled.
Written by Abantika Ghosh | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:12 am
Nine-year-old Aaryan Balaji has set high goals for himself, literally. Aaryan, who became the youngest child to climb to the Everest base camp in 2012, wants to scale the world’s tallest peak in 2017. He is one of the 20 children President Pranab Mukherjee will felicitate on Friday with national child awards.
Among the others who will get the awards are a five-year-old magician who does shows to spread awareness about disability and a Class IX student who designed a jacket that would keep a biker cool in the summer heat.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Aaryan, son of an officer in the Navy, spoke of the tough training he undergoes to realise his ambition.
“I walk 10-15 km every day and cycle for 5-10 km. At the base camp, I saw how people train to reach the top. I also climbed Kalapatthar which is nearly 5554 metres high. I have also scaled Mount Kilimanjaro,” he said.
Aaryan has also represented India in the World Unicycle Championship in Canada and has been featured in several advertisements and films.
For 5-year-old Satvik, who grew up watching the anguish of his specially-abled uncle, magic is a medium to spread the message that those like his uncle need care and compassion.
Asked what his magic shows are about, he replied: “Mental retardation”. Satvik’s family is now busy preparing for a new
show based on Swacch Bharat theme, said his father Suresh Nayak.
Fifteen-year-old Masirabi Hanif Patel of Bhusawal will be awarded for coming up with an ‘AC’ for bikers.
“(During summer) I saw my father very uncomfortable on his two wheeler while those in cars stayed cool. I started thinking why can’t there be an AC in a two-wheeler. So I designed a jacket that keeps a biker cool,” she said.
The Class IX student has earlier received an award for innovation from former President A P J Abdul Kalam.
Each awardee will get a silver medal, a certificate and a cheque of Rs 10,000. Four institutions and three individuals are also being given national awards for child welfare and three others will get the Rajiv Gandhi Manav Seva award.

Sreedharan set to return toRailwaysSreedharan has been asked to give an interim report in two weeks and then a final report within a period not exceeding three months.
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:07 am
E Sreedharan — popular as the ‘Metro man’ — is set to make a comeback to his erstwhile parent organisation, Indian Railways. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has named Sreedharan as the head of a “one-man committee” to chalk out for the national transporter a proper system and procedure to ensure accountability and transparency.
The order for the 82-year old Sreedharan was issued by Rail Bhawan on Thursday. In his individual capacity, Sreedharan is free to co-opt anyone he chooses to work out strategies/procedures for General Managers and other functionaries for taking all commercial decisions, including that of tendering.
This comes right after Prabhu made it categorically clear to the Railway Board that files for tendering and procurement should not come to the minister at all. One of the terms of reference for the Sreedharan “committee” is to help Railways put in place a system that enables delegation of such responsibilities to GMs.
Sreedharan has been asked to give an interim report in two weeks and then a final report within a period not exceeding three months. The committee has also been empowered to recommend a professional organisation to be engage, if necessary, to achieve this goal.
“The committee would suggest the system and procedure and a manual of instruction to be followed to implement the above. The Management Information System to be used for proper and time-bound disposal of the cases,” the order says.
Sreedharan’s last assignment with Railways was as one of the members of the High-Level Safety Review Committee headed by Anil Kakodkar in 2012. As the first Managing Director, he is best known for building the Delhi Metro and running it as an efficient transport system. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2001, and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.

Police mute voice of J&KseparatistsPrint
Written by Bashaarat Masood | Srinagar | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:02 am
The Jammu and Kashmir police have either detained or restricted the movements of most separatist leaders, who invariably issue a boycott call during polls. The separatists say that by denying them a level playing field, the government has conceded defeat.
Syed Ali Shah Geelani, chairman of the Hurriyat’s hardline faction, is under house detention, while leaders of his group are behind bars to to prevent them for campaigning for a boycott. Police have been deployed outside the house of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the moderate faction. And activists Yasin Malik, Shabir Shah and Nayeem Khan have all been detained.
“The message is loud and clear: nobody will be allowed to create any kind of disturbance (during the elections),” Kashmir’s IGP Abdul Gani Mir said.
Geelani has called for boycott of a number of polls. This time, moderate separatists too have called for a boycott. In the past, they would term the elections a non-issue. This, police sources say, is one of the reasons for the crackdown. In the parliamentary polls, many people had skipped voting.
The separatists call the police action their “first victory”. “The government is denying a level playing field to us,” says Mirwaiz. “By arresting Hurriyat leaders and cadres, the government has already conceded defeat”.
Mirwaiz adds, “One has to understand that for India, elections are a democratic process. But that democracy and those democratic rights are altogether missing in Kashmir,” he said. “To call for a boycott or to campaign for it peacefully are a democratic right but the Indian state has no respect for opposition.”
Geelani echoed: “This has exposed India and these so-called elections. It is not a democracy, it is a farce. First they choke opposition voices and then conduct elections. It shows that India is not a democracy”.

Machil fake encounter: Macchil: life term for 5 Army menimprisonment
Court-martial finds them guilty in encounter case
The Army on Thursday sentenced five of its personnel, including two officers, to life imprisonment for staging the killing of three Kashmiri civilians in the Macchil area of Kupwara district in 2010 and branding them as foreign militants for rewards and remunerations.
Those sentenced by the Army’s summary general court martial are the then Commanding Officer of 4 Rajput regiment, Col. Dinesh Pathania, Captain Upendra Singh, havildar Davender, lance naik Lakhmi and lance naik Arun Kumar.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah welcomed the decision, calling it a “watershed moment.”
On April 30, 2010, Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Mohammad Shafi Lone and Riyaz Ahmad Lone, all residents of Nadihal in Sopore, were lured to work as porters for the Army on the promise of high wages.
They were later killed in a staged encounter and passed off as foreign militants.
Let Macchil sentence serve as warning: Omar
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the sentencing of five Army men in the Macchil fake encounter case, in which three Kashmiri civilians were killed and branded as foreign militants, should serve as a warning to those security personnel who may want to target innocent persons.
“No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases. Faith in institutions had disappeared. I hope that we never ever see such Macchil fake encounter type of incidents again & let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try,” Mr. Abdullah tweeted.
An Army court concluded its inquiry into the Macchil case in September and its sentence has now been sent to the Northern Army Commander for formal approval. If approved, all the five personnel will be imprisoned. The process may take a couple of months.
Reacting to the sentence, the mother of one of the victims called the convicted Army men murderers. “My son went once [to work for the Army] and was paid Rs. 500 for a day’s work. That amount was three times the money he usually earned. So when he was asked to come again, he willingly went but it was all a plan to murder him. It was not that they killed my son in anger or by mistake, they murdered him,” Naseema Bano, the mother of Riyaz Ahmad Lone told The Hindu.

Human rights organisations such as the Amnesty International welcomed the decision and said it indicated commitment to justice for human rights violations in Kashmir. Local rights organisations, which have been working on cases of staged killings, said the judgment should not be used to whitewash other cases.
“We hope this case will not be used as a whip to silence the critics of AFSPA and whitewash hundreds of human rights violations like Kunan-Poshpora mass rape, Pathribal killings and Badar Payeen killings in which the Army is still in a denial mode,” said Parvez Imroz, a human rights lawyer who heads the Coalition of Civil Society in Kashmir.
The Macchil fake encounter triggered the 2010 mass protests in Kashmir in which a large number of civilians took to the streets, demanding the right to self-determination. More than 120 young, unarmed protesters were killed in police firing during the protests.

How Wikipedia reading habits can successfully predict the spread of diseaseBy Elahe Izadi November 13 Follow @ElaheIzadi
(Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images)
The ability to forecast the spread of an infectious diseases weeks in advance can make a world of difference when it comes to public health responses. For decades, scientists have been trying to create models to predict how something like the flu will spread.
People's Internet usage has opened a new door for predictive data. There are already some tools out there, such as Google Trends, which tries to "nowcast," or show what's happening right now with the spread of certain diseases in the world. There have been studies, too, on whether Twitter can accurately predict how a disease is spreading.
But getting access to Google Trends or Twitter data is not always easy -- or cheap. So a team of mathematicians, biologists and computer scientists got together to see if they could use something that's completely open and free: Wikipedia.
As it turns out, they could accurately forecast how influenza and dengue spread based purely on people's reading habits of Wikipedia articles. Last week, they showed how their algorithm could predict flu season in the United States. The full results of their research are published in this week's PLOS Computational Biology .
"Nowcasting is cool, but ideally you want to provide information to public health departments and policymakers so they can plan ahead of time," said Sara Del Valle, a project leader at Los Alamos National Laboratory whose team worked on the study. "Because if you really want to make a difference in how people are treated when they come to clinics and hospitals, it's better for them to be prepared. If they know in advance, we will see people in a couple of weeks, four weeks, they can better prepare."
Researchers looked at seven diseases and 11 countries over a period of three years, starting in 2010, and compared page views on Wikipedia articles about those diseases to official data from health ministries. By looking at readers' habits, they successfully predicted the spreads of influenza in the United States, Poland, Thailand and Japan and dengue in Brazil and Thailand at least 28 days in advance.
Official government data -- usually released with a one- or two-week lag time -- lagged four weeks behind Wikipedia reading habits, according to Del Valle; people, she said, are probably reading about the illnesses they have before heading to the doctor.
But not all the diseases or countries yielded such results; they couldn't predict slow-progressing diseases like HIV/AIDS, or diseases with very small numbers of victims, such as Ebola (before the current outbreak) in Uganda or the plague in the United States. Seasonal diseases were much easier to forecast using the Wikipedia model.
And the study had other limitations; for instance, researchers used language as a proxy for country (Japanese articles about influenza were used to predict the spread of the disease in Japan). That may work for some languages, but for some more widely spoken ones, like English, it can be trickier.
Even still, researchers were able to accurately predict the spread of influenza in the United States by examining the page views for English Wikipedia articles. They hope they can next get country-specific data from Wikipedia.
They found that their model was transferable, meaning they could use data in one country to forecast the spread of a disease in another. The team has made its algorithm and coding free for all to use, and Del Valle said there could be many more uses for Wikipedia data.
"That was our main goal: people could go and replicate what we did," Del Valle said. "Not only replicate, but also improve."

India-ASEAN
For peace and stability in South China Sea, everyone should follow international norms and law, Mr Modi said
Against the backdrop of China’s raging maritime disputes with some southeast Asian countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said all nations have a responsibility to follow international law and norms on maritime issues and hoped for an early conclusion of a code of conduct to resolve the matter.
After making a passing reference to maritime disputes in general and the need for following international norms in his opening remarks at the 12th India-ASEAN summit, Mr. Modi delved on the South China Sea dispute in a little more detail in his closing statement.
“For peace and stability in South China Sea, everyone should follow international norms and law. This includes the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We also hope that you will be able to successfully implement the Guidelines to the 2002 Declaration on Conduct and that the Code of Conduct on South China Sea can be concluded soon on the basis of consensus,” he said at the end of the summit deliberations.
“We (India and ASEAN) are both keen to enhance our cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region,” Mr. Modi said.
“And, in this world, maritime trade and passage, and therefore, maritime security has become even more important.
We all have the responsibility that we all follow international law and norms on maritime issues, as we do in the realm of air passage. In future, we will also need this in space,” he added.
Though Mr. Modi did not name any country but the comments may be seen as targeting China which is engaged in maritime territorial disputes with a number of its neighbours, including Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines.
During his recent U.S. visit, Mr. Modi and President Barack Obama had pledged to intensify cooperation in maritime security to ensure freedom of navigation in comments that came against the backdrop of China’s expanding maritime ambitions.
They had stressed the importance of safeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and over flight throughout the region especially in the South China Sea.
During his Japan visit as well, Mr. Modi had deplored the “expansionist” tendency among some countries which “encroach” upon seas of others, in oblique comments against China which also has a maritime dispute with Japan over islands in the East China Sea.
ASEAN comprises 10 countries — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Wall Street touches new record | Oil tumbles below $79Dow Jones
(US stocks advanced modestly…)
NEW YORK: US stocks advanced modestly on Thursday to send the Dow and S&P to new record intraday highs following earnings from Wal-Mart and data on the labor market.
Wal-Mart shares climbed 3.4 percent to $81.92 as one of the biggest boosts to both the Dow and S&P 500 after the retail giant posted a 2.9 percent increase in third-quarter revenue.
Weekly initial jobless claims rose to 290,000, above expectations for 280,000 claims, but remained near a 14-year low, and stood below the 300,000 mark for a ninth straight week.
The Dow and S&P 500 had ended slightly lower on Wednesday to break a five-day streak of record closing highs, while the Nasdaq managed to advance. While stocks have rallied of late, moved have been modest, with the S&P 500 yet to post a gain of more than 1 percent this month.
"It's great to see stocks going up, but at the same time investors are troubled about something, and what they are a little bit troubled about is valuation," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York.
"That's why you get this creep higher, not euphoria."
The S&P 500 has rallied more than 9 percent from a six-month low in October, buoyed by supportive economic data and corporate earnings. For the year so far, it is up 10.6 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.93 points, or 0.49 percent, to 17,698.13, the S&P 500 gained 6.6 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,044.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.12 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,701.26.

G20 Day Zero: Prime Minister to meet Cameron  dine withAbePrint
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | Brisbane | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:40 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make the most of a public holiday declared by Brisbane on Friday and meet at least two global leaders — David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, during the day at the summit venue and Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, over dinner, a day ahead of the Group of 20 (G20) summit on November 15-16. He will simultaneously kick off the India-Australia bilateral with a visit to the Queensland University of Technology in the forenoon.
Modi arrives in Brisbane straight from Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar where he was present for the ASEAN and East Asia Summit. The Prime Minister’s visit to Australia for the two-day G20 Summit will mark his debut presence at a big ticket multilateral fora and will be followed by bilateral talks with Premier Tony Abbott in Canberra.
His Australia visit has a strong business and commerce agenda, but the Prime Minister will showcase several other facets of relationship including education and skills, culture and tourism, and defence.
“An Indian Prime Minister is visiting Australia after 28 years. The agenda is balanced, and comprehensive,” an Australian government official said, not willing to be quoted.
“In Brisbane, he will meet business persons, including those from the resources sector, and in Melbourne leading Australian CEOs,” another local government official, liasioning with the Indian delegation said. Modi is keen to get a larger pie of institutional investment from Australia. “Australia is the third largest institutional invest or with resources of $3 trillion-plus,” the official added.
At the G20 meeting, Modi is expected to make a strong pitch for growth accompanied with creation of jobs, infrastructure funding for developing countries, resolution of taxation in the specific context of BEPS (base erosion and profit sharing), larger voice in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and India’s own commitment to contribute significantly to the additional 2 per cent growth that global leaders are seeking.
Modi’s statements in such a multilateral fora will also assume significance since the purview of G20, whose members account for almost 85 per cent of global output, has gradually expanded over the last six years. From just fighting the global economic crisis of 2008, it has over the last six years progressed to include world trade, climate change and energy.
Ahead of the summit, India and the US also achieved a breakthrough in the WTO talks, with New Delhi finally agreeing to be party to the Trade Facilitation Agreement.
An Indian Prime Minister will visit this continent after almost three decades, and Modi hopes to unravel various dimension of India’s relationship with the Down Under. Similar to his visit to the United States, Modi will reach out to the 4,50,000-strong Indian diaspora in Australia. At the policy level, he will demand for a sharp cut in the costs of remittances for NRIs who send money back to India.
The Indian diaspora has gone the extra mile to recreate New York’s Madison Square event in Australia too. He will address people of Indian origin in Sydney’s Melbourne Cricket Ground, continued…

Behind tough talk  balancing athomePrint
Written by Harish Damodaran | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:36 am
By getting the US to agree to a “permanent solution” addressing India’s concerns over farm subsidies and public procurement linked to food security, the government has effectively rebuffed critics who claimed that its rigid stance had left the country isolated at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
But behind this tough exterior posturing — which has seemingly paid off, with the US and India reaching an understanding that the latter’s food security programmes should not be challenged at the WTO “until a permanent solution… has been agreed and adopted” — is also some pragmatic internal rebalancing of policy.
To begin with, the new government has been more conservative in fixing the minimum support price (MSP) for crops. The MSPs for both paddy and wheat this year have been raised by a mere Rs 50 per quintal. The average annual increase during the previous UPA regime’s tenure from 2004-05 to 2013-14 was Rs 76 per quintal for paddy and Rs 77 for wheat.
More radical, however, are two other measures.
The first is a crackdown on the practice of states declaring bonuses over and above the Centre’s MSPs. In 2013-14, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan offered Rs 150 to wheat farmers on top of the MSP of Rs 1,400 per quintal. Similarly, for paddy, Chhattisgarh and Kerala gave bonuses of Rs 300 and 490 respectively in addition to the MSP of Rs 1,310 per quintal.
But in June, the Union food ministry issued a communication that in the event of states paying bonuses to farmers, procurement for the Central pool would be limited only to the extent of the concerned state’s grain requirement for its public distribution system and other welfare schemes.
Any surplus grain that was procured would have to be disposed of by the state government, which would also be required to “bear the financial burden in that regard”.
The directive has resulted in Chhattisgarh — where procurement has jumped six-fold since 2000-01 — capping official paddy purchases in the new 2014-15 marketing season at 10 quintals per acre, as against the earlier average of 15-20 quintals.
The second big reform step has been to limit the levy on rice mills to a maximum of 25 per cent of production. Till last year, states like Andhra Pradesh were fixing this mandatory quota — which mills have to deliver to the Food Corporation of India or state agencies — at as high as 75 per cent. “The three moves — lower MSP increases, restraints on state-level bonuses and limits on levy — will help us reduce procurement and stockholding beyond the required minimum buffer-cum-strategic reserve requirements,” said a food ministry official. As on October 1, total grain stocks in the Central pool were over 49 million tonnes against the necessary 21.2 MT for that date.
While the official refused to quantify, Tejinder Narang, a New Delhi-based independent grains analyst, estimated rice procurement for the Central pool in the current season to be at least 7-8 MT below the 32 MT of 2013-14.
“It appears that this government’s policy on food security is different continued…

Modi pushes for pact on mutual recognition ofqualificationsPrint
Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:34 am
Two months after it signed a landmark free trade agreement (FTA) in services and investments with the ASEAN, India strongly prodded the 10-nation bloc to wrap up an accompanying pact on the mutual recognition of educational and professional qualifications — an essential prerequisite for India to leverage its competitive advantage in the services sector.
In his address at the 12th India-ASEAN Summit here on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on this issue and said: “I suggest that we conduct a review of our free trade agreement on goods to improve it further and make it beneficial to all. I also urge that the FTA on Services and Investment be brought into force at the earliest … We should move quickly towards mutual Recognition of Degrees”.
The reluctance of ASEAN members to ratify the mutual recognition of degrees pact stems from continuing apprehension on the impact that this could have on their own services sectors.
The Philippines, which is yet to ratify the overarching services agreement, had earlier raised concerns that opening up of the region’s services sector may have an “adverse impact” on its own services industry, given India’s strength in the sector.
India had signed the FTA in services and investments with the ASEAN on September 9, 2014, two years after the discussions on the pact concluded.
The benefits for India from the agreement — which was expected to pave the way for India to leverage its competitive offerings in finance, education, health, IT, telecommunications, transport, movement of professionals and enabling Indian service providers to offer services to ASEAN customers with greater ease than what is possible currently — is unlikely to fructify in the absence of the mutual recognition agreements that essentially honours the educational and professional qualifications across India and the ASEAN.
This is a problem that India already faces in case of similar FTAs in services that it has in place with Japan and South Korea.
The services pact — unarguably India’s strong point — with ASEAN was the first that India had signed with another trading country/bloc after the NDA government assumed office in May.
The delay in signing mutual recognition agreements stems from the opposition by some ASEAN countries to free movement of professionals, given rising unemployment in their countries.
As a result, some of these countries are insisting that Indian professionals should obtain local qualifications; for instance, a doctor wanting to practice in Thailand must obtain a licence from Medical Council of Thailand.
Except for the Philippines, every other ASEAN member — Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia — has ratified the service deal.
India had implemented the FTA in goods with ASEAN members in 2010, while it had concluded the negotiations for FTA in services and investments in 2012.
With the signing of the pact in services and investments, the FTA is stated to become a comprehensive economic partnership between the two sides, but for the hassle of the mutual recognition agreements.
The UPA-II government had come under criticism for signing free trade agreements “in haste” and losing out on continued…

After the longest Teachers’ Day , a longer Children’s Day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to put his stamp on Jawaharlal Nehru’s 125th birthday celebrations. States have been asked to celebrate the day as the launch of a weeklong ‘Bal Swachhta Mission’. Modi is in Australia on Friday, but no one expects him not to be present in spirit. Least of all the Congress, which had hoped to hold a show befitting the 125th birthday — and perhaps escape being eclipsed by Modi, but there is little chance of that. Watch this space — and Twitter, Facebook, and now Instagram.
THE CENTRE
On October 18, the Ministry of Women and Child Development wrote to all states and UTs asking that November 14-19 be focused on the Bal Swachhta Mission theme, and seeking daily updates on activities along with pictures and videos. “Children at anganwadi centres would be sensitised and involved in different aspects of hygiene and safe sanitation,” the letter said. The six main themes: clean anganwadis, clean surroundings (such as playgrounds), clean self (personal hygiene/child health), clean food, clean drinking water and clean toilets.
CONG: Sonia and Rahul Gandhi began the celebrations a day earlier, with a pledge to party men and women, in Delhi on Thursday. November 14 will see a prayer meeting at Shanti Van; and a two-day international conference will be held next week. Many world leaders and former heads of state have been invited, but not Modi.
DELHI
The government will involve children in the six-day Bal Swachhta Mission from Nehru’s birthday to Indira’s (on November 19). Municipalities have been asked to involve staff, and sanitation supervisers directed to felicitate children.
CONG: Campaign started with the Sonia-Rahul function. Manmohan Singh and Sheila Dikshit were present.
PUNJAB
Schools, anganwadis, and the Health and Social Security Departments have been told to administer a “pledge of cleanliness” to children on November 14. District authorities have been instructed to help involve the children.
CONG: Workers will take an oath to fight “divisive forces”. The party will launch a ‘Save Punjab’ campaign in five districts to tackle the problem of drugs.
HARYANA
Activities like Bal Mela, Weight and Measurement of Child, Healthy Baby Competition, Village Health Nutrition Day, Nutrition and Health Education, and competitions like painting and clay modelling will be held at anganwadi centres.
CONG: Functions at all district headquarters, especially Chandigarh, “the city commissioned by PM Nehru to reflect the new nation’s modern, progressive outlook”.
MADHYA PRADESH
Detailed week-long schedule that includes Bal Cabinet discussions on cleanliness, elocution competitions, and a rally and Swachhta pledge (Nov 14); q&a sessions on cleanliness in schools and a handwashing drive before mid-day meals (Nov 15); teachers’ address to students continued…

Addressing the East Asia Summit, the Prime Minister called for rejecting any linkages between religion and terrorism
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday called for rejecting any linkages between religion and terrorism and said that comprehensive response against terrorism requires a genuinely international partnership “against all terrorism”.
Addressing the East Asia Summit here, Mr. Modi said that India supports the EAS declaration on the Islamic State terrorist group, according to tweets posted by External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin.
The rise of jihadist group Islamic State, which indulges in brutal killings and has declared a caliphate in areas overrun by it in Syria and Iraq, is a major cause of concern in the world.
Mr. Modi said that the challenges of terrorism and extremism have increased and nations “have to ensure that cyber and space remain a source of connectivity and prosperity, not new theatres for conflict”.
In reference to the territorial conflicts in the South China Sea, he said that “following international law and norms is important for peace and stability in South China Sea as well”.
“In a world of inter-dependence and globalization, there is no option but to follow international laws and norms,” he stressed.
Referring to the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, he said it has highlighted the importance of international cooperation in combating pandemics.
Mr. Modi informed the gathering that India has contributed $12 million in the efforts against Ebola.
On India’s outreach to Southeast Asian countries, Mr. Modi said his government has moved with “a great sense of priority and speed” to turn the ‘Look East Policy’ into ‘Act East Policy’’.
“No other forum is so critical for peace, stability and prosperity in Asia-Pacific and the world,” he said, referring to the East Asia Summit.
India & ASEAN can be strong partners, whose cooperation can further peace, stability & development in the region. http://t.co/x0tcq50S0S
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 12, 2014
He suggested that countries could “start major initiatives on energy partnership, for example, in the area of solar energy”.
Mr. Modi said the success of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is an “inspiration for broader integration in the Asia-Pacific region”.
He said a “balanced Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement which gives equal emphasis to goods and services, could be a springboard for regional integration and prosperity”.
The RCEP trade agreement is being negotiated by the EAS countries.
Mr. Modi also said that 251 Indian police personnel, including 104 women, remain on duty in Liberia as part of the UN Mission in Liberia, according to tweets posted by @MEAIndia.

Reliance Infrastructure cancels Rs 12 000 cr Mumbai Metro Line 2 projectInfosys founders seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
Reliance Infrastructure today announced the cancellation of Rs 12,000 crore Mumbai’s Metro Line 2 project citing non-fulfilment of certain obligations by Maharashtra government.
“Mumbai Metro Transport Pvt Ltd (MMTPL) wherein Reliance Infrastructure holds 48 per cent of the equity and government of Maharashtra have executed a termination agreement to terminate the concession agreement for the Mumbai Metro Line 2 Project (Charkop -Bandra-Mankhurd corridor),” the company said in statement.
The project was awarded by Maharashtra government to Reliance Infrastructure-led consortium in August 2009 through an international competitive bidding.
The estimated cost of the project was about Rs 12,000 crore.
“Due to non-fulfilment of various critical obligations, by GOM/ Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the project could not take off. Even after four years, despite of the best efforts by Maharashtra government, various project impediments could not be resolved,” Reliance Infrastructure said.
Both parties agreed to terminate the concession agreement at no cost or claim to either party, with government of Maharashtra to return the bank guarantee (of Rs 160 crore) to Mumbai Metro Transport Pvt Ltd.
With the termination of the agreement, all commitments or liabilities of Reliance Infrastructure towards the project including the commitments towards funding the project have been annulled with immediate effect.

New Navy SEAL documentary premieres as debate about publicity continuesBy Dan Lamothe November 13 Follow @danlamothe
A new PBS documentary featuring interviews with numerous Navy SEALs has again raised the question how quiet current and former members of the force should remain about their work.  (Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Kim McLendon/ U.S. Navy)
Navy SEAL leaders warned last week that current and former members of Naval Special Warfare Command should remember that a critical part of the SEAL ethos is, “I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.” The warning came as the U.S. military grappled with how to deal with the disclosure of secrets about the May 2, 2011, raid in Pakistan that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
Nevertheless, a new PBS documentary about the SEALs premiered on Veterans Day outlining Navy SEAL history. Narrated by actor and veterans advocate Gary Sinise, it traces Navy SEAL history over several decades, and includes interviews with such prominent SEALs as Vice Adm. Joseph Maguire, who served as a commander at Naval Special Warfare Command and as a deputy director at the National Counterterrorism Center before retiring in 2010.
The documentary is called “Navy SEALs: Their Untold Story,” and can be seen on the PBS Web site here . Here are a few clips of it:
The video was posted on the Facebook page for U.S. Special Operations Command on Wednesday, and immediately generated criticism, even though no secrets appear to be disclosed.
“Wait a tic … there are actual stories out there that the SEALs have not told?!?” one commenter said.
“Silent Professionals…” another responded, a reference to the SEAL ethos.
//
Post by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) .
Navy Cmdr. Jason Salata, a spokesman for the SEALs, said the documentary had been in the works since 2012, and was vetted by the Defense Department before publication. It did not include active-duty participation, however, he added. Unlike books about the bin Laden raid, it also does not include a laser focus on one mission.
One of the shooters in that mission, Matt Bissonnette, published a best-selling book in 2012, “No Easy Day,” and remains under investigation by the Pentagon for allegedly disclosing classified information.
Another member of that SEAL team, Rob O’Neill, revealed himself recently  to The Washington Post as the man who killed bin Laden. He did so in an effort to maintain control of the story, he said, adding that several members of Congress already knew. His identity had been disclosed by SOFREP.com , written by current and former Special Operations troops, after Fox News publicized that it would reveal the shooter’s identity in an interview that aired on Veterans Day .

Excise on petrol  diesel hiked; no increase in retail ratesFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The government has increased excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 a litre but retail prices will not go up as oil companies offset the hike against an expected reduction on account of falling global oil rates.
The duty hike, which was notified late last evening, will boost government revenue by about Rs 13,000 crore on an annual basis and help contain budget deficit.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the nation’s largest fuel retailer, said the excise duty hike will not be passed on to consumers and will be adjusted against reduction in rates that was likely by this weekend.
The fall in international oil prices had resulted in six consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and two in diesel in the last one month. There was a possibility of another round of cut this weekend.
Excise duty on normal or unbranded petrol was hiked from Rs 1.20 per litre to Rs 2.70 per litre and unbranded diesel from Rs 1.46 a litre to Rs 2.96, a government notification said.
The same on branded petrol was raised from Rs 2.35 a litre to Rs 3.85 and on branded diesel from Rs 3.75 to Rs 5.25 per litre.
“For the moment, we are not passing on the increase in excise duty. It is being absorbed by companies and will be adjusted against review in rates which was due on Saturday,” IOC Chairman B Ashok said.
Revision in rates will be considered at the next fortnight (end of November), he said. “As and when we look at price revision, whenever it is due, we will look at the situation and decide on revising rates then.”
Before the duty hike, petrol cost Rs 64.25 a litre in Delhi and diesel Rs 53.35 a litre. They will continue to be priced at the same rate.
“There is no increase in retail prices,” he said.
While the fall in global rates and the resultant cuts in retail prices have led to loss of revenue to the exchequer, particularly of state governments, there wasn’t any loss to the central government on account of reduction in petrol and diesel prices as excise duty on the two fuel is fixed and not ad valorem.
Unbranded petrol at present attracts a basic excise duty of Rs 1.20 per litre, a special additional excise duty of Rs 6 a litre and a road cess of Rs 2 per litre.
Unbranded diesel attracts a basis excise duty of Rs 1.46 a litre and road cess of Rs 2 per litre.
The total excise duty on unbranded petrol will rise from Rs 9.20 to Rs 10.70 per litre and that on unbranded diesel from Rs 3.46 to Rs 4.96 per litre.
Branded petrol attracts an excise duty of Rs 10.35 per litre which would go up to Rs 11.85 per litre and excise duty on branded diesel will go up from Rs 5.75 to Rs 7.25 a litre.
State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL), following the fortnightly review practice, were due to revise retail rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday.
Going by the trend in international market, retail rates should come down.
Petrol price was last cut by Rs 2.41 a litre on November 1. On the same day, diesel rates were reduced by Rs 2.25 per litre.
Petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs 9.36 per litre since August.
Diesel price was cut for the first time in more than five years on October 19 by Rs 3.37 a litre when the government decided to deregulate the fuel. This was followed by another reduction on November 1.
Sources said oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee-US dollar exchange rate.
Brent crude fell to a four-year low of USD 79.86 per barrel amid signs that OPEC remains unwilling to reduce output to ease concern of a global supply glut.
Brent has lost almost 30 per cent since its June peak amid speculation that global supply is outpacing demand.

Shot through the heart: what Machil fake encounter did to KashmirThe news of the army convicting five of its men, including two officers, for the fake encounter at Machil in north Kashmir took me back in time to 2010.
Army personnel take positions during an encounter with militants in Kashmir. (PTI Photo)
The Valley had erupted in collective anger after news broke that the army had picked up three young men on the promise of finding them jobs had actually killed them and passed them off as militants trying to infiltrate into India from Pakistan.
The anger was intense and the crowds that took to the streets only grew in numbers. The protests were not limited to areas around Nadihal village from where the three men had been taken.
Over the years, reporters covering Kashmir have come to realise and understand that protestors persist on the streets when their anger is genuine; when they know that the 'encounters' are not just fake but are in fact cold blooded murders. The same was visible in 2000 when the army passed off five Kashmiris as foreign mercenaries in what is now infamously known as the Pathribal encounter. The bodies of the five had even been burnt so they could not be identified.
The sheer fury of the protestors had forced then chief minister Farooq Abdullah to exhume the bodies. DNA tests had established that the five were neither infiltrators nor mercenaries but innocent Kashmiris.
Unlike Farooq, his son Omar Abdullah was not able to deal with the angry protestors in 2010. Quite unlike Farooq, who stood by the graves of the Pathribal boys as their bodies were being exhumed, Omar crawled into a shell and locked himself in as his state went on to witness one of the worst phases of violence.
Slogan-shouting, stone pelting boys and girls took over the streets of the Valley and chief minister Omar Abdullah was nowhere to be seen. Edgy personnel belonging to the CRPF (Cent Reserve Police Force) and the local police responded to stones with bullets and the death count only kept mounting as civilian after civilian, innocent after innocent kept getting shot.
 
I went to Srinagar in the summer of 2010. 'Don't you have blood on your hands?' is the question I wanted to ask the chief minister but Omar, while agreeing to meet me in his office, refused to be drawn into an interview.
He sat by the window of his office in Srinagar's secretariat, looking grim and helpless. Normally an easy man to converse with, Omar was in no mood to talk but finally did ask a question: What do you think I should do?
The answer was simple and obvious: you have to step out and assuage your people. 'You have to visit the injured and go to homes that have lost young ones.'
The same evening, news came in of Omar having gone to Srinagar's hospital to meet with the injured but he had made a fatal mistake. He took a helicopter instead of driving, even walking the streets lined with stones.
He will probably not mind me revealing our conversation, for in a tweet in December 2012 - two-and-a-half years later - he wrote, "I made the mistake of not being seen or heard in 2010 summer".
Today, as news came in of the army holding its own guilty (and this itself is rare and a first), he tweeted again, saying, "This is a watershed moment. No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases".
It is a watershed moment indeed. No Kashmiri ever thought they would see the army take action against its own for 'kills' that have oft been used as strategy to bolster records. For too long - and they will never admit to the unwritten rule - army units have been judged by 'kills' and weapons recovered.
Questions are being raised about the timing - about the army's announcement coming two weeks ahead of the first phase of the election. My take on this is simple: the politicians, Omar and his National Conference will be the most worried about the timing because the arrest of five army men has only served as a reminder of the sheer incompetence of his government to deal with the fall-out of Machil.
As for the Kashmiris - it is a long-awaited balm.

DDA draw further delayed due to technical glitchesDDA housing scheme draw further delayed due to technical glitches
Sidhartha Roy , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014
First Published: 20:28 IST(13/11/2014) | Last Updated: 10:53 IST(14/11/2014)
For the applicants of Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing scheme 2014, the wait for the lucky draw is turning out to be an endless one.
 
DDA is not going to meet the latest deadline it had set itself for holding the draw – November 14. DDA is carrying out trial runs of the draw since Monday and is facing technical glitches, which is resulting in the delay.
 
The trial runs, or ‘mock draw’ are being jointly carried out by the Systems department of DDA and a team from C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) at the DDA headquarter Vikas Sadan, where the draw is going to be held.
 
“The C-DAC team has brought all the required hardware to DDA headquarter and along with our Systems officials are working almost 24X7 to ensure a smooth draw of lots,” said a senior DDA official. “The problem is the huge number of applications and the large number of errors that crept into the forms that were submitted by applicants with designated banks,” he said.
 
DDA has received total 10,08,700 applications for the 25,034 flats on offer, most of which are one bedroom flats.
 
“The trial runs are going on and is taking a lot of time because there is a lot of data to be processed. We have been facing some technical glitches too,” said DDA Vice Chairman Balvinder Kumar. “The mock draws are taking six to seven hours to complete because there are so many forms and so many categories, while we want to wrap up the draw between one to two hours,” he said.
 
“The software we are using is a bit old but the Systems department feels it is safe and time tested and don’t want to change it,” said Kumar.

Trolling the trolls trolling the trollsBy Caitlin Dewey November 13 Follow @caitlindewey

Yesterday, in what can only be termed a truly brilliant bit of unabashed media trolling, Time magazine published a poll that asked users to vote on the single worst word of the previous year. Besides “bae,” “basic,” “yaaasssss” and other fairly “obvi” neologisms straight from Chik-fil-a’s list of banned Internet words , Time suggested … feminist. As in — to quote Beyonce quoting Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie — a “person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.”
The nominated “worst words of the year.” (Time)
… In short, Time: “I can’t even.”
And much of the Internet couldn’t either. Within a span of hours, feminists had predictably rallied on Twitter to condemn the magazine and hurl insults at Katy Steinmetz, the author of the poll. (Steinmetz, for her part, explained the word’s inclusion as media commentary. More on that later.)
On 4chan, meanwhile, the gleeful hordes gathered round to game the vote in feminists’ favor. Throughout the late afternoon and evening  Wednesday, users of the forum’s notorious /b/ board stubbornly plugged the vote in successive threads and pasted reactions from peeved feminists on Twitter. As of 9:30 a.m. Thursday, feminist was indeed beating out all other competitors by a double-digit margin … if being ruled the worst word of 2014 could truly be termed a victory.
“Hell yes,” one 4chan denizen rejoiced. “The best part is that this really doesn’t even count as a rigged vote. They included that option as a serious one.”
But let’s not pretend, even for a moment, that America’s favorite weekly magazine did not know exactly what it was getting itself into. This is the magazine that previously saw 4chan hijack its “Person of the Year” poll not once, not twice, but three times: first in 2009, when they rigged the vote to push 4chan’s founder, Christopher Poole, to the top spot; then again in 2012, when North Korea’s Kim Jong Un “won”; and for a third time last year, when hackers, aided by and sometimes organized on 4chan, made sure Miley Cyrus rivaled Pope Francis.
In the wake of those rigged votes, and the Fappening , and a million assorted other 4chan pranks , many of which Time has covered — you cannot possibly put a vote about feminism on the Internet and not expect 4chan to troll you. Au contraire, putting a vote about feminism on the Internet is a savvy, calculated act of provocation. It is, in itself, trolling.
(4chan)
Maybe Time should be congratulated for this savvy strike against the Internet’s anonymous masses; maybe we should cheer them, really, for boldly trolling the trolls, and doing so successfully. Time wins, after all, no matter who loses its poll: outrage = clicks = $$.
But whatever Internet savvy may be contained therein, it’s hard to come away from this spectacle feeling anything other than a sense of resigned smh.

India  US reach agreement on food subsidiesIndia, US settle row over food security
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014
First Published: 11:24 IST(13/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:26 IST(14/11/2014)

India and the United States scripted a compromise formula on food subsidies on Thursday, paving the way to remove a major irritant in the stalled World Trade Organization (WTO) deal on easing of customs rules.
As part of a revised proposal, India and the US have agreed for an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found, marking a major success for the Narendra Modi government in global trade talks withstanding mounting diplomatic pressure from developed countries.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
HT first reported on September 22 the possibility the of breakthrough during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US when he discussed the issue with President Barack Obama.
Developed nations have shown support for a “peace clause” that would agree to developing countries’ demands on food security for a period of four years.
India, however, was pressing for a guarantee for further exemption until a permanent solution is negotiated and to find a way to allow countries the right to provide higher levels of subsidies for their poor beyond these four years.

The latest move will likely help WTO members ratify the so-called trade facilitation agreement (TFA) to make trade easier, faster and cheaper by making systems transparent and reducing red tape.
In July, India had withstood mounting pressure from the developed countries including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s hard bargain strategy for the eventual collapse of the talks putting the WTO’s future in “uncertain ground.”
India had made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even as it took the blame for blocking the TFA in July, as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
"The United States and India reached agreement today (Thursday) on a set of measures intended to break the impasse in the work of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to implement the agreements reached last December," said a US government statement.
The two countries agreed that India's food security programmes would not be challenged under WTO rules "until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted," it said.
India's commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted that India and the US had "successfully resolved their impasse over food security issues in #WTO".
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," she said.
Even after Modi's talks with Obama in September, India, however, held the view that without a permanent solution on food subsidies, public stockholding programmes such as buffer stock of food-grains will be hampered.
Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But, the way the support is calculated at prices of more nearly three decades earlier means many countries would find it difficult to stay within the limit potentially attracting strong penalties from the trade body.
This will affect India’s food security programme and food grain procurement through the minimum support prices (MSP).
Bali package
New Delhi's decision in July to hold up the TFA to reduce trade barriers came after the WTO's members agreed at a December, 2013, meeting in the Indonesian island of Bali to implement the pact.
At the time of the Bali accord, WTO members agreed on a four-year "peace clause" to protect India from being punished over subsidies and stockpiles until a "permanent" solution" was reached. The agreement was due to take effect in mid-2015.
But after the Bali pact, Indian officials complained there were nearly two dozen meetings on the trade facilitation pact and just a handful on subsidies.
Bali was the first multilateral agreement concluded by the WTO since its inception in 1995.
It also signalled the first concrete progress on the Doha Round of trade liberalisation talks, launched in 2001 and aimed at underpinning development in poorer nations.
It took nearly a decade to conclude the trade facilitation part of the talks, which began in 2004.
"The agreement announced today (Thursday) between the US and India paves the way for full implementation of the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)...The agreement also reflects shared understandings regarding the WTO's work on food security," US Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement.
   
"We now look forward to working with all WTO members and with Director-General Roberto Azevedo to reach a consensus that enables full implementation of all elements of the landmark Bali Package, including the TFA," he added.

President Pranab Mukherjee says Nehru respected OppositionPresident says Nehru respected Opposition
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014

Describing Jawaharlal Nehru as the jewel of India, President Pranab Mukherjee attributed modern India as Nehru's creation.
Jawaharlal Nehru
"India is what it is today because of Nehru. Let us celebrate his legacy and draw inspiration from his life," President said, delivering the 46th Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Lecture in the 125th birth anniversary of the country's first Prime Minister.
President's remarks come even as the bitter tussle continued in the political circle over the Nehru's 125th birth anniversary celebrations.
Mukherjee, in fact, cited both Indo-US Nuclear deal and the 2014 general election as key moments of India's recent history and said that these milestones reflect "how Nehru's legacy is not just intact, but continues to lead modern day India."
Interestingly, the President underlined how Nehru carried the Opposition along with him in parliament even in the absence of an established Opposition leader - a situation that prevails in the current parliament. "Nehru was aware that the lack of an established Opposition meant significant weakness in the system," said the President.
"Nehru frequently met Opposition leaders to exchange ideas on crucial issues and asked his Ministers to welcome probing questions and debates. Even though, there was no formal opposition party, Nehru gave highest respect to Opposition leaders," Mukherjee added.
Earlier, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and vice president Rahul Gandhi participated in a party's function to commemorate the 125th anniversary of Nehru.
Home minister Rajnath Singh will kick start the government's celebrations of the milestone event on Thursday. The government is set to launch a portal on Nehru, release commemorative coins and organize a series of lectures.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already asked his machinery to start "Swachh Bal Abhiyan" on the occasion to promote sanitation and cleanliness.

Last week, the orphaned otter dubbed Pup 681 stole our hearts . On Nov. 18, we can chill with her poolside.
Via Google Hangout, that is.
Right now, the only update we have on Pup 681 is that she's doing great -- and learning to swim, as you can see in the above video. You can also observe that she's still as squeaky and adorable as ever, thank goodness.
But Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, which became Pup 681's new home after the orphaned otter was rescued from a beach in California, is going to give the Internet full access next week. A special Google+ Hangout stream will introduce viewers to the pup and her trainers, showing how the otter goes about her days.
In the meantime, you can get your otter fix by learning about the aquarium's other cuties -- Pup 681 might be their biggest star, but she isn't their only otter!

PM: India  ASEAN must collaborate to tackle terrorism | World looking at IndiaASEAN
(Modi specifically mentioned…)
NAY PYI TAW: India and ASEAN must collaborate to tackle terrorism, drug-trafficking and gun-running, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said, citing the successful intelligence sharing between India and Malaysia.
Modi specifically mentioned the example of security intelligence sharing between India and Malaysia when he met his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak yesterday.
He said the Indo-Malaysian model could be followed with other ASEAN member countries as well.
"There is a need for India and ASEAN to collaboratively tackle terrorism, drug-trafficking and gun-running," Modi said.
Malaysia last week deported a suspected Sikh militant wanted for the 2009 killing of Rulda Singh, president of the Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, a RSS-affiliated Sikh cultural outfit.
During his stay in the Myanmar capital, Modi also met Russia Premier Dmitry Medvedev , The Philippines President Benigno Aquino , Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Indonesian President Joko Widodo .
Modi, who is on a 10-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji, met the leaders on the sidelines of the two back-to-back India-ASEAN and East Asia summits here.
FEATURED ARTICLES

With new team in place  PM Narendra Modi tightens grip on power in IndiaAnil Swarup is just the kind of man Prime Minister Narendra Modi is relying on to fix India – a high-flying civil servant with a taste for complex policy and swift decisions.
Highlights
* Trusted bureaucrats promoted, some ministers sidelined
* Changes designed to streamline government
* Critics flag danger of too much power in too few hands
Narendra Modi has drawn trusted bureaucrats into a tight embrace. Interviews with two dozen sources, including close aides, reveal that key decisions are now thrashed out between his office and civil servants, often at the expense of ministerial authority.
Swarup sees a golden era for those willing to rise to the challenge. In his case that means ending coal shortages that keep much of India in the dark, a top priority for Narendra Modi.
In a series of meetings with civil servants, often without the ministers they nominally report to, Modi has urged bold decisions and promised all the help they need.
“He has given a virtual carte blanche. Go and do it,” Swarup said. However, he did not say the responsibility handed to him had come at the expense of ministers.
Such moves, along with disciplinary innovations such as finger scanners to track attendance, have helped break a logjam in decision-making that undermined the last government, spawned corruption scandals and soured the investment climate.
Narendra Modi’s style also lessens dissent from potential rivals, helping him capture power to a degree not seen since Indira Gandhi ruled India with an iron fist 30 years ago.
Critics call it authoritarian and say he is weakening India’s collegiate cabinet system. Some in government caution that in a country as complex as India, over-centralization can lead to new bottlenecks.
The government denies there is interference in the ministries, saying Narendra Modi’s role is to facilitate policy.
“There is one misconception – the PMO (Prime Minister’s Office) does not issue direction to the ministries,” Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said.
“MIDNIGHT MASSACRES”
The shakeup started as soon as Narendra Modi took office six months ago, when he declared “all important policy issues” part of his portfolio. He quickly took control of bureaucratic appointments, cutting ministers out of the loop.
Since September, there have been three major reshuffles in the civil service, all closely overseen by Narendra Modi and his core team. Top officials have woken to find themselves thrust into the limelight, or shunted into administrative backwaters.
A cabinet expansion on Sunday and a new finance ministry team advised by leading economist Arvind Subramanian should boost the capacity and intellectual heft of the government.
Yet not everyone is happy with the new order.
Those on the wrong side of reshuffles dub them “midnight massacres” that have slowed policies. Survivors murmur they are scared to take decisions that might anger Narendra Modi.
A programme to sell stakes in state-owned companies worth $9.5 billion has barely started, in part because Modi purged the top team of bureaucrats at the finance ministry before bringing in Subramanian.
Tales of cabinet members’ clipped wings abound.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh has been weakened, ministry officials say, since rumours swirled that his son was influence peddling. Narendra Modi publicly denied those rumours and backed Singh, but has kept him on the back foot since.
When heavy shelling broke out between home ministry border troops and Pakistani Rangers in October, Singh was hardly consulted.
“The PMO is directly communicating with officers. Rajnath is a mere decorative figure in the ministry,” said one senior home ministry official. Singh ranks second in the government, but has been silent at cabinet meetings, another official said.
GUJARAT MODEL
Narendra Modi’s preference to work with the bureaucracy and junior ministers was honed during 12 years as chief minister of Gujarat. Now he wants to replicate that model, sources said.
“He is aware that it cannot be done immediately but you have to drive the policy,” said Saurabh Patel, Gujarat’s oil minister who worked closely with Modi.
As in Gujarat, Modi controls communication, limits media access and brands major policies as his own. His control of the Bharatiya Janata Party is also extensive, with the old guard sidelined and his closest aide installed as party president.
Many Indians voted for firm leadership, after the scandal-tainted administration of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.
“He feels that we have been so weakened that he has to be in control,” said Manjeet Kripalani, founder of the Gateway House think-tank.
But concerns remain that centralization and pressure to move quickly have led to ill-advised decisions, including one likely to cross Swarup’s desk.
Under pressure to reduce India’s reliance on imports, coal minister Piyush Goyal ordered the opening of the Amrapali mine in the eastern state of Jharkhand – the first major pit to open in five years.
There was only one problem: the mine is 85 km (53 miles) from the nearest railway, at the end of a rutted track, making it expensive to transport the coal. As a result, there are few customers, officials said.
“The pressure is to just produce without having facilities to evacuate coal,” said an official at Coal India, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

(The Chanda Kochhar-led…)
MUMBAI: Private sector lender ICICI Bank today raised 600 million yuans from the Chinese debt market (Dim Sum bonds) or a little over $ 95 million, at a coupon of 4 per cent, merchant banking sources said here this evening.
This is the fourth time that the city-based lender has tapped the Dim sum bond market and has so far raised 2,050 million yuans.
According to merchant bankers, the three-year money has been raised by ICICI's Bahrain branch and will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange . The issue is part of the bank's $ 7.5 billion medium term note programme.
Dim sum bonds are denominated in the Chinese currency and are issued in the Hong Kong market, and therefore resident Chinese investors cannot subscribe to these instruments.
When contacted an ICICI bank spokesman refused to comment.
It can be noted that the Chanda Kochhar-led bank first tapped the Chinese debt market in 2012 and raised 1,000 million yuans in two tranches. The bank again went to this market last year last year and raised 650 million yuans.
The current issuance was arranged by StanChart and Mitsubishi UFG.
Meanwhile, the international rating agency Moody's in a note from Singapore, said it has assigned Baa2 to these senior unsecured notes.
Assigning the Baa2 rating Moody's said the rating is anchored on the bank's Baa3 baseline credit assessment and the high likelihood of systemic support in the event of a crisis.
It further said the Baa2 rating is at the same level as the foreign currency debt ceiling for India. The bank's foreign currency deposit ratings of Baa3/P-3 are constrained by the sovereign ceiling.

BlackBerry signs up Samsung, others, in new mobile services push
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 11.16PM IST
(BlackBerry said it would…)
SAN FRANCISCO: BlackBerry Ltd struck partnerships with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other high-profile players to enhance the capabilities of the new mobile-device management and security platform it unveiled on Thursday, and its shares jumped 8 per cent.
BlackBerry and Samsung, the world's largest mobile phone maker, will offer a "highly secure mobility solution" for Samsung's Android phones starting in early 2015. The system couples BlackBerry's enterprise platform capability with the South Korean company's own security software for its Galaxy devices.
"The partnership with Samsung is a very big deal," said John Jackson, a technology analyst at IDC. "It's hard to imagine a partnership with more significant practical impact potential."
BlackBerry said the Samsung tie-up is a long-term commitment.
"To make this Samsung partnership happen, we went to the highest levels of both companies, so this is a very serious relationship," said John Sims, BlackBerry's head of global enterprise services, calling the deal "the tip of the iceberg".
BlackBerry also touted a string of improvements to its existing products, including mobile video-conferencing via its messaging app and the ability to divide usage costs between employer and employee.
BlackBerry's Nasdaq-listed shares were up 8.7 per cent at $12.25, their highest since August 2013.
CONNECTING MACHINES
The new platform, the BlackBerry Enterprise Service, or BES12, will allow corporations and government agencies to manage and make secure not only BlackBerry's mobile devices, but also those running on operating systems such as Google Inc's
Android, Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows platform.
  For the first time, the platform will also be able to manage the use of medical diagnostic equipment, industrial machinery and motor vehicles.
BlackBerry also announced a BES12 deal with Brightstar, the world's largest wireless distribution company, and a tie-up with business software company Salesforce.com Inc that will let clients in healthcare and other regulated industries use Salesforce software to securely access data via the BlackBerry platform.
"It looks as though BES12 ticks all the boxes," IDC's Jackson said. "The challenges are it is just a phenomenally competitive environment full of very capable, very well-capitalized big guys like IBM and SAP."
The new products and services are the backbone of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen's plan to turn around the smartphone pioneer, whose devices have lost ground to Apple's iPhone, Samsung's Galaxy devices and a slew of other gadgets powered by Google's Android operating system.
While still a player in the smartphone business, BlackBerry is pivoting to focus on services and the demands of a large base of enterprise clients that are increasingly grappling with data security concerns.
The Waterloo, Ontario-based company said its customers have registered for five million BES licenses since it launched a migration push in March, with some 30 per cent of them moving from rival mobile-device management platforms.

Islamic State releases audio of chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after death rumours
AFP Nov 13, 2014, 11.03PM IST
("Its march will not stop…)
BAGHDAD: The Islamic State group Thursday released an audio recording it said was of chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, days after air strikes on jihadist leaders in Iraq sparked rumours he was wounded or killed.
In the 17-minute message, the man purported to be Baghdadi made no direct reference to the strike against IS leadership but mentioned developments that have occurred since.
"Be assured, O Muslims, for your state is good and in the best condition," he said, according to an English transcript of the message released together with the recording.
The audio message was the first of Baghdadi since a video released in July, shortly after IS proclaimed a caliphate over parts of Iraq and Syria, of the jihadist supremo delivering a Friday sermon in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
The voice in Thursday's audio document appeared to match but there was no immediate confirmation of its authenticity from other sources.
The United States said that coalition aircraft launched strikes targeting Islamic State leaders near Mosul on Friday, setting off a flurry of speculation that Baghdadi was wounded.
Some reports pointed to another strike near Iraq's border with Syria, saying Baghdadi was wounded there instead.
In the recording, Baghdadi said that the US-led coalition of dozens of nations contributing to the military effort against IS was failing to defeat his group.
"Its march will not stop and it will continue to expand, by Allah's permission," he said. "The march of the mujahidin (holy warriors) will continue until they reach Rome."
"And soon, the Jews and Crusaders will be forced to come down to the ground and send their ground forces to their deaths and destruction," he said.

UK to recognise CBSE certificate for undergraduate programmeUK to recognise CBSE certificate for undergraduate programme

In a good news for students aspiring to take admission to undergraduate programme in UK, the universities there have agreed to recognise plus-two certificates awarded by India's Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).
HRD Minister Smriti Irani said United Kingdom has also agreed to help the students facing visa related issues. "Till now, CBSE students faced a problem as their
certificate was not being recognised by several institutes.
"We raised this issue with UK earlier also and I am happy to state that they have worked on our concern and all UK universities will recognise the certificates," she said.
The minister was talking to reporters after chairing the 6th UK India Bilateral Education Forum meeting in New Delhi.
Non-recognition of certificates were discouraging many students from taking admission in UK.
Institutes there insisted students clearing the CBSE exam to do an add-on course to be eligible for admission to undergraduate courses, that school education in India was a year less than the British system.
Some of them also demanded IELTS scores, which indicate a student's proficiency in English.
At the meeting, India also sought relaxation in the post-study work visa norms that allow students to work with a minimum salary threshold of 20,000 British Pounds a year.
"We have also decided to set up a working group as to how the  two countries can go ahead together especially in areas of school assessment programme, school and college leadership programme and taking education to every door through ICT," Irani said.
UK's minister of state for universities Greg Clark said the body would also make sure that problems with the visa system can be addressed at the highest level in UK.
Both the countries have also agreed to have exchange of academics, educators and industrial partners visiting each other campuses, he said.
Irani had sought a commitment from the UK side in this regard at the meeting.
Clark, minister said British government had initiated a programme, under which 25,000 young people would be sent to India to study in the next five years.
The first batch of students would reach Indian shores next summer, he said. Britain will institute a Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Lecture and India would partially fund the initiative.

Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of seasonal workers hired by UPS. UPS will hire up to 95,000 temporary workers, 10,000 more than last year.
Growing numbers of  retailers will push holiday delivery deadlines to the last minute possible, even after shipping companies failed last year to keep pace with record demand and left thousands of angry customers without presents under their Christmas trees.
More than a quarter of retailers surveyed by Kurt Salmon, a global management consulting firm, say they will guarantee Christmas delivery for orders placed one to three days before the holiday, up from 17% last year. Half of the retailers say they will take orders up to Dec. 20 for Christmas delivery, up from 37% last year.
Among the retailers offering last-minute delivery are Amazon, with one-day delivery in the continental U.S. on orders placed by Dec. 23, Macy's, with a Dec. 22 cutoff, and Toys 'R' Us, with express shipping guarantees until noon on Dec. 23.
E-commerce has continued to surge and demand for holiday delivery is higher than ever. Forrester Research, which analyzes technology companies, products and services,  predicts e-commerce sales will   increase 13% to $89 billion this year.
Making the most of early holiday shopping
Last-minute delivery poses tough challenges for retailers. They risk customer anger if they fail to deliver and must pay a premium to shippers to get the service, sometimes jeopardizing a profit.
"It might hurt the bottom line, but if they don't offer free and fast shipping the fear is that somebody else will," Steve Osburn, Kurt Salmon's supply chain expert, said.
UPS angered thousands of customers last year when guaranteed-delivery packages arrived days after Christmas. UPS blamed bad winter weather and a greater than expected boom in online shopping.
"Retailers and shippers are going to have to be exponentially better at execution than they were last year," Osburn said.
UPS, FedEx and USPS, the nation's largest shippers, say they are ready to handle the increased demand. After last year's experience, FedEx and UPS say they have made big changes to prepare for the expected surge. The U.S. Postal Service will switch to seven-day package delivery after Thanksgiving, as it did last year, to accommodate the increases.
10 huge Black Friday predictions
UPS began planning for peak holiday season the day after Christmas last year, UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said. The shipping giant worked with major retailers to get a sense a of how many packages to expect and where they will be headed during the holiday peak.
If the retailers exceed UPS' capacity,  Rosenberg said UPS "will give them the true picture" of what it can handle.
"Retailers are encouraging people to buy early, but there always are procrastinators," she said.
UPS expects to deliver more than 585 million packages during the holidays, 11% more than last year, Rosenberg said.
To manage the increase, UPS has expanded some of its existing buildings, added 11 other buildings and has dispatched 15 temporary mobile distribution centers, purchased more trucks and will hire up to 95,000 seasonal workers, 10,000 more than last year, Rosenberg said.
UPS delivered  31 million packages on its peak shipping day last year. This year, UPS expects to exceed that number on six different days during the holiday season. At its peak on Dec. 22, UPS expects to deliver 34 million packages.
Money-saving strategies for holiday shopping
FedEx is adding more than 50,000 seasonal positions including package handlers, helpers and drivers, the company said. USPS has hired about 30,000 temporary holiday employees, USPS spokeswoman Sue Brennan said.
"The Postal Service has planned for this and we're ready," Brennan said. "This really is our season and we take the job of delivering holiday gifts on time very seriously."
Shoppers remain skeptical. Some consumers say last year's debacle will change how they shop.
"You have to be realistic," said Valerie Wire, 24, of New York City, who shops frequently online.  "No matter the promise or guarantee, between delivery problems, mishaps, inclement weather, or literally anything else that could go wrong ... you just never know how long it will take."
Joaille Araujo, 24, of Teaneck, N.J., said there is "absolutely no way" she trusts the delivery promises and will shop in stores instead of online.
"Last year everyone was disappointed," Araujo said. One 5-year-old family member's dream gift, a Dora Explorer dollhouse, didn't make it under the family Christmas tree, she said. Several out-of-town relatives had to fly home before their computers arrived.
"Christmas is one day. It's not the entire month," Araujo said. "You trust the stores to know that."
Michael Perry, 60, of Boulder, Colo., said his gifts for family arrived days after Christmas. Perry says he isn't counting on any promised delivery dates, "not after last year."
"I've still got a grudge," Perry said. "How do I explain to my 92-year-old mother why her sweater is not under the tree? How do you explain that you waited until the last minute because you trusted these stores?"
While some customers say they won't shop online, many others will succumb to the lure of online bargains and convenience, consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow said.
"Shoppers have much shorter memories than retailers do," Yarrow said. "Shoppers will be online more than ever. It will be online, online online for research, planning and purchasing."

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

More Scam Websites to Lure the Poor to For-Profit Collegesreddit
Yesterday I reported on how a Utah-based company, Neutron Interactive, operated a website that promised jobs but was in reality a scam -- it seemed to function mainly to send customer leads to at least one other company's Salt Lake City call center, called EdSoup, whose only purpose, in turn, is to recruit people, mostly low-income people, to high-priced training programs at for-profit colleges. Similar sites promise food stamps, Medicaid, and heating assistance, but all lead to more pitches to sign up for expensive programs at the University of Phoenix, Brown Mackie, Colorado Tech, Kaplan, and other for-profits.  EdSoup employees gave me the scoop on this shameless, deceptive operation, and backed it up with documentation, which I supplemented with my own research.
Within 90 minutes of my posting that story yesterday on Republic Report and The Huffington Post , the site, localemploymentnetwork.org, had been shut down. Perhaps just caution by its operators, or perhaps some concern about suggestions I made that the Neutron and EdSoup operations might be violating federal and state laws.
But with more than $30 billion a year in taxpayer money going to the for-profit college industry, the shady world of generating leads of potential students is a thousand-headed regenerating hydra, and I am only beginning to discover that a lot more information is hiding in plain sight.  
This morning, I got curious and did a quick web search.
At a site called scamadviser.com, I found a page showing that the server that had hosted localemploymentnetwork.com, based at Digital Ocean in New York City, runs four other websites. One is neutronnetwork.com, which advertises Neutron Interactive's services of providing "strictly compliant leads" to for-profit college companies like Corinthian, ITT Tech, and the shuttered-for-fraud ATI , and shows an image of a smiling health care worker that is also found on another shady site, with contact info in the Philippines, that I highlighted yesterday,  medicaidinsurancebenefits.com .
Neutron, by the way, is a proud member of the for-profit college trade association, APSCU , whose shameless leader, former congressman Steve Gunderson (R-WI), keeps decrying the alleged vicitimization of his sector at the hands of government -- even though government provides almost 90 percent of the revenue for many APSCU schools.
The other three sites on the New York-based server are JusticeCareersOnline.com , medicalcareeralliance.org , and toptruckers.com , and all seem to be in the same vein as localemploymentnetwork -- promising jobs up front , but before you can see any jobs, you must enter your contact information and agree  "that the phone number provided (home or cell) may be dialed by automated technology so that I may be contacted by online.justicecareersonline.com and up to 3 partners regarding education or employment details and I am not required to consent to receive services." In other words, more leads for boiler room for-profit colleges sales operations like EdSoup.
No doubt there are many more such scam sites operating on the Internet today, and maybe they won't come down until each one is discovered and called out by me or others -- or shut down by law enforcement.  We'll see.

Congress in attack mode  to meet GovernortodayPrint
Written by Kavitha Iyer | Mumbai | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:35 am
If there were doubts raised on why Congress legislators did not react strongly and speedily during the controversial trust vote for the Devendra Fadnavis government Wednesday, the party has now decided to gloss over those with an all-new aggression against the BJP.
Sniffing an opportunity in the disquiet against the apparent lack of transparency in the voice vote, the party has decided to strategically target BJP for what it calls an unconstitutional move on the floor of the assembly. MPCC chief Manikrao Thakre said the Congress was examining all aspects of the trust vote, adding that the party would soon come out with a specific course of action to “seek justice” and “ensure the upholding of Constitutional provisions”.
With its 121 MLAs and 14-odd MLAs from among the Independents and smaller parties, the BJP would fall short of the 145-mark in the Vidhan Sabha without the support of the NCP. Congress leaders Thursday said the strategy was not really to question the numbers the BJP claimed to have on the floor of the house, but a ploy to put the BJP on the mat for having accepted the active or latent support of the NCP.
Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said the party was extremely unhappy with the lack of transparency in the voice vote procedure. “The hypocrisy of the BJP regarding the NCP is totally exposed. The BJP owes an answer to the people of Maharashtra,” Chavan said. He added that the party’s strategy was now to be an extremely active Opposition party, but not one that was obstructionist. “We will support policies and decisions that are for the welfare of the people,” he said.
At least part of the Congress’s protest is only posturing, leaders accept. “Nobody wants a poll, but let the BJP admit that it doesn’t have the mandate without the support of a party they termed the Naturally Corrupt Party,” said a former minister. With the Shiv Sena’s objective appearing muddy, with the party expecting to join the government till as late as Tuesday night before the trust vote, the Congress finds itself gifted with a windfall opportunity to occupy the space of the most belligerent and coherent Opposition. It also appeared that the highly faction-ridden party somehow got its act together through Wednesday and Thursday. While politicians, media and Vidhan Bhavan staff saw the unlikely sight of senior Congress leaders, including Chavan who seemed distinctly uncomfortable in the role, squatting on the steps of the Vidhan Bhavan and shouting slogans, the party appeared to have put its various internal differences aside for now.
Rajya Sabha MP and former Planning Commission member Dr Bhalchandra Mungekar said the point of contention was that the voice vote procedure itself was not completed correctly.

He is 26  and only India link to historiclandingChaitanya Giri
Written by Anuradha Mascarenhas | Pune | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:12 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 1:18 pm
Barely 26 now, Dr Chaitanya Giri was not even born when the European Space Agency (ESA) conceptualised its Rosetta mission. He is the sole Indian scientist on the crew in charge of the Rosetta mission that achieved the feat on November 12 — landing robotic spacecraft Philae lander on a comet.
After finishing his BSc (Honours) in Chemistry and MSc in Biophysics from Mumbai, where he grew up, Giri did his PhD in chemistry from France and worked at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Göttingen, Germany.
“I am a third generation scientist working on the mission and the most fascinating fact is that Rosetta was conceptualised when I was not even born. The success of the mission is entirely credited to the million man-hours invested by close to a thousand scientists and engineers across three generations. All I can say is I have stood on the shoulders of giants,” Giri said in an email to The Indian Express.
Philae lander is the first ever spacecraft to land safely on a comet.
“Landing on a comet might clear some of the immense ambiguities in our understanding of the existence of life. Also comet material has never been explored at such close distances and the exotic material that it potentially possesses might have tremendous applications in a wide gamut of industry,” he said.
“I have been working towards the hardware optimisation of an instrument called COSAC and analyses of the data that it generates. COSAC was designed and built at the MPS. I have been working with the team led by COSAC’s principal investigator Dr Fred Goesmann since 2011,” Giri said.
Speaking about the Cometary Sampling and Composition Experiment (COSAC), a chemical analytical instrument on the lander, he said it was designed to identify the organic composition of the comet surface, and specifically to identify molecules that believed to be responsible for the origin of life on Earth.
“We are still anxious, resilient and inquisitive. Our central task begins now — crunching the data into meaningful science. The mission design involves numerous experiments that are scheduled to take place in the next few weeks. The environment where the lander is standing is violent and nothing like that experienced by the landers on the Moon and on Mars. There might be comet quakes (like earthquakes) or ultra-cold volcanoes beneath the lander! Our ultimate wish is to see the lander survive and be functional throughout all the scheduled experiments,” said Giri, who spent the entire night celebrating with the crew after some tense moments.
ESA has been a leader of comet exploration for more than 30 years and it had conceptualised the Rosetta mission in the late 1980s. “That was when ESA already had met success with its Giotto mission to Halley’s comet. Giotto was the first ever mission to closely study any comet. By the late 1990s, most of the Rosetta instruments were in the advanced stages of development,” said Giri.

Machil sentencing: Three lives taken for the sake of medals  each bought at Rs50 000Family of Shahzad Ahmad Khan in Nadihal village on Thursday. (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)
Written by Muzamil Jaleel | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:09 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 7:47 pm
Four years ago when the bodies of three young men arrived home in Nadihal, a northern Kashmir village surrounded by apple orchards, willows and poplar trees, it led to the unfolding of a complex narrative of counterinsurgency and greed for medals and petty rewards among a group of Army officers and their local collaborators.
Shahzad Ahmad Khan, 27, Mohd Shafi Lone, 19, and Riyaz Ahmad Lone, 20, had been lured by the Army to Kalaroos in Kupwara on April 29, 2010, according to the findings of the subsequent police probe. They were killed later that night at Sona Pindi on the Machil sector. Army officers then called them foreign militants who were killed in an encounter while trying to infiltrate the Line of Control.
Their bodies were buried in a graveyard near the LoC. To prove that they were foreign militants, a black beard had been painted on the face of Shafi Lone, the youngest, and a picture taken.
A visit to Nadihal that year unravelled a story more complex than most others of staged encounters in Kashmir. Police investigations would later find that one Bashir Ahmad Lone had laid the death trap, literally selling them for Rs 50,000 each to Army men. Bashir was a counter-insurgent while his brother, Qayoom, was a policeman. Villagers burnt his house down after the three bodies were exhumed and brought back to Nadihal.
These three men had no connection with the armed movement and one of them was even close to the Army. How did they end up in an Army camp in far-off Kalaroos?
This was because all of them were living in poverty. When an offer for work at Rs 2,000 a day came, they couldn’t refuse. The day he left, Shahzad’s wife gave him Rs 50 because he had nothing else.
Find and execute
The interrogation of four persons, especially Territorial Army jawan Abbas Hussain Shah and Army source Hameed, found that troops of the 4 Rajputana Rifles were in a hurry to stage an encounter on the Line of Control to secure a unit citation and cash award before they would shift out of the valley. The killings took place on the night of April 29-30, 2010; the unit shifted out within a week.
Abbas Hussain Shah, who has been exonerated, claimed to have been in constant touch with “Major Upendra” ever since he joined 19 Division Headquarters in Baramulla. Shah said his job was to scout around for information. “In April, Major sahib asked to arrange a few young men and told me we have to send them across to Pakistan to bring weapons and track (a group of militants) whom we could trap.
Major sahib promised to pay them and I asked Hameed for help,” he had told The Indian Express in an interview at Sopore police station.
Hameed had earlier introduced Bashir Ahmad Lone, the counter-insurgent from Nadihal, to Abbas. “Bashir’s nephew was in the Army school and he wanted his fee waived and I took him to the officers. He became my friend too,’’ Abbas said.
Hameed asked Bashir to arrange a few men for the army, and, according to police records, he claimed to have told Abbas and Hameed later that he had arranged three men from his village and offered them Rs 2,000 a day for work at the LoC. The trip to Kalaroos was scheduled for April 27. According to Hameed’s version, Bashir arranged a Tata Sumo and along with Hameed and the three travelled to the 4 Rajput camp in Kalaroos.
“The major asked us to go back home and come on April 29, 2010, as the weather was not good. On April 29, Abbas accompanied us,’’ Hameed told police. “They were happy that they would be paid well for the work. They were chatting and joking. Abbas bought some coke and chips. At Kupwara, he took us to a hotel where we all had kanti (fried boneless mutton) with naan. We even smoked charas.”
Hameed told interrogators “Major sahib” was waiting with two Army vehicles at Kalaroos. “He asked the three to get into one truck and asked us to board the other. He asked Bashir to leave in the Sumo,” he said.
The next morning, Abbas and Hameed were reportedly given Rs 1.5 lakh by the major along with two bottles of whisky and two beer bottles as their reward. This was after they had been separated during the night; their statements say the major had taken Abbas along with him.
After the three men were killed, the Army claimed to have recovered five AK rifles, ammunition and Pakistani currency from them. The police say the unit received Rs 6 lakh as cash award for this operation.
Cracking the case
The man who helped take the lid off the fake encounter was Shahzad’s close friend Fayaz Ahmad Wani. The day the three went missing, Shahzad had spoken to Wani on phone and told him he was with Bashir Lone, who had hired him for Rs 2,000 a day to work with the Army and that he was on his way to Kalaroos.
On May 10, the families of the three men in Nadihal registered a missing persons report with Panzla police station in Sopore. Shahzad’s family told police that Wani had informed them about Shahzad’s call. The police analysed call details of the victims and of Bashir and found that they had all gone to Kalaroos. Bashir was picked up on May 21, and subsequently police arrested Hameed too. Abbas was arrested on May 27.
2,943 Number of unidentified bodies listed by International Peoples Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice in a report published in 2009. These had been found in 55 villages in Bandipora, Baramulla, and Kupwara districts of Kashmir, all killed by the armed forces and buried without ever ascertaining their identity, according to the report, Buried Evidence: Unknown, Unmarked, and Mass Graves in Kashmir .

Indian-origin jihadist flees UK forISISPrint
By: Express News Service | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:09 am
An Indian-origin Islamist activist facing trial on terrorism charges skipped bail and fled the country with his family on Wednesday, headed through Paris to the Islamic State, British media have reported. The escape, first revealed by The Daily Mail, came after Abu Rumaysah failed to surrender his passport, a condition of his bail, and has led to opposition charges of police incompetence.
Born Siddhartha Dhar to a family of Bihar-Bengal origin, Abu Rumaysah was arrested in September along with nine others, on charges of inciting terrorism, as part of an ongoing investigation of the London-based pro-jihadist group al-Muhajiroun, Indian diplomatic sources in London told The Indian Express.
The sources said authorities in the UK had not requested any information on Rumaysah’s links, and there did not appear to be any connection between his radicalisation and his country of origin. They added that there was no record of Rumaysah having visited India in the past several years.
Al-Muhajiroun, led by Bangladesh-origin Islamist Anjem Chowdhuri, has been at the forefront of campaigning for the Islamic State in the UK — mainly in public. Rumaysah, who sources said converted to Islam during his teens and had long been estranged from his family, was a key member of the group and its offshoots, organising roadshows that sought to convert troubled youth to the cause.
It was at one of these that he is believed to have met, and possibly mentored, Michael Adebolajo, who beheaded British soldier Lee Rigby on a London street.
Rumaysah had, several times in the past, offered to renounce his citizenship if he was allowed to travel to the territories in Iraq and Syria now held by the Islamic State. In an interview to the UK’s Channel 4 in August, he said he “would love to live under the Islamic State and under the shariah”.
In a lecture delivered in September, laden with communal invective, Rumaysah praised Adolf Hitler for seeking to crush a purported Jewish conspiracy he described as “this evil thing”. He added that Zionists had “no regard for human life”, citing as evidence the prominence of Jews in the medical profession, which he alleged dispensed drugs which have “adverse side-effects”.
In a November interview to the BBC’s popular ‘60 Minutes’ programme, Rumaysah also defended Muslim vigilante groups charged with attacking women and homosexuals. “I want to see every single woman in this country covered from head to toe,” he said “I want to the see the hand of the thief cut. I want to see adulterers stoned to death.”
Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, was among several prominent British figures who said he was shocked at the ease with which Rumaysah was able to evade authorities. “Evidence of Mr Rumaysah’s statements at various times show that he wanted to leave the country,” he told the BBC on Wednesday. “So one would have hoped that the authorities were aware of that.”

Islamic State jihadists to mint own gold  silver and coppercoinsThe Islamic State jihadist group announced today it will start minting its own gold, silver and copper coins.
By: Agence-France Presse | Beirut | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:06 am
The Islamic State jihadist group announced today it will start minting its own gold, silver and copper coins for use in areas under IS control in Syria and Iraq.
“God willing, coins of several types will be minted from gold, silver and copper,” the IS said in a statement distributed on jihadist forums.
The aim was to replace “the tyrannical currency system that was imposed on the Muslims, and which led to their oppression”.
The IS said its circulation of the new coins, to counter the widely-used US dollar, would free Muslims “from profiteering, satanical economic oppression”, and it posted pictures of what the coins would look like.
On one side, the words “Islamic State” and “a caliphate following the model of the Prophet (Mohammed)” are engraved, as well as the weight and value of the coin.
On the other, various symbols are used.
The five-dinar gold coin shows a world map, while the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem is portrayed on the silver 10-dirham coin.
The crescent is embossed on one of the copper coins, while three palm trees are engraved on another.
Unlike the modern form of the dinar used today in some Muslim countries, the ancient dinars were made of pure gold and silver rather than less precious metals.
Experts say the IS is financed mainly through extortion of local populations in areas it controls, crude oil sales and ransoms for kidnappings.
It is unclear how much precious metals the group has amassed.

Old Navy Under Fire Over Plus-Size Women ControversyOld Navy is in hot water over allegations that it charges extra for women's plus-size clothing, but not for men's . Now, the company is explaining what's behind the double standard.
A petition on Change.org that has gathered over 16,000 signatures states that Old Navy charges $12-$15 more for plus-sized women's jeans than for "regular" sizes, but does not do the same for men's plus-sized jeans. The petition was first reported on by BuzzFeed.
It's not uncommon for a company to charge more for plus-size clothes. In the past, companies have justified higher prices for larger clothing items by saying the extra fabric costs manufacturers more. But this wouldn't explain the disparity in Old Navy's pricing of plus-sized clothing for different genders.
A spokeswoman for Gap, which owns Old Navy, said that women's plus-sized clothing costs more because it has special features that men's apparel doesn't.
"Old Navy is proud to offer styles and apparel designed specifically for our plus-size female customer, which includes curve-enhancing and curve-flattering elements such as four-way stretch materials and contoured waistbands, which most men's garments do not include," Gap spokesperson Debbie Felix told The Huffington Post in an email Tuesday.
"This higher price point reflects this selection of unique fabrics and design elements," she added. (Gap spokeswoman Liz Nunan gave an identical statement to BuzzFeed).
"This overtly discriminatory pricing policy indicates sexism and sizeism on the part of Old Navy that is unfair to women of size and unacceptable to me as a consumer of Old Navy's products," the Change.org petition says.
A look at Old Navy's website confirms that the company charges plus-size women more for the same item than the "regular" size, at least some of the time.
But for men, a pair of "Men's Premium Slim-Straight Jeans" is the same price whether or not you purchase the plus size.

Ask Matt: Will Apple Watch kill FossilAP
Q: Will Apple Watch kill Fossil?
A: Apple’s (AAPL) much-watched watch isn’t due until next year. But investors are already wondering how watch makers will fare with this giant new rival.
Analysts warned Fossil (FOSL) could be in the cross-hairs of the Apple Watch, when it’s finally released. Fossil gets about 80% of its revenue from watches. And Apple isn’t targeting the Rolex market with its debut in the wearable computing market. The Apple Watch is expected to sell at or around $350, putting it at or a bit above the price range of more fashion oriented watch companies, like Fossil.  During the year, analysts have warned Fossil’s watch business could be in peril due to the rise of smartwatches.
But if the days are truly numbered for Fossil’s watch business, that didn’t show up in third-quarter results. Net sales of watches rose 12%. Partly due to strength in watches, Fossil reported a quarterly profit of $1.96 a share, topping expectations by 8%. And despite fears about the watch business, Fossil’s earnings are expected to grow 9% next year.
Investors, though, need to keep their eye on this one. Sportbands like Microsoft’s Band continue to get more smartwatch functionality. Apple’s watch is due out next year. And Fossil seems to recognize the importance of this: It formed  watch partnership with chipmaker Intel this year.

Stocks closed slightly higher Thursday as the Dow managed to post another record closing high but the S&P 500 fell just short.
In up and down trading, stocks initially jumped on better-than-expected Walmart earnings and news of several corporate deals. But the gains were cut as plunging oil prices dragged the energy sector lower.
Oil prices fell below $75 a barrel for the first time in four years as benchmark U.S. crude dropped $2.97, or 4%, to close at $74.21 Thursday. It is down 31% since late June to its lowest level since September of 2010.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.50 points, or 0.2%, to a record close of 17,652.79 and hit a new intraday record of 17,705.48.  The Dow was led higher by Walmart (WMT ) after the nation's largest retailer reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. Walmart shares jumped 4.7% to $82.94.
Walmart beats estimates for third quarter
The Standard & Poor's 500 index eked out a gain of 1.08 points to 2039.33, just shy of its record close of 2039.68 set Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.01 points, or 0.1%, to 4680.14.
Energy stocks taking a hit on falling oil prices: ExxonMobil (XOM) dropped 0.8% to $94.66 and Chevron (CVX) fell 1% to $116.45.
In corporate merger news:
• Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA , BRKB ) announced it is buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble (PG) in a deal valued at $4.7 billion.
• Shares of Dreamworks Animation (DWA) surged 14% to $25.52 on reports that toymaker Hasbro (HAS) was in talks to buy the film studio. Hasbro was down 4.3% to $54.98.
Report: Hasbro in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation
"There's been a lot of momentum (up) in recent weeks, and a pause is probably a healthy development," said Jim Russell, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor, an investment firm. "We can see a scenario in which the market takes a time out, and reconsolidates for few days."
Overseas, Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1.1% to close at 17,392.79, as machinery orders there rose 2.9% over the previous month, defying predictions of a decline. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.3% to 24,019.94 and the Shanghai composite fell 0.4% to 2485.61.
European benchmarks were higher, with Britain's FTSE gaining 0.4% to 6635.45, Germany's DAX climbing 0.4% to 9248.51 and France's CAC 40 up 0.2% to 4187.95.
Wednesday, markets retreated slightly as six big banks were fined $4.3 billion in a settlement over foreign exchange manipulation charges, although the Nasdaq still managed to gain 0.3%.

Career Advice for the Office Holiday Partyreddit
Once thought gone for good, the office holiday party appears to be staging a comeback.  While these parties offer you the opportunity to socialize with your business associates in an informal setting -- make no mistake about it, they are business events!  I've witnessed and heard many people commit career suicide due to their inappropriate behavior and conversation at these functions.  Following are some tips I remind my clients of to insure they utilize these business holiday events as a career enhancer -- not a career de-stabilizer!
1. Office holiday events are really business events masquerading as parties!  It is easy to be seduced into forgetting you are with business associates because the atmosphere might be lively, you are dancing to great music, eating delicious food and the booze is flowing.  It is imperative to remember that regardless of the location and atmosphere of your party, the people in attendance are all related to some aspect of your career, i.e., they are your colleagues, clients, executives, etc. This fact doesn't change after the umpteenth drink. Therefore, avoid being lured into a false sense of camaraderie and familiarity.  Do not behave in any way or say anything that you would not say or do in a professional setting -- no inappropriate comments or off color jokes.
2. Don't even think about blowing off this party! Go to the office holiday party and work the room to the best of your ability.  Although many companies (albeit, not all of them) suggest attendance at these events are "optional", your absence may be noted and erroneously mis-interpreted.  The last thing you want to do is give the impression you are not a team player! Therefore, attend these parties, regardless of how "optional" they might have been advertised! Once you are there, use this party as a networking opportunity and do your best to make sure you say hello to as many people as possible. Even if you don't know some of the other attendees well, or you interact with them minimally, everyone can be wished a happy holiday season.  If it is at all possible, make a conscious yet subtle effort to briefly interact with all the key players in your company.  This might be one of the few opportunities you have for face-to-face interaction(s) with them.
3. Dress appropriately for the occasion! The venue often dictates the dress code. If you are in doubt as to how formal or casual the party will be, make an inquiry.  Every office has that person who always seems to know these things -- so a little bit of investigation will go a long way in saving you the embarrassment of being over or under-dressed!  Additionally, office holiday parties are not the time to come slinking in with a ridiculously low-cut dress, nine inch high heels, or a skirt that is way too short! Casual attire does not mean dirty clothes, wrinkled shirts or ripped pants.  Be certain you are aware of how formal the affair is and dress accordingly.
4. Moderation is the operative word of the day/night!  All behavior in moderation. Yes, you are at a party and I'm not trying to be a kill joy but the office holiday party is first and foremost a business function.  You are not attending this event for the food, the music, the dancing, although they might be first-rate and should be enjoyed.  Avoid overdrinking -- period.  Nobody fondly remembers the next day the person dancing on the bar with a lampshade on his or her head, or the person vomiting in the parking lot.  Conversation about business and your professional role specifically should be kept to a minimum. If you are asked about your work, keep your answer short and sweet -- nobody wants to hear the specifics of anything you are doing; definitely don't bore others with your achievements.  Try to be authentic and compliment others - most people can pick out a phony person a mile away!
Regardless of whether you love these holiday office parties or not, it is a smart career move to attend them and behavior appropriately.  Use them as an opportunity to socialize with people whom you normally don't get a chance to relax with during the course of the year!
All success begins with relationships; use the office holiday party as a way to initiate and/or solidify your business relationships!

Call across parties: what of othercasesPrint
Written by Ruwa Shah | Srinagar | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:15 am
Mainstream J&K parties and moderate separatists welcomed the sentencing for the Machil killings but the hardline faction of the Hurriyat, led by Syed Ali Geelani, said the decision was not enough. And all parties referred to other cases of alleged human rights violation by the armed force in the valley.
“This is a positive development and our party welcomes the Army’s judgment,” said Naeem Akhtar, PDP spokesperson. “We look forward to justice in all other cases such as the Pathribal fake encounter and Kunan-Poshpora mass rape, in which justice remains to be done.”
For the Congress, national spokesman Salman Soz said, “We welcome this decision and the criminals should be punished.”
BJP spokesman Khalid Jahangir noted this is the first time action has been taken against Army men. “It is a slap on the face of the Congress which was only talking about human rights cases. It is because of PM Narendra Modi that justice has been done.”
For the moderate faction of Hurriyat Conference, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, said, “This is the first case in which the Army has done justice to Kashmiris. Similar justice should be done in all other cases.”
The hardline faction of the Huriyat, headed by Syed Ali Geelani, said there are thousands of such cases. “When justice is done to all people of the valley, only then will we be satisfied,” Geelani said.
Amnesty
Amnesty International India too welcomed recent measures taken by Army authorities.
“The military court verdict in the Machil case should be followed by justice for the many other cases of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir,” said Shailesh Rai, programmes director at Amnesty International India. “Too often, military authorities dismiss the complaints they receive about human rights violations. The Pathribal case was also a reminder that the military justice system do not always lead to justice… For justice to be the rule and not the exception, all cases of human rights violations should be investigated and prosecuted by independent civilian authorities. ”
The Other Cases
Pathribal, 2000: Five days after the massacre of 35 Sikhs in Chittisinghpora, Army officers announced killing of five men they described as the “LeT militants responsible”. Exhumation of the bodies and tests later showed these were men who had disappeared from three villages. Govt suspended a few police officers but later reinstated them. CBI took up case, which reached SC. In 2012, Army agreed to a court-martial, which in 2014 cleared the accused officers.
Ganderbal encounter, 2006: Four villagers were abducted, killed in a fake encounter and dubbed foreign militants. Police probe found police and Army officers involved. The police officers were arrested and prosecuted, but the Army cited AFSPA. After a Supreme Court order, Army held court-martial and cleared the officers.
Kunan-Poshpora rapes, 1991: Army allegedly raped more than 40 women in Kunan and Poshpora villages in Kupwara. Army denies the charge and the case is in court. In other rape cases (1997 in Anantnag and 1999 in Rafiabad), defence ministry sanction for prosecution yet to come in.
Jalil Andrabi murder, 1996: J&K police held Major Avtar Singh guilty of involvement in 11 killings, including of human rights lawyer Andrabi. Chargesheet filed in 2001. Army told court that they would go for court-martial proceedings. In 2012, the major committed suicide after killing his family in the US.
Bomai killings, 2009: Two killed at Bomai village of Sopore. Army claimed they died in cross-fire, state probe held Army responsible for the killings. The Army refused to depose before the inquiry commission citing AFSPA. Army camp was later shifted.
Kupwara killings, 2005-06: Soldiers of 6 RR mistook three boys aged between 10 and 16 for militants and killed them at Bangargund village in Kupwara. The Army regretted the killings. No action taken. In 2006, Army killed four boys played cricket at Doodhipora in Kupwara. Case on in HC.

Bank overdraft fees range from $5 to $45  survey says0
In August 2013, four Premier officers and directors, including Chairman Zulfikar Esmail, were accused of defrauding the U.S. government, including using the TARP funds to keep an alleged criminal enterprise running at the bank.
On Friday, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program announced that new charges had been brought, including against Esmail, that involve defrauding Itasca-based First Midwest Bank, another TARP recipient, over an $8 million loan that went into default.
A lawyer for Esmail declined to comment Monday.
Investigations by the special inspector general have resulted in $7.4 billion in court orders and settlements against people who committed crimes or otherwise caused losses to the taxpayer-supported Treasury program, according to a nearly 600-page report issued Oct. 29 by the watchdog.
TARP was started in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and was intended to get financial institutions lending again after credit froze up, but there were people whom the government later went after in civil or criminal actions for causing losses to what was commonly known as the bank bailout program.
Some of the settlements have involved the seizure of hard assets.
Among them: dozens of vehicles; more than 30 properties; including one in the Cayman Islands; bags of silver; collector coins; artwork; antique furniture; Civil War memorabilia; and Western Union money orders with the "Pay to" field blank.
One executive who pleaded in a bank fraud scheme, for example, agreed to forfeit proceeds from the sale of a 1948 Pontiac Silver Streak and a 1957 Cadillac.
The report said vehicles ordered to be forfeited also include: a Kubota tractor; watercraft, including a 2005 Scout Dorado; a 1969 Shelby Mustang; a 1932 Ford Model A; a 1954 Cadillac Eldorado convertible; a 1963 Rolls Royce; a 1965 Shelby Cobra; a 2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK 350 4Matic; a 2005 Hummer H2; and a 1958 Mercedes-Benz Cabriolet 220.

Campbell paid $3.05 million in 2009 for the Lincoln Park mansion from its builder. Even after leaving the Blackhawks, he kept the mansion for several years. He first listed it in May for $2.895 million and later cut his asking price to $2.795 million and then to $2.749 million before going under contract in September.
Features include 4-1/2 baths, a great room with built-ins and a fireplace, a wine cellar, a master suite with an infinity tub, a wet bar on the third floor that opens to two outdoor spaces, and a built-in outdoor kitchen with a pizza oven and a fireplace.

Banks Fined $3.4 Billion For Trying To Manipulate Foreign Exchange MarketsPrevious Story

LONDON (AP) — Traders with nicknames like the "Three Musketeers" and the "A-Team" plotted over Internet chat rooms to manipulate currency markets for years, profiting at the expense of clients — and then congratulating themselves for their brilliance — regulators said Wednesday, as they fined five banks $3.4 billion.
Using profanity-laced banter, the traders coordinated their financial positions in the multi-trillion dollar currency market, securing profits for those inside their circles. "YESsssssssssss," one of them wrote in a chat message. "Yeah baby" and "nice work gents....I don my hat," wrote others, according to documents of their exchanges.
Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC Bank and UBS agreed to settlements totaling almost $3.4 billion with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. The British regulator said Barclays remains under investigation.
"Today's record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found, and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right," said Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA. "They must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits."
Meanwhile, a U.S. Treasury Department agency announced it was fining three of the biggest U.S. banks — JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. — a total $950 million for failing to prevent misconduct in their foreign-exchange trading operations.
Some $5.3 trillion changes hands every day on the global foreign exchange market, with 40 percent of trades occurring in London. The market is loosely regulated and dominated by a few elite banks.
Manipulation of the exchange rates has "a profound effect on the economy," CFTC Enforcement Director Aitan Goelman said. That's because a host of financial investments bought and sold by major investors like pension funds are based on benchmark rates for pairs of currencies that are fixed daily by the banks.
With so much money flowing through the currency markets, a rigged procedure of fixing exchange rates can ripple through the financial system, the regulators say, and it also shakes people's confidence in the fairness and integrity of the system.
The alleged manipulation occurred around the market fixes, moments during the day when banks set benchmark prices for currency trades around the world.
The penalty notices for each bank contain specific examples in which traders manipulated the market to the benefit of their firms.
In one example, RBS had net client orders to sell British pounds for dollars. This meant the bank would profit if it were able to push the price of pounds lower. An RBS trader used an online chat room to share information with traders at three other firms, allowing him to increase RBS's net sell orders to 399 million pounds from 202 million pounds and to push the price on the spot market as low as $1.6213 from $1.6276. The fix was eventually set at $1.6218.
As a result, RBS made a profit of $615,000.
In the aftermath, the RBS trader used the chat room to thank his compatriots, saying "1.6218 . nice." One of the other traders replied, "we ... killed it right," using an obscenity.
Louise Cooper, a former Goldman Sachs stock broker who writes the financial blog CooperCity, said that what was extraordinary about the case is the misconduct occurred when the banks were already under investigation for a similar scandal involving the fixing of the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR. The industry was well aware that a regulatory backlash was coming.
"I thought these were supposed to be the masters of the universe? Brilliantly clever individuals who were worth their multi-million pound bonuses," Cooper wrote.  "And yet they continued their behavior despite the clear signs they were likely to be discovered."
The regulators found that between Jan. 1, 2008 and Oct. 15, 2013, the five banks failed to adequately train and supervise currency traders. As a result, traders were able to form groups that shared information about client activity, using nicknames such as "the players" and "1team, 1 dream."
RBS Chairman Philip Hampton said the bank condemned the actions of the employees responsible.
"Today is a stark reminder of the importance of culture and integrity in banking and we will rightly be judged on the strength of our response," Hampton said. RBS has started disciplinary action against six employees, three of whom have been suspended.
The U.S. Justice Department is conducting its own criminal investigation of foreign-exchange rate setting. And the Federal Reserve confirmed Wednesday it has a probe underway in coordination with Justice and other agencies. Additional penalties are possible.
Criminal charges against individual bank executives couldn't come soon enough for some consumer advocates and critics of the financial industry.
"Banks do not commit crimes; bankers, executives, supervisors and traders do," Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that advocates strict regulation, said in a statement. "Yet not one single executive is being punished individually and none of the banks even have to admit wrongdoing or disclose the details of their misconduct."
The foreign-exchange scandal is the latest black eye for the industry. Five banks have been sanctioned for alleged manipulation of LIBOR, in a continuing investigation. The banks together have paid nearly $4 billion in settlements, and several individuals have been criminally charged.
LIBOR is an interest rate that affects trillions of dollars in contracts around the world, including mortgages and consumer loans.
Major Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have each paid billions of dollars in settlements with U.S. agencies over their role in selling the toxic mortgage securities that fueled the worst financial crisis since the 1930s and threw millions of homes into foreclosure.

The Significance of Options and Perspectivereddit
The most common issue I run across when speaking to people about their futures can be summarized in one word: options. There are always options. Many people seem to feel trapped, like they have no choice about what happens. Often the lack of options, at least the perception of no options, stems from circumstances that are either out of our control or totally in our control. Things like the weather, geographic limitations and the almighty dollar, or the lack of seem to be the most common causes.
I think we, as human beings sometimes get so involved in our own lives that we often get to a point where we are too close to be able to make decisions for ourselves that may seem obvious to others.  It's hard to keep perspective. Often we are able to look at the situations of others and make smart, well-thought analytical decisions for them, but when it comes to ourselves we don't apply the same filter or lens.
Life is a battlefield, there are many possible outcomes, and even within winning there are different levels of victory or degrees of glory. Military ground commanders will tell you that the key to a great battlefield win is air superiority. Having a birds-eye view allows you to see things from a unique perspective; you can see everything at once, allowing you to properly assess your situation.
Here are a few things you can do to get a birds-eye view of your battlefield and make the right decisions so you can have the most favorable outcomes.
1. Find a mentor. I always say you should never take advice from someone with whom you wouldn't switch places. Find a person that cannot only help you from a third party perspective, but that will also help you make awesome decisions.
Coaches, teachers, employers and trainers can all be mentors, the greatest athletes all have people to motivate and train them, if you want the best results, you need the best guidance regardless of the subject.
Being able to help yourself sometimes requires a different perspective; a mentor may just be what you need.
2. Study thoroughly someone you recognize as a success. This may be someone you'd even like as a mentor but perhaps don't have access to that person due to limitations of their time or the fact that they simply don't mentor people.
But rather than focus on the successes of these people, especially the material ones, look at the struggles, and if you look deep enough every truly successful person has had to make enormous risky sacrifices to be in the position they are today. I say thoroughly because outwardly the media tends to build people into either superheroes or into villains. Show me a winner and I'll show you someone with a great support team. We don't do it alone; there are lots of behind the scenes people that make businesses and teams work.
3. Perspective. Consider where you are in the world, chances are if you have access to this article and can read it in any language, let alone English, you probably have more options than 90 percent of the rest of the people on this earth.
The decisions we make today will create options, both now and in the future.  As you go throughout your day, remember, you always have options.

21 Surprising Facts You Never Knew About Warren Buffettreddit
By Elyssa Kirkham, Editor
A lot has been written about the Oracle of Omaha, from his famously prescient investments to his near-mythical origin story. But there are still a lot of things the general public doesn't know about Warren Buffett.
Find Out What Warren Buffett Carries in His Wallet
1. Warren Buffett loves junk food and eats 2,500 calories a day.
Buffett said on CNBC's Squawk Box that 2,500 calories is what he needs to consume daily to maintain his weight, but within that limit he eats whatever he wants. "If somebody told me that I live a year longer by eating nothing but broccoli and asparagus from now on," Buffett said, "every day will seem like as long. I'll stick with the Cheetos and the Coke."
2. Buffett's favorite meal is a cheeseburger with a Cherry Coke.
3. Buffett actually bought Berkshire Hathaway so he could fire its CEO.
In 1964, Buffett and the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, then an Omaha clothing mill, agreed on a price for the company to buy back shares from Buffett. But when the official offer from Berkshire Hathaway came in at 12.5 cents per share lower than agreed upon, Buffett instead bought up a controlling share of the business and fired the CEO.
4. A salad dressing scandal set the stage for one of Warren Buffett's biggest investment wins.
In 1963, a vegetable oil and salad dressing company borrowed $175 million ($1.2 billion today) from lenders like American Express against its inventory of oil. Unfortunately, the loans were fraudulent, as much of the the collateral oil was actually water with a bit of oil floating on top.
American Express lost millions on the deal and its stock fell 50 percent, according to Investing Answers. Buffett saw an opportunity and snatched up $13 million worth of AmEx shares, which soon recovered and grew in value over the years. They're worth $7.8 billion as of 2011.
5. Investing $443 million in Dexter Shoe Inc. was " the worst deal that I've made ," Warren Buffett said.
He bought the shoe company with Berkshire stock in 1993, and the business lost its competitive edge soon after.
6. The Oracle of Omaha predicted his own wealth.
"I always knew I was going to be rich," Buffett said. "I don't think I ever doubted it for a minute."
7. Buffett's three children and their philanthropic efforts are his biggest source of satisfaction in life.
"I would say the most satisfying thing actually is watching my three children each pick up on their own interests," Buffett said , "and work many more hours per week than most people that have jobs at trying to intelligently give away that money in fields that they particularly care about." His children, Susan Buffett, Howard Buffett and Peter Buffett, run their own charity foundations.
8. He has donated a total of $25 billion to charities.
He gives most generally to his kids' foundations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Buffett has pledged to give away 99 percent of his wealth rather than pass it down as an inheritance.

9. Warren Buffett carries an ancient Nokia flip phone.
He forgoes the latest and greatest smart phones in favor of the serviceable model. "This is the one Alexander Graham Bell gave me," Warren Buffett joked on the Piers Morgan Show. It's all part of his frugality, he said: "I don't throw anything away until I've had it 20 or 25 years."
10. Buffett has only sent one email in his life.
It was sent to Jeff Raikes of Microsoft, and Buffett said it became his first and last email when it ended up in court.
11. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett share a favorite book.
It's a collection of New Yorker pieces titled Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street, written by John Brook and first published in 1969. Buffett shared the book with Bill Gates in 1991, and Gates still calls it "the best business book I've ever read."
12. He mulls over investments in the bath.
That's where he thought through his plan to invest in Bank of America, according to CNBC's Becky Quick. "He says he just dreamt this idea up on Wednesday morning while he was in the bathtub," Quick said. Buffett bought $5 billion in BofA shares in 2011.
13. Warren Buffett spends 80 percent of his days reading.
"I just sit in my office and read all day," Buffett told The Week. "Look, my job is essentially just corralling more and more and more facts and information, and occasionally seeing whether that leads to some action." He read even more in his early career, working his way through 600 to 1,000 pages a day.
14. Gold is a bad investment with no real value, according to Buffett.
As he put it in a 1998 speech, the precious metal "gets dug out of the ground in Africa or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it."
"It has no utility," Buffett said. "Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head."
15. Buffett made his first stock purchase in 1941, when he was just 11 years old.
He bought six shares of Cities Service for him and his sister, Doris. He learned one of his first lessons in patience; the stock fell right after he bought it, then rose again to slightly more per share than what he paid. He sold their shares, after which they jumped 500 percent, from $40 a share to $200 a share.
16. 99 percent of Warren Buffett's wealth was earned after his 50th birthday.
Buffett is worth $63 billion today, but on his 50th birthday, he was worth just $300 million, according to The Motley Fool. That means he made $62.7 billion, or 99 percent, of his wealth in the years since.
17. For his first job, Buffett delivered newspapers for The Washington Post.
As a paper boy, he delivered nearly 500,000 copies of the paper to his neighbors in Omaha and made $175 a month.
18. As a young man, his investments included a farm and a pinball machine.
Buffett bought a 40-acre Omaha farm as a high school sophomore. His senior year he bought a used pinball machine and set it up at a local barber shop, and within months had expanded the venture to three machines. Within a year he had sold the pinball business for $1,200.
19. Playing bridge online is his favorite way to unwind.
Buffett plays under the name "T-Bone," and has even competed in a tournament against fellow billionaire Bill Gates.
20. As an adolescent, Warren Buffett was a troublemaker.
He stole sports goods from the local Sears, got horrible grades and even ran away from home. He only straightened out after his father told him if he didn't he would lose his paper route.
21. Buffett joined Twitter in March 2013.
His first tweet reads, " Warren is in the house ."

Pay-to-Play Restrictions on Government Contracting Under Assaultreddit
One of the most successful regulations for curtailing political corruption -- restrictions on those seeking government contracts from making campaign contributions to public officials and candidates responsible for awarding those contracts -- is under fire in the courts.
Government contractors who want to dole out campaign contributions, and political parties who want their candidates to receive large amounts of contractor campaign donations, have filed lawsuits against the federal pay-to-play law and a separate long-standing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule restricting campaign contributions from Wall Street firms seeking state and municipal financial services contracts. The legal challenges could soon be headed to the Roberts Court, which so far hasn't met a campaign finance law it likes.
Pay-to-play is the all-too-common practice of a business entity making campaign contributions to a public official with the hope of gaining a lucrative government contract. Rarely does pay-to-play constitute outright bribery for a government contract. Rather, pay-to-play usually involves a business entity endearing itself and buying access for consideration of a government contract.
Throughout federal, state and local jurisdictions, it is widely believed by contractors and the public alike that making campaign contributions to those responsible for issuing government contracts is a key factor in influencing who wins those contracts. Actual sting operations have recorded public officials trading contracts for campaign contributions, for example, by former Governors Rod Blagojevich in Illinois and John Rowland in Connecticut, both of whom are sitting in prison. Just as tellingly, strong correlations between campaign contributors and those who were awarded government contracts under the local administrations of former Mayors Jeremy Harris in Honolulu and John Street in Philadelphia have led to corruption investigations and convictions. The SEC has documented numerous cases of investment managers orchestrating campaign contributions in exchange for lucrative contracts to manage government investments or pension funds. And, of course, surveys of businesses have shown that many contractors believe they must pay to play and that the public perceives such a corrupt culture in government contracting.
Following these and other high profile scandals and convictions, the federal government, the SEC, 15 states and several agencies and localities have restricted campaign contributions from government contractors. The SEC rules affecting Wall Street, and the state laws of Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey, are the strongest and most effective of pay-to-play restrictions -- each of them enacted closely on the heels of scandal. The "best" pay-to-play restrictions define government contractors as not just the business itself, but also its owners and senior management combined; restrict contributions well before contract negotiations begin and well after termination of the contract; and mandate that contractors themselves document and certify compliance among their senior management -- a disclosure task too burdensome for government officials.
So far, the courts have firmly stood behind pay-to-play laws and regulations. As early as the 1995 Blount v. SEC decision and more recently in the 2010 Green Party of Connecticut v. Garfield decision, the courts have recognized the grave potential for corruption in government contracting and have upheld pay-to-play laws and rules as narrowly tailored remedies to a very real and specific problem.
But that hasn't stopped the lawsuits. Buoyed by the hostile shift of today's Supreme Court against campaign finance laws, contractors are challenging the federal law that applies to federal contractors ( Wagner v. FEC ) and the New York and Tennessee Republican parties are challenging the SEC rule that applies to state financial service contractors ( New York Republican State Committee v. SEC ). The latter case has ramifications for the 2016 presidential race. Some of the GOP contenders -- Chris Christie and Rick Perry, for example -- are sitting governors responsible for awarding pension fund management contracts to Wall Street and thus prohibited from receiving Wall Street campaign cash.
So far, pay-to-play restrictions are faring well in the lower courts. On September 30, oral arguments in the Wagner case were presented to a federal appeals court, which expressed skepticism to the challenge. On the same day, a federal district court in the New York Republican case determined that plaintiffs filed in the wrong court and must re-file in the federal appeals court.
As inconvenient as pay-to-play restrictions may be for some politicians, it is imperative that the courts continue to acknowledge the long, sordid record of pay-to-play corruption and recognize that restrictions on campaign contributions from government contractors to those who can influence the awarding of contracts are narrowly tailored and just make common sense.
Pay-to-play not only damages the public's confidence in government; it often ends up hurting government officials, endangering otherwise promising careers, and causing the legitimate business community to think twice about engaging in government services.
Pay-to-play is a costly problem for government, taxpayers, businesses and the public alike that can be checked with appropriate constraints against the exchange of campaign cash for government contracts. Pay-to-play restrictions constitute desperately-needed government contracting reform -- designed to preserve the integrity of the government contracting process and save taxpayer dollars -- not campaign finance reform. Even the Roberts Court may well see this.

Family of Ebola victim look for closure indealsThe fiancee and family of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan hope a settlement and a book deal will provide closure.
By: Associated Press | Fort Worth | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:20 am
The fiancee and family of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan hope a settlement and a book deal will provide closure after his death.
Two publishers announced Thursday that Duncan’s fiancee Louise Troh is writing a memoir for release in April. The news came a day after an attorney for Duncan’s parents and four children said the family had reached a settlement with the Dallas hospital where Duncan died last month.
The deal includes an undisclosed payment to the family and the creation of a charitable fund in the Liberian man’s name.
Troh, who wasn’t part of the settlement, says she’ll use part of the book proceeds for a down payment on a new home.
Duncan’s nephew wants the fund used to build a hospital in Liberia specializing in infectious disease.

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar along with P L Punia of Congress, six Samajwadi Party and two BSP leaders were elected unopposed to Rajya Sabha for 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh on Thursday.
Former Goa CM Parrikar, who was inducted into the Union Cabinet this week, had filed his nomination papers on November 10, the same day he had taken oath of office in Delhi. Parrikar could not come to take his victory certificate, which was instead taken by BJP state president Laxmikant Bajpai.
Those elected from ruling Samajwadi Party included senior SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav, Tazeen Fatima, wife of SP minister Azam Khan; Neeraj Shekhar, son of former PM Chandrashekhar, Ravi Prakash Verma, Chandrapal Singh Yadav and Javed Ali Khan. BSP leaders Rajaram and Veer Singh were also elected unopposed along with Congress leader Punia.

No connection with Budgam  saysArmyPrint
Written by Pranav Kulkarni | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:19 am
The Army has stressed that the timing of the sentencing in the Machil fake encounter has nothing to do with the ongoing inquiry against Army personnel for the recent Budgam killings. The Machil sentencing was completed two months ago, much before the Budgam killings, Lt Gen D S Hooda, Northern Army commander, told The Indian Express.
Massive protests have followed the killing of two youths — two others were injured — on November 3 when Army personnel fired at a car in Budgam. The Army later apologised for the incident and Lt Gen D S Hooda said last week that the Army would complete its inquiry in 10 days and also announced compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the families of the victims.
The sentencing for Machil has coincided with the protests over the Budgam killings and come at a time when the state is heading for elections. Sources in the Army, on the other hand, said the time-bound outcome of the process reiterates the efficiency of the justice system within the armed forces.
Hooda said, “The proceedings of the general court martial (Machil) were completed much before this (Budgam) incident… The general court martial proceedings have come to my headquarters and these have to be legally examined. The technical process is not yet complete.”
Headed by an officer of the rank of a brigadier, the GCM has awarded sentences to five personnel — two officers and three jawans — while exonerating a Territorial Army man.
Asked whether the Army would hand over to the police any of its personnel in connection with the killing of two youths at Budgam, Hooda said, “We had said on November 7 that the inquiry will take 10 days. Let the inquiry be done and we will see.”
What next
CONFIRMATION: The sentence will have to be be confirmed by the confirming authority, in this case the office of Northern Army commander Lt Gen D S Hooda. This will likely take another month.
APPEAL: The accused can move a pre-confirmation petition with the authority, or file a post-confirmation petition if confirmed. They can also approach the Armed Forces Tribunal challenging the decision of the general court martial, followed by a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court.
IMPRISONMENT: There being no military prisons in India, the convicts will be sent to civil prisons

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

Indian origin jihadist skips bail  flees UK for IslamicStateAn Indian-origin Islamist activist facing trial on terrorism charges skipped bail and fled UK.
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 3:04 am
An Indian-origin Islamist activist facing trial on terrorism charges skipped bail and fled the country with his family on Wednesday, headed through Paris to the Islamic State, British media have reported.  The escape, first revealed by The Daily Mail, came after Abu Rumaysah failed to surrender his passport, a condition of his bail, and has led to opposition charges of police incompetence.
Born Siddhartha Dhar, to a family Indian diplomatic sources in London told The Indian Express was of Bihar-Bengal origin, Abu Rumaysah had been arrested in September along with nine others, on charges of inciting terrorism, as part of an ongoing investigation of the London-based pro-jihadist group al-Muhajiroun.
Indian diplomatic sources said authorities in the United Kingdom had not requested any information on Rumaysah’s links, and there did not appear to be any connection between his radicalisation and his country of origin.  The sources added that there was no recorded of Rumaysah having visited India in the past several years.
Al-Muhajiroun, led by Bangladesh-origin Islamist Anjem Chowdhuri, has been at the forefront of campaigning for the Islamic State in the United Kingdom—mainly in public.  Rumaysah, who sources said converted to Islam during his teens and had long been estranged from his family, was a key member of the group and its offshoots, organising roadshows that sought to convert troubled youth to the cause.
It was at one of these that he is believed to have met, and possibly mentored, Michael Adebolajo, who beheaded British soldier Lee Rigby on a London street.
Rumaysah had, several times in the past, offered to renounce his citizenship if he was allowed to travel to the territories in Iraq and Syria now held by the Islamic State. In an interview given to the United Kingdom’s Channel 4 in August, Rumaysah said he “would love to live under the Islamic State and under the shariah”.
In a lecture delivered in September, laden with communal invective, Rumaysah praised Adolf Hitler for seeking to crush a purported Jewish conspiracy he described as “this evil thing”.  He added that Zionists had “no regard for human life”, citing as evidence the prominence of Jews in the medical profession, which he alleged dispensed drugs which have “adverse side-effects”.
He also blamed Jews for the rise of Shi’a Islam—who the Islamic State and other Sunni Islamists claim are heretics, and have targeted in large-scale killings across West Asia and Pakistan—saying the mother of its founder had belonged to the faith.
In a November interview to the BBC’s popular ‘60 Minutes’ programme, Rumaysah also defended Muslim vigilante groups charged with attacking women and homosexuals.  “I want to see every single woman in this country covered from head to toe,”  he said “I want to the see the hand of the thief cut. I want to see adulterers stoned to death.”

A Working Fathers ResponseEditor's note: The following blog post is a response to the Huffington Post blogger Regan Long's " A Working Mother's Plea to the President ."
Dear Regan:
I was truly moved by your anguish about leaving your new baby home so you could return to your teaching job, and while your letter was directed to President Obama and not me, I wanted to respond.
I have three kids myself.  Mine are a little older -- the oldest just went away to college -- so they need me a little less than yours need you. I know the guilt you feel, though.  And I can tell you that your children won't blame you for going out to earn a living and keep a roof over their heads.
I agree with you -- we don't do nearly enough in this country to help working families balance all the competing demands on their time.  It's as shocking to me as it is to you that we're the only industrialized country without paid family leave.  I was just in Germany where I met a young American working for an IT company there -- he doesn't want to return to the U.S. because he and his wife have started a family and they need the paid leave.
I've talked to a lot of families like yours facing difficult choices. Just a few weeks ago, I sat down for lunch with two families who wrote to me about the emotional and physical stress of having to go back to work before they are ready. How can we tell someone to take a huge financial hit unless they go back to work only a few weeks after an emergency C-section? The financial strain doesn't get easier as a child gets a little older -- as the president recently pointed out, day care can cost more than tuition at a public university.
So much has changed in recent decades -- the influx of women into the workforce, modernizing gender roles, new family structures -- it makes no sense that our laws haven't kept up with social and economic change. In the second decade of the 21st century, why are we still living by Leave it to Beaver rules?
You shouldn't have to win the boss lottery in order to have a little bit of flexibility at work.  Raising and supporting a family isn't just a financial obligation.  What's important isn't just being able to put food on the dinner table -- we want you to be at the dinner table, too. The most important family value of all is time with your family.
From a policymaking perspective, we're slowly making progress on this issue. So far, Rhode Island, New Jersey, California and several cities have passed paid leave laws. And earlier this month, Massachusetts passed a state paid leave referendum.  So did the cities of Trenton and Montclair, New Jersey.  With compelling voices like yours speaking up, Regan, we can push to make paid family leave the law of the land.
Thank you for sharing your story.  And all the best to you and your family.
Sincerely,

Escalation: A Failure of Sortsreddit
The word "escalation" is used as a threat in many organizations.  The reason that this term is often communicated as a weapon is that individuals will use an escalation to yield a desired result --- if action isn't taken to meet an individual's needs.  However, escalation shouldn't be used as a threat.  Escalation - instead - should be used as a final invitation to negotiate prior to moving an issue to the next level for review.
Escalation is a failure; a failure of individuals to communicate or resolve an issue at the working level of the involved parties.  Therefore, individuals involved in conflict should actively attempt to understand others' viewpoint(s) prior to an escalation, which will help each side to identify, analyze and address potential negotiating points to move past a stalemate.
Additional actions that should be taken prior to an escalation:
Meet privately with significantly impacted parties to understand the issue(s) that prevent an agreement  from being reached.
Ensure confidentiality of the discussion(s) by agreeing to only release the substance of the conversation.  This is an important process step to properly set expectations, along with an ability to engage in open and honest communication.  Then, don't release any information related to personal feelings or beliefs shared during the discussion, as it will be very difficult to regain or maintain future trust.
Seek to understand the issue(s) that prevent agreement without aligning with any particular individual(s) or position(s).
Identify any concern(s) or sticking point(s) that may be critical to a solution's development.  Then, explore these points further to identify any opportunities for compromise.  The objective is to identify the source(s) of the conflict and determine ways to minimize, eliminate or overcome any objection(s).
Develop a list of potential holding points, trade-offs or concessions.  This is a list of items that individuals aren't willing to negotiate, might be willing to compromise with additional discussion, or might be willing to remove the objection(s), respectively.
Once the positions are understood, this information can be used to develop potential options based on compromise.  The goal isn't to - necessarily - obtain everything an individual might want to feel whole.  The objective should be to move individuals closer to a mutually beneficial solution, which is a critical step to reach a solution prior to escalation.
Whether or not there is an agreement reached, acknowledge and thank the individual(s) for their contribution(s).  However, it's important that nobody gloats about any position(s) succeeded by others during negotiations, as this may damage an ability to reach future agreements based on compromise.
If an agreement still cannot be reached, the issue might need to be reviewed by the next level to resolve a stalemate.
Regardless of the outcome, extra effort should be exerted to resolve issues at a working level -- as these types of negotiations are beneficial to resolve future conflicts.  Furthermore, conflicts that use this process can be leveraged to develop long-term, cooperative and mutually beneficial working relationships.

Why everyone is freaking out about what shirt a scientist woreBritish physicist Matt Taylor broke down in tears on Friday as he apologized for wearing a shirt featuring a collage of pinup girls in various states of undress. (AP)
Wednesday, Matt Taylor did one very good thing and one very bad thing.
He was part of the team that landed a robot on a comet for the first time. That's awesome, and he's clearly a great scientist.
But Taylor made a decision that the Internet is (rightfully) a-twitter over: He wore a shirt covered in busty, scantily clad women when he went to brief the media. We've reached out to the European Space Agency for comment on this, but haven't heard back -- and Taylor has yet to respond to any of the rage online.
#ThatShirt is a problem, because it shows that Taylor thinks women are a punchline. It shows @esa doesn't notice casual misogyny.

#ThatShirt is a problem because of what it says about society. "How do I look cool and fun? Oh, I'll degrade women. That'll do it."

There have been a few lackluster reactions to this that miss the point. It's been argued that a woman made the shirt for him (women are capable of making sexist shirts too), that he's actually a great example of a cool scientist who breaks the white lab coat mold (which is important in encouraging kids to get into science, to be fair), that he changed after the first press briefing he did in the shirt (true!), and that we in the United States have no right to inflict our stiff cultural norms on the rest of the world.

Look, I'm glad that Taylor got as far as he's gotten without anyone discriminating against him for being covered in tattoos. I'm covered in tattoos! Science nerds can be covered in tattoos. Ink doesn't prohibit the doing of science.
I also love that Taylor has a quirky style, because it's true that scientists are often stereotyped as being stuffy and unapproachable. Projects like "This is What a Scientist Looks Like" try to undermine that longstanding image by showing people that scientists are real people who do things that don't require goggles sometimes.
But Taylor wasn't wearing a geeky t-shirt or a fluorescent green jumper. His shirt wasn't just quirky -- it was sexist. Shirts covered in half-naked women should not be worn in the workplace, because it sends a clear message to the women around you -- their bodies are really just there for display.
So maybe it was a mistake that Taylor wore the shirt on camera. He may not have realized he had it on. But he still wore it to work, and that's the real problem -- especially in science and technology, where women already face an uphill battle of workplace and industry sexism and rampant sexual assault .
Alice Bell put it pretty succinctly for the Guardian :
Taylor recently joined  an online chat with the Wall Street Journal . In response to a question over how he was accepted in science with his tattoos with: “The people I work with don’t judge me by my looks but only by the work I have done and can do. Simple.” As  a post at Business Insider dryly noted  “If only women could hope to someday be judged that way too.”
Meanwhile, the New York Times is publishing op-eds that claim there's no sexism in science .
No one is saying that Taylor isn't a good scientist, or that he should be dragged through the mud for his miss-hap. But when these things happen, we need to talk about them -- and the men involved need to listen.

Hachette, Amazon reach deal on book sales after fight
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 10.44PM IST
(After six months in which…)
WASHINGTON: Publisher Hachette and online retailing giant Amazon said Thursday they had reached a deal to end their acrimonious feud over online book sales.
After six months in which Amazon clamped down on sales of books by the publisher on its website, the two announced a multi-year agreement on ebook and print book sales in the US market.
The deal gives Hachette Book Group, a subsidiary of France's Lagardere group, the responsibility for setting retail prices for ebooks beginning in early 2015, according to an announcement from both companies.
No specific terms for the deal were released, but the statement said Hachette would have incentives to keep its prices low.
"This is great news for writers," said Michael Pietsch, chief executive of Hachette Book Group.
"It gives Hachette enormous marketing capability with one of our most important bookselling partners."
David Naggar, vice president for Kindle, the ebook unit of Amazon, said the incentives for Hachette to hold prices down "will be a great win for readers and authors alike."

The High Density of Brazilian Production Chainsreddit
International trade has undergone a radical transformation in the past decades as production processes have fragmented along cross-border value chains. The Brazilian economy has remained on the fringes of this production revolution, maintaining a very high density of local supply chains. This article calls attention to the rising opportunity costs incurred by such option taken by the country.
Moving Tectonic Plates under the Global Economic Geography
In recent decades, international trade has gone through a revolution, with the wide extension of the organization of production in the form of cross-border value chains. This extension was a result of the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers, the incorporation of large swaths of workers in the global market economy in Asia and Central Europe, and technological innovations that allowed modularization and geographic distribution of production stages in a growing universe of activities. International trade has grown faster than world GDP and, within the former, the sales of intermediate products has risen faster than the sale of final goods.
The geography of industrial production has changed dramatically, with unskilled labor-intensive sectors moving out of advanced economies rapidly. Although the "hollowing out" of such jobs in advanced economies may have been, to a greater or lesser extent, determined by biases in trends of technological progress, the transfer of unskilled labor-intensive segments of supply chains has been part of the explanation. On the other side of such transfers, low-income countries have experienced rapid economic growth processes stemming from the structural transformation that has resulted from the large-scale migration of workers from subsistence to modern tradable activities.
Sharp changes in relative prices in the global economy have accompanied this process. While labor prices fell -- as well as prices of manufactured products, according to their labor intensiveness -- prices rose for natural resource-intensive goods, following an increase in demand coming from economically-growing low-income areas.
The logic of value chains was also extended to other sectors beyond manufacturing. Producers are opting for less self-sufficient, in-house capacities, choosing to sub-contract activities that are not essential to their business. This is also one reason for the expansion of services in GDP accounting in recent decades. Commodity chains have increasingly relied on sophisticated services both upstream and downstream. The content of services embedded in industrial products has also increased. Additionally, technological innovations have increased the marketability of various services, as expressed in the growth of international trade in services.
The opportunities and challenges of the international industrial division of labor are reconfigured in this new world of cross-border value chains. For low-income economies, one can say that it has become relatively easier -- especially for small countries -- to increase their local industrial production, since joining the market through labor-intensive segments of existing chains allows them to circumvent the limits of (a lack of) scale and sophistication in local markets. Nevertheless, such entry is volatile and can easily be undone and relocated soon after any adverse signal comes out. This process of entry -- with easy exit -- corresponds to a window of opportunity for local accumulation of skills and a leap forward.
For high- and middle-income economies, in turn, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain competitiveness in those segments. It should also be noted though that some technological trajectories currently in early stage -- such as 3D printing -- may require the substitution of qualified for unqualified labor in a wide range of segments of existing chains, partly reversing the spatial dynamics described above.
Middle-income economies are also facing a new landscape in other aspects. On the one hand, technological spillovers, productivity increases, and wider market access are now facilitated via entry at points that require intermediate sophistication levels within existing value chains. On the other, the consolidation of existing value chains raises the stakes in terms of the competition for core positions. For consolidated and mature branches, creating new chains and challenging established ones is the only alternative.
Foreign Trade Statistics and Value-Added Trade
The statistics of exports and imports no longer serve as a gauge of how countries' foreign trade affects their allocation of factors of production. With the fragmentation of production systems and the back-and-forth cross-border movement of products at intermediate stages, one cannot ignore multiple accounting, either within a sector or in other branch in which they serve as inputs.
Only recently have data on sector-specific added-value country exports started to become available, thanks to a joint OECD-WTO initiative, ( OECD/WTO, 2013) where one can find information on sector-specific gross exports minus imports in the same industry and from other lines of the input-output matrix of a country. Results are often very different from those visualized with statistics of gross exports and imports ( Canuto, 2013 ).
For example, the database of trade in added value of OECD/WTO reveals that once the content of services embedded in other branches is taken into account, international trade volumes are much larger than the 25 percent suggested by gross trade figures -- see Figure 1. They account for over fifty percent of total exports in countries like the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy and, perhaps surprisingly, almost a third in China. In fact, as shown in Hoekman & Jackson (2013) , domestic and imported services appear embedded in the various branches of manufacturing, mining and agricultural sectors. It follows that the quality of  services available to a country's industrial sector, whether domestic or imported, greatly affects the country's competitiveness.
Value-added trade statistics also give a view of how Brazil maintains a level of density in its chains of domestic industrial production above what one would expect in the case of a middle-income country. Figure 2 shows ratios of value added (VA) relative to gross exports (X) in various countries. China provides a particularly telling comparison point against Brazil. While the weight of commodities partly explains why the ratio is so high in the case of the total export bill (left side), the index is also very high in most manufacturing branches, as illustrated on the right side of Figure 2 in the case of machinery and equipment ( World Bank, 2014 ).
Brazil has remained outside the process of cross-border production fragmentation. There are few exceptions, like Embraer, which operates in the center of its own global value chain. The automotive Mercosur regional network also seems to escape the rule, but it is in fact the extension of a chain with a low degree of integration with the rest of the world. High coefficients of VA to X demonstrate local levels of production far above what one would expect for a middle-income economy with average levels of technological sophistication.
Opportunity Costs of the High Density of Brazilian Production Chains
Geographic distances from advanced economies -- reduced but not completely annulled by revolutions in transport and communications -- partially explain why Brazil's production-chain density remains well above its notional counterfactual. After all, in many branches, cross-border production chains are regional and focus on dynamic markets of high-income countries (Asia, Europe and North America).
However, the Brazilian deviation from its notional density levels also reflects trade and local-content policies, which have remained more prevalent than in most of Brazil's peer countries including China ( World Bank, 2014 ). Likewise, Brazil's precarious logistics and high transaction costs in trading across borders are incompatible with the logic of cross-border value chains.
Eliminating these factors would reduce the deviation between actual and notional densities, leading to a corresponding closure of less competitive production chain segments and a rise in import substitution. On the other hand, the businesses left standing would be more competitive and final products would have lower production costs and/or higher quality. Furthermore, in dynamic terms, such as when the adjustment implications of changing chain densities unfold, gains would increase by dint of greater technological spillovers and market extension relative to the current scenario.
The technological dynamics and cost reductions in the global economy due to the increase in value-chain fragmentation have been significant, increasing the opportunity cost of the ongoing gap between actual and notional production densities. For example, despite rising trade barriers, Mercosur's coefficient of imports from China keeps moving up. Private investors, in turn, tend to shun commitment to production lines that they see as survivors only in conditions of permanent protection.
In an economy with labor shortages and aspirations of rising worker purchasing power, productive activities would be strengthened by the availability of cheaper local consumer goods and equipment, as wage and investment costs would be lower. That would facilitate the creation of global value chains with a core in the country in natural resource-associated industries, where there clearly exists a greater scope.
Of course, public policy support remains essential. However, this support should be more horizontal in nature, rather than further encouraging the ongoing high density of production chains.

PAHRUMP, Nev. -- Whether it's hauling bikes, boats or kids -- or all of them at the same time -- Chevrolet is trying to prove that its new Colorado midsize pickup can handle them with ease.
Having already seen a successful launch of the truck, Chevy came to an empty patch of desert outside Las Vegas to show off all the ways that the truck can be loaded with accessories. Reason: Aftermarket accessories have become a big profit driver for automakers and a way to retain customers by encouraging them to make their trucks fit their own personal style.

Flipkart’s Sachin Bansal discusses internet penetration, GST & India Post with IT Minister

(Bansal visited Ravi Shankar…)
NEW DELHI: A day after Amazon India head Amit Agarwal met communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Flipkart's founder Sachin Bansal , the largest domestic ecommerce company, called on the minister to discuss greater cooperation with India Post and for the implementation of the Goods and Services tax ( GST ).
Bansal also told Prasad that a disproportionate share of Flipkart's revenue came from the top 10 cities and better logistics as well as internet connectivity would increase the share of tier II and III cities.
"I spoke to the minister for a fast nationwide roll-out of 4G for better connectivity as this would boost e-commerce in the country, especially rural India," Bansal told ET. Speaking to ET, Prasad said that on the issue of India Post, his government was willing to modernise and recast the world's largest postal network.
"I was very glad to see a young entrepreneur from this country has raised an e-commerce giant," Prasad said of Bansal, drawing similarities between him and Mark Zuckerberg , the Facebook founder whom he met last month. "Our government has been pushing the Digital India project because we believe digital connectivity will push trade and e-commerce in rural areas," Prasad said. "Flipkart has been working towards bringing small weavers from parts of this country on their online platform and I told them they must make it bigger and involve weavers from all over the country — Meerut, Tirupur and Bhagalpur," Prasad said.
As reported by ET, Amazon's Agarwal met the minister the day before and spoke of strengthening the company's ties with India Post by allowing the use of new technologies such as real-time tracking and monitoring devices to develop a delivery mechanism based on smart logistics.
India's surging online retail market is expected to touch $45 billion from about $2 billion now, driven by an increasing internet user base backed by surging smartphone sales. This has attracted significant foreign investments recently in Flipkart and Snapdeal, even as Amazon itself announced a $2 billion investment in its India operations.
Both Agarwal and Bansal have pushed for the long-delayed goods and services tax (GST) to be implemented, saying it would facilitate the growth of e-commerce in the country as it dismantles interstate barriers and creates a common market.
Flipkart has also pitched for greater cooperation with India Post, as has Amazon, which already has a tie-up with the state-run organisation. "Bansal, like Agarwal, pointed out poor logistics, multiple taxation and lack of internet connectivity as the biggest hurdles in spread of e-commerce in the country," another person aware of what took place at the meeting told ET.
According to sources, Snapdeal's co-founder Kunal Bahal is also scheduled to meet the minister next week. Snapdeal declined to comment.

Berkshire Hathaway buys P&G Co s DuracellBerkshire Hathaway to acquire Duracell battery from Procter & Gamble in $4.7 billion stock deal

("Duracell will have about…)
NEW YORK: Berkshire Hathaway agreed to buy the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble in chairman Warren Buffett's latest stock swap. Berkshire will turn over $4.7 billion of P&G shares held by Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based company, according to a Business Wire statement on Thursday.
Duracell will have about $1.7 billion in cash when the deal is completed, which is expected in the second half of next year, according to the statement. The exchange may help Berkshire cut its holding in Cincinnati-based P&G without incurring the tax costs of selling shares in the open market.
Buffett became one of P&G's biggest shareholders through an investment in Gillette. P&G bought the razor maker in 2005 in a $57-billion deal that the Berkshire chairman supported.
Berkshire held more than 100 million shares as recently as 2008 and cut the stake several times since then as the company faltered under previous CEO Bob McDonald. "I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette," Buffett said in the statement.
P&G announced last month that it would divest Duracell. CEO AG Lafley has been streamlining the company, cutting expenses and selling noncore businesses. P&G sold its pet-food business and has said it will jettison up to 100 of its slower-selling brands. Paying with shares would mirror two of Buffett's transactions in the past year, when he swapped stock that had appreciated for operating businesses.
He handed over a holding in Phillips 66 in February in exchange for its pipeline-flowimprover unit. In July, he swapped a stake in former Washington Post publisher, Graham Holdings , for cash, a Miami TV station and Berkshire stock that Graham held. Buffett had about 52 million P&G shares at the end of last year, a stake worth more than $4 billion.

Twitter Flight
Standard & Poor's assigned a junk rating to Twitter's debt on Thursday, saying the company had a "fair" risk profile.
S&P's unsolicited rating of "BB-" is three notches below investment grade. The company sold $1.8 billion worth of convertible notes in September.
S&P holds a "stable" outlook on the social media firm as it expects it "to experience very strong growth and not encounter a significant increase in competitive pressure," the ratings agency said in a note.
Twitter shares closed down nearly 5.9 percent Thursday. Twitter's 1 percent Sept. 15, 2021 convertible note was last trading at 90.4272, down 0.8 percent from Wednesday's close.
"We could raise the rating if Twitter broadens its revenue sources through international expansion and new product launches, maintains its market position, continues to improve its profitability, and achieves positive and sustained discretionary cash flow in excess of $100 million in 2016,"  the note said.
However, S&P noted that it could lower the rating if Twitter failed to achieve positive discretionary cash flow, revenue growth or if revenue actually contracts.
"This could indicate that the business model may be facing significant risks...," the statement said.
Earlier this week, the stock gained more than 7 percent after Twitter CEO Dick Costolo laid out a range of possible product changes that he said would improve the company and spur long-term growth.

Decoding India s consent to an indefinite  peace clause  | India rejoicesNovember 14, 2014, 2:25 am IST Economic Times in ET Commentary | Economy , Finance | ET
4
By Dr Biswajit Dhar
NEW DELHI: After months of impasse, India finally agreed to relent on its opposition to allow progress on the post-Bali work programme of the World Trade Organization (WTO), after concluding a “bilateral agreement” with the United States. According to the terms of the agreement, a mechanism will be in place under which WTO Members will not challenge India’s food security programmes under WTO dispute settlement procedures until a “permanent solution” regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted. In other words, India has agreed to an indefinite “peace clause”. The agreement further adds that elements for an intensified programme of work and negotiations to arrive at such a permanent solution would be set out. This deal will clear the decks for the adoption of the agreement on trade facilitation, which, as per the time-table agreed to at the end of the Bali Ministerial Conference, was to come into effect on July 31 of this year.
This “bilateral agreement” to break the logjam that the multilateral trading system has been facing for the past several months raises at least two sets of issues. First, is this manner of doing deals in conformity with the spirit of multilateralism, where decisions are to be taken collectively by countries? The agreement also points to the fact that the United States continues to have the whip hand over the WTO, which can broker critical deals without the members of the organization having participated in the process. In short, the deal may not have set the most ideal precedence for the multilateral trading system.
The second and the more important issue is the outcome of this deal for India. In the discussions on this issue thus far, India has made it clear that it was looking for a permanent solution to the problem that the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) could create for the country’s ambitious food security programme. The AoA requires that when a WTO member undertakes public stockholding for food security purposes, the difference between the prices at which the foodgrains are acquired (the minimum support price, in India’s case) and the average of the international prices prevailing during 1986-88 must be counted as subsidies. Further, this Agreement allows developing countries to grant agricultural subsidies only up to 10% of their value of agricultural production. India’s concern is that if this threshold is breached; the domestic food security programme could be in jeopardy. Since the current acquisition prices have to be set against an historical set of international prices, namely 1986-88, India, along with the G-33 countries (a group that currently has 46 countries), has argued that this inherent anomaly for the calculation of subsidies needs to be corrected, which is the essence of the “permanent solution”.
Now that the deal has been done to introduce an indefinite “peace clause”, the question that arises is whether the discussions on the permanent solution would also drag on indefinitely.
The “peace clause” does not come without conditions. The Bali Decision on public stockholding requires that countries using this facility should “have provided, and continue to provide on an annual basis … information… for each public stockholding programme that it maintains for food security purposes”. Additional information, including those related to the management of food security stocks and the number of beneficiaries would have to be provided “as soon as possible after it becomes available”. Thus, India’s food security programme would be strictly monitored by the WTO: whether this organization has the right to question the sovereign right of a country to feed its poor is therefore the moot point.

BlackBerry signs up Samsung, others, in new mobile services push
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 11.16PM IST
(BlackBerry said it would…)
SAN FRANCISCO: BlackBerry Ltd struck partnerships with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other high-profile players to enhance the capabilities of the new mobile-device management and security platform it unveiled on Thursday, and its shares jumped 8 per cent.
BlackBerry and Samsung, the world's largest mobile phone maker, will offer a "highly secure mobility solution" for Samsung's Android phones starting in early 2015. The system couples BlackBerry's enterprise platform capability with the South Korean company's own security software for its Galaxy devices.
"The partnership with Samsung is a very big deal," said John Jackson, a technology analyst at IDC. "It's hard to imagine a partnership with more significant practical impact potential."
BlackBerry said the Samsung tie-up is a long-term commitment.
"To make this Samsung partnership happen, we went to the highest levels of both companies, so this is a very serious relationship," said John Sims, BlackBerry's head of global enterprise services, calling the deal "the tip of the iceberg".
BlackBerry also touted a string of improvements to its existing products, including mobile video-conferencing via its messaging app and the ability to divide usage costs between employer and employee.
BlackBerry's Nasdaq-listed shares were up 8.7 per cent at $12.25, their highest since August 2013.
CONNECTING MACHINES
The new platform, the BlackBerry Enterprise Service, or BES12, will allow corporations and government agencies to manage and make secure not only BlackBerry's mobile devices, but also those running on operating systems such as Google Inc's
Android, Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows platform.
  For the first time, the platform will also be able to manage the use of medical diagnostic equipment, industrial machinery and motor vehicles.
BlackBerry also announced a BES12 deal with Brightstar, the world's largest wireless distribution company, and a tie-up with business software company Salesforce.com Inc that will let clients in healthcare and other regulated industries use Salesforce software to securely access data via the BlackBerry platform.
"It looks as though BES12 ticks all the boxes," IDC's Jackson said. "The challenges are it is just a phenomenally competitive environment full of very capable, very well-capitalized big guys like IBM and SAP."
The new products and services are the backbone of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen's plan to turn around the smartphone pioneer, whose devices have lost ground to Apple's iPhone, Samsung's Galaxy devices and a slew of other gadgets powered by Google's Android operating system.
While still a player in the smartphone business, BlackBerry is pivoting to focus on services and the demands of a large base of enterprise clients that are increasingly grappling with data security concerns.
The Waterloo, Ontario-based company said its customers have registered for five million BES licenses since it launched a migration push in March, with some 30 per cent of them moving from rival mobile-device management platforms.

Cabinet nod not needed for projects under Rs 1 000crorePrint
Written by Raghvendra Rao | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 3:29 am
The Narendra Modi government has decided that only schemes and projects worth over Rs 1,000 crore require the approval of the Union Cabinet or the Cabinet Committee concerned.
The decision is expected to significantly cut down the number of proposals that require Cabinet approval and lead to quicker decision-making at the ministry level. Earlier, projects worth Rs 300 crore and above required Cabinet clearance.
The government has also substantially enhanced the financial powers of ministers and secretaries when it comes to clearing public funded plan schemes and projects.
Secretaries were earlier authorised to approve projects worth less than Rs 25 crore, but have now been empowered to clear projects of up to Rs 100 crore. The secretaries, however, will have to approve these projects “in consultation with (the) Financial Advisor’’.
Similarly, ministers who were earlier authorised to approve projects ranging from Rs 25 crore to Rs 150 crore have now been allowed to clear projects from Rs 100 crore to Rs 500 crore.
The minister-in-charge and the Finance Minister have been authorised to decide on approvals for projects in the Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 bracket, except in cases where special powers have been delegated by the Finance Ministry. Earlier, only projects between Rs 150 crore to Rs 300 crore were decided by them.
The Rs 1,000 crore-plus norm will apply for all Cabinet-level clearances, except in cases “where special thresholds have been laid by the Cabinet/Committee of the Cabinet’’.
A recent example of how these new guidelines have impacted the decision-making process is a Rs 597-crore proposal to set up the National Film Heritage Mission (NFHM) that is now being cleared by the Information & Broadcasting ministry.
“A Cabinet note had been prepared for the setting up of NFHM which is aimed at preserving the country’s filmic legacy. But we were recently informed that since this project costs less than Rs 1,000 crore, it doesn’t require a Cabinet clearance,” a government source told The Indian Express.
The government has also decided that all schemes and projects which involve setting up of new companies, autonomous bodies, institutions/universities, and special purpose vehicles, etc, would be appraised by the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) chaired by Secretary (Expenditure). This appraisal would be conducted irrespective of the outlay or the nature of the ministry/department, and all such cases would need to be approved at the level of the Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee.
The Finance Ministry has also come out with a list of dos and don’ts for ministries and departments involved in appraising and approving public-funded schemes and projects. It has asked ministries to ensure that proposals considered within the delegated powers “are subjected to rigorous examination in project design and delivery”, adding that “careful attention should be paid to recurring liabilities and fund availability after adjustment of the committed liabilities”.
“Ministries should avoid the tendency to operate multiple small schemes without focus on meaningful outcomes. While considering proposals for continuation of on-going schemes, a careful rationalisation must be done through merger and dropping of continued…

US stocks close higher as Dow Jones hits record...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks wavered between small gains and losses on Thursday to close little changed as traders weighed generally strong earnings reports against the falling fortunes of energy companies.
Indexes rose from the opening of trading following encouraging quarterly results from Wal-Mart Stores and the media giant Viacom, then flitted up and down most of the day. After four weeks of healthy gains for stocks and a series of record daily closes, the tepid trading was not unexpected.
"After a move higher so far, so fast, the market needs a pause," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. "We need another catalyst to move higher."
All three major U.S. indexes closed higher after a late-afternoon rally. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.59 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,652.79, a record. It was the seventh record close for the blue-chip index in eight trading days.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.08 points, or less than a tenth of a percentage point, to 2,039.33. The Nasdaq composite rose 5.01 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,680.14.
A slump in the energy sector held back the overall market as oil prices continued to slump over fears that supplies will outstrip demand. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 4 percent and is trading at a four-year low.
Energy stocks closed down 1.4 percent. They had fallen more 2 percent, but got a boost by a late-day report from the Wall Street Journal that Halliburton is in talks to buy rival oil-field service company, Baker Hughes, citing unnamed sources. Baker Hughes soared $7.77, or 15 percent, to $58.75.
In other deal news, DreamWorks Animation jumped 14 percent on a New York Times report that the toy maker Hasbro is trying to buy the movie studio. And Berkshire Hathaway, run by billionaire Warren Buffett, said it was buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble in a deal valued at about $3 billion.
Jim Russell, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor, an investment firm, said the deal making helped keep stocks positive for the day.
"It's another source of demand for stocks, and presumably from smart buyers," he said. "It's lent some optimism to the market."
Among other stocks making big moves:
— Wal-Mart jumped $3.74 to $82.94 after reporting earnings and revenue that were higher than financial analysts had expected. The 4.7 percent gain was the biggest in the Dow.
— Viacom, which owns the Paramount studio, MTV and VH1, rose $1.95, or 2.8 percent, to $71.20 after its results topped forecasts.
— Amazon rose 1.6 percent following news that it had resolved a bitter, long-running dispute with the book publisher Hachette. Amazon stock gained $4.97 to $316.48.
Benchmark U.S. crude fell $2.97 to close at $74.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, fell $2.46 to close at $77.92 a barrel, also a 4-year low, on the ICE Futures exchange in London.
In other energy futures trading on the NYMEX:
— Wholesale gasoline fell 10.5 cents to close at $2.002 a gallon.
— Heating oil fell 8.5 cents to close at $2.362 a gallon.
— Natural gas fell 20.8 cents to close at $3.977 per 1,000 cubic feet.
In metals trading, the price of gold edged up $2.40 to $1,161.50 an ounce. Silver was flat at $15.62 an ounce and copper fell three cents to $2.99 a pound.
U.S. government bond prices rose slightly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.34 percent from 2.36 percent on Wednesday.

Cold snap helps wake up wheat and corn prices...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — Wheat prices are surging this week as temperatures plunge in the U.S. Plains states and after a government report showed domestic supplies slipped.
The price of wheat for December delivery climbed 11 cents, or 2 percent, to $5.54 on Thursday, taking its gains for the week to 7.6 percent. If the crop holds its current level it will be the biggest weekly price surge since March.
Prices started rising on Monday when a monthly report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered its estimate for domestic wheat supplies. Weather issues in Australia have also damaged the crop there.
The week's cold snap in wheat-growing states, such as North Dakota, Kansas and Nebraska, also pushed prices higher, as traders speculated that the winter wheat already planted could by damaged, said Mike Zuzolo, president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Atchison, Kansas.
The government's report "brought the weather from a back-burner issue to a front-burner issue," Zuzolo said.
The wheat market is recovering from a slump that sent prices to their lowest level in more than four years in September. Despite a rebound since the late summer, prices are still down 8 percent this year.
In the corn market, prices are also surging because of the cold weather, Zuzulo said.
The government is still forecasting a record corn crop this year, but on Monday nudged its estimates lower by 68 million bushels to 14.4 billion bushels. About 20 percent of that crop has yet to be harvested, though, in states including Illinois, Michigan and Nebraska.
While it is unlikely that the crop will be damaged by the plummeting temperatures, the snow and wintry conditions could make it difficult for farmers to gather the crop and for grain trucks to collect and distribute it.
Corn for December delivery rose 8.5 percent, or 2.3 percent, to $3.86 a bushel on Thursday. Prices are up 5 percent this week, but are down 9 percent this year.

California accuses BP of inflating gas contract... 
ELLEN KNICKMEYER | November 13, 2014 05:15 PM EST | Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — BP and its traders routinely manipulated prices to overcharge California as much as $300 million when it sold natural gas to the state, California and a fired BP employee allege in a lawsuit against the British energy company.
The BP employee, who had helped administer $2 billion in exclusive gas contracts with California, filed the case as a whistleblower, and it was kept under seal while California Attorney General Kamala Harris decided whether to join the litigation.
Harris' office notified San Francisco County Superior Court earlier this month that the state would join the case, and Judge Ernest Goldsmith made the lawsuit public in an order Wednesday.
For the past decade, California's Department of General Services entered into exclusive contracts with BP PLC to provide natural gas for state entities in hopes of locking in a reasonable and stable price, the lawsuit says. Instead, the state alleges, BP sellers routinely sold natural gas to the state at a price well above market price, and BP reaped a profit margin that typically was at least three times what was set in the contract.
Through the overcharges, BP "made more of a profit margin off California than any other customer," Niall McCarthy, a San Francisco attorney representing state agencies in the civil lawsuit, said Thursday.
BP called the allegations in the lawsuit "meritless."
"We will respond to the claims in detail through legal filings to be made at the appropriate time," the company said in an emailed statement.
The case was originally brought by Christopher Schroen, who handled the day-to-day natural gas sales to California for BP from 2004 until he was fired in 2012, when the high costs of the contract were coming under greater scrutiny, the lawsuit alleges.
Schroen alleges senior BP managers oversaw and approved the overcharges, including signing off daily on profit margins higher than those set in the contract.
In an email, David Beltran, a spokesman for the attorney general, said the state was intervening in the case "to secure accountability and protect California taxpayers."
The lawsuit states that some of the BP contracts run through 2017, and McCarthy, the private attorney, said some state bodies have renewed the contracts despite the lawsuit alleging routine overcharging.
A spokesman for California's Department of General Services said he could not immediately speak regarding the contracts or legal case.
BP shares fell 51 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $40.67 Thursday. They were down another 5 cents in afterhours trading.

100 police patrol in town with tiger on prowl...and
versions
PARIS (AP) — Scores of police patrolled a small town west of the French capital on Thursday night after a tiger eluded a massive search and remained on the prowl in the region near Disneyland Paris.
The small beast was spotted Thursday morning near a parking lot in Montevrain by a woman who snapped a photo of it.
Still on the loose by nightfall, some began to doubt whether it really was a tiger.
The Parc des Felins, a wild cat animal park 29 kilometers (18 miles) from Montevrain, said none of its cats are missing.
EuroDisney, the operator of Disneyland Paris, a top tourist destination in Europe, went out of its way to say the theme park has no tigers.
But authorities remained on alert.
Montevrain said 100 police would patrol the town of less than 10,000 overnight and the search for the animal would begin anew Friday. However, a helicopter with infrared equipment was to continue combing the area overnight, according to Cedric Tartaud, top aide to the mayor.
"We ask you for the greatest prudence," Montevrain told its residents on the town's Facebook page.
Entrances to the town's schools also were being guarded ahead of Friday classes.
Nearly 200 police, gendarmes, rescuers with tranquilizing guns and a specially trained dog searched the area Thursday. Authorities urged people in Montevrain, nearby Chessy and Chalifert to stay indoors, and children were escorted home from school.
The animal was spotted about 8:30 a.m. by the wife of supermarket manager Jean-Baptiste Berdeaux, who told BFM-TV she initially thought it was a lynx. She snapped the photo of it standing on a ridge above a parking lot.
An examination of a muddy footprint showed it was a tiger weighing about 70 kilograms (154 pounds) and about 1 ½ years old, said Clement Joly, a Montevrain spokesman.
But at nightfall, top officials were no longer using the word "tiger."
"All forces are mobilized to capture this animal," Montevrain Mayor Christiani t Robache told reporters on BFM-TV.
The under-prefect for the Seine-et-Marne region, Frederic MacKain, said the fuzzy photo "leads us to believe it's the silhouette of a feline."
The wooded region dotted with small towns provides abundant cover for any wild animal to hide.
Montevrain sent out a news alert on its Facebook page Thursday, saying a young tiger was spotted in the brush behind tennis courts and a soccer field about 9 kilometers (5 1/2 miles) from Disneyland Paris.
However, officials at the theme park, which calls itself Europe's No. 1 tourist destination, said no special precautions were taken Thursday inside the park because the loose animal wasn't deemed a threat.

Future perfect: a publicity still from 1950s' classic film 'The Forbidden Planet'. Shops are now introducing robots and technology to help buyers try fashions before they buy
Hointer, a jeans store based in Seattle that was founded by former Amazon executive Nadia Shouraboura , points to one possible future for the retail industry. Based on the idea that men do not like shopping, the store has set out to remove as much of the pain – and human interaction – from the buying process as possible.
Before visiting the store customers can download the Hointer app and decide what they would like to try on. Robots deliver the jeans directly to designated changing room, items that do not fit are returned down a chute and clothes can be purchased without leaving the cubicle simply by swiping a credit card over a card reader.

The threat from online competitors is leading more traditional retailers to consider embracing even seemingly outlandish technologies. Online growth continues to outpace traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. Where footfall in UK shops fell 0.9 per cent in September, according to the British Retail Consortium, online retailers notched up growth of 7 per cent, IMRG, the industry association for online retailers, says.
With online retailer Amazon rumoured to be planning its first physical store in New York, the threat from digital competitors is also moving off the internet and into the shopping mall or high street as well.
“High street retailers recognise they need to change,” says Peter Veash, chief executive of Bio, an agency which has helped to take retail brands such as upmarket department store Selfridges, cosmetics company Bobbi Brown and electronic retailer Dixons into the online era.
The rush to change sometimes translates into heavy spending. Worldwide, retailers are expected to spend more than $190bn on IT in 2015, according to a report by IHL, a global research company. Key areas of spending will be payment systems, data security, extending into new channels, and mobile shopping. A particular mantra being heard everywhere is “omnichannel” – by which retailers mean making shopping opportunities available in physical stores, online and on mobile devices.
So-called “beacon” technology is one of the ideas many retailers are excited about. This relatively expensive micro-location system allows stores to track shoppers’ mobile phones when they are close by and beam information and offers directly to their devices. In the UK, House of Fraser, the department store, Waitrose, the supermarket chain, and Michael Kors , a fashion house, are among those who have tested the technology, while in Sweden ICA and Coop, the grocery retailers, have also experimented with it.
A headlong adoption of technology does not always pay off, however. For example, customer opinion is still divided on self-service checkouts, one of the most visible recent technologies adopted by retailers. Twelve years after the first self-service checkout was installed in the UK, the phrase “Unexpected item in bagging area” has become a term used to describe customer frustration with the technology. A 2013 poll by Tensator, a customer management software producer, found a third of Britain’s shoppers had walked out of a store without buying the goods they intended to because of problems with self-service tills.
Some US retailers, such as wholesale warehouse club Costco and supermarket chains Jewel-Osco and Albertsons, have even removed self-service tills from stores because shoppers did not warm to them.
Mr Veash says the benefits of self-service checkouts depend on the situation. “If you are going into a luxury brand store you still want to speak to someone. But if you were going into Primark to buy one item during a busy lunchtime, you’d prefer a self-checkout.”
Geoff Brady, chairman of Harvey Jones, a maker of personalised kitchens that cost as much as a luxury cars, says that beyond using social media for some advertising, he is not in favour of any more digitisation in their showrooms.
“I think there is a lot of consumer frustration, nowadays. Some businesses don’t even display a telephone number on their websites, You can’t get in touch with them in person,” says Mr Brady, adding: “Sitting in your living room designing a kitchen on your iPad is not the same as speaking to someone.”
It may be that some of the ideas with the biggest impact could be almost invisible to customers. Clothing retailer Superdry, for example, is one of many testing to see if they can use radio frequency identification tags to track stock and to make sure that there are always plentiful supplies on the shelves.
Simple and cheap changes can also have big impact, says Jon Wragg, Superdry’s head of ecommerce. The company ran a trial where it gave shop assistants iPads equipped with chip-and-pin readers so customers could pay without having to go queue at a till. If an item was out of stock they could also order it for home delivery.
“We implemented it quite frugally – we just bought some iPad minis,” says Mr Wragg. “The payback, based on increased orders, was incredibly fast.” Superdry now plans to roll out shop-floor iPads to all stores starting in the first quarter of next year.
Payment is one area most retailers agree needs a revamp. Apple Pay , which began operating in the US in October, is the most recent and arguably most hyped of recent systems that allow shoppers to pay using mobile phones. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has said it will change the way we pay for things, and may eventually replace the wallet.
Not all retailers are fans of Apple Pay. A number of big US stores – including supermarket chains Walmart , 7-Eleven, department store group Kmart and electronics retailer Best Buy are even developing their own competitor system, CurrentC.
“I think the whole idea of payments is ripe to be revolutionised,” says Superdry’s Mr Wragg. “In the future we will be paying with wearable devices. I see a time when credit cards are a thing of the past.”

FTIL moves Bombay High Court against government order on merger with NSEL
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 09.01PM IST

Bombay high court
(Government last month ordered…)
MUMBAI: The Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL) has filed a petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the recent government order to merge its crippled National Spot Exchange with itself.
FTIL has questioned the impugned order issued by the Corporate Affairs Ministry on October 21 for proposed "forced" amalgamation of the now shut National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) with the company.
The company will take further steps as per advise of the legal counsel/lawyer, FTIL said in a communique to the BSE today.
The government had last month ordered the merger of the bourse with its parent firm, FTIL, in order to ensure faster recovery of dues for entities hit by the Rs 5600 crore fraud at NSEL.
FTIL owns 99.99 percent of NSEL, on which trading was suspended after the fraud came to light in July 2013.
Earlier, some minority shareholders of FTIL have raised objections to the proposed merger of the scam-hit NSEL with the company.
The payment crisis at NSEL came to light in July 2013 and the decision to merge it with FTIL has been taken as the bourse is not left with any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of dues, according to official sources.
The proposal of merger would take a final shape after taking into account submissions or objections made by the shareholders and creditors of the two companies. Comments have been sought from them till December 20.
NSEL's entire business, properties and liabilities, among others, would be transferred to FTIL after the merger, according to the order issued on October 21.
The ministry had said that FTIL cannot be allowed to confine its responsibility and concern only for the small investors alone and it has to shoulder full responsibility for the outstanding dues at NSEL.
FTIL has prayed in the petition that the Government order was bad in law and needs to be quashed.

Stocks that can return upto 80% in a yearDevang Mehta
("Both these companies belong…)
ET Now caught up with Devang Mehta of Anand Rathi Financial Services for his outlook on some sectors and stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: Which is the next TVS Srichakra?
Devang Mehta: Right now, probably the market is hunting for such stocks. There are a lot of such ideas. We do not know if these would emulate TVS Srichakra and become multi-baggers, but they could probably give you 50% to 80% return in a year's time.
Some stocks that immediately come to my mind are Sundram Fasteners and Igarashi Motors . Both these companies belong to the auto component or the auto ancillary universe, which has been cyclically doing very well on the back of good demand. These two, along with Kalyani Steel and others, could give you 40% to 60% type of returns .
Another stock, again from the same space, would be Atul Auto. It is into the production of three-wheelers. Their capacity is going to double in the next two to three years. It will do well.
ET Now: Anything else that is looking interesting from the small or the midcap pharma end?
Devang Mehta: One stock that we like from the pharma universe is Granules. The company's earnings growth has been triggering very well. It is in a growth phase. But it is not on the radar of most people. Granules would be one stock we would bet our money on in the midcap pharma space.
ET Now: What is the PE multiple for Granules, and what makes you bullish on Granules?
Devang Mehta: The PE multiple for it would be around 17-18 times one-year forward. But the more important thing is that the company is slowly but surely growing and it has not seen the sort of a dream run that other pharma companies have seen.
We feel there is substantial upside for them from here on. Their results have been very good, and the export demand being excellent.
ET Now: Lots of people are beginning to talk about the road sector. What is your sense on the road players? Anything interesting here?
Devang Mehta: You need to be very selective over here. The largest stock pick that would come to the mind is L&T. It is going to get the benefit of infra as well as the capital goods cycle turning. NCC is our top pick in the mid or small cap basket for infrastructure.
We do not like stocks like IVRCL for the time being. We feel there is still a lot of pain for them for another six months. But given the business model that NCC has at the current juncture, we feel it is about to be rerated. We see about 30% to 40% upside for NCC going forward.

Stocks closed slightly higher Thursday as the Dow managed to post another record closing high but the S&P 500 fell just short.
In up and down trading, stocks initially jumped on better-than-expected Walmart earnings and news of several corporate deals. But the gains were cut as plunging oil prices dragged the energy sector lower.
Oil prices fell below $75 a barrel for the first time in four years as benchmark U.S. crude dropped $2.97, or 4%, to close at $74.21 Thursday. It is down 31% since late June to its lowest level since September of 2010.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.50 points, or 0.2%, to a record close of 17,652.79 and hit a new intraday record of 17,705.48.  The Dow was led higher by Walmart (WMT ) after the nation's largest retailer reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. Walmart shares jumped 4.7% to $82.94.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index eked out a gain of 1.08 points to 2039.33, just shy of its record close of 2039.68 set Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.01 points, or 0.1%, to 4680.14.
Energy stocks taking a hit on falling oil prices: ExxonMobil (XOM) dropped 0.8% to $94.66 and Chevron (CVX) fell 1% to $116.45.
In corporate merger news:
• Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA , BRKB ) announced it is buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble (PG) in a deal valued at $4.7 billion.
• Shares of Dreamworks Animation (DWA) surged 14% to $25.52 on reports that toymaker Hasbro (HAS) was in talks to buy the film studio. Hasbro was down 4.3% to $54.98.

"There's been a lot of momentum (up) in recent weeks, and a pause is probably a healthy development," said Jim Russell, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor, an investment firm. "We can see a scenario in which the market takes a time out, and reconsolidates for few days."
Overseas, Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1.1% to close at 17,392.79, as machinery orders there rose 2.9% over the previous month, defying predictions of a decline. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.3% to 24,019.94 and the Shanghai composite fell 0.4% to 2485.61.
European benchmarks were higher, with Britain's FTSE gaining 0.4% to 6635.45, Germany's DAX climbing 0.4% to 9248.51 and France's CAC 40 up 0.2% to 4187.95.
Wednesday, markets retreated slightly as six big banks were fined $4.3 billion in a settlement over foreign exchange manipulation charges, although the Nasdaq still managed to gain 0.3%.

For Rahul to be boldPrint
The lesson to be drawn from the Youth Congress and NSUI elections is not to abandon them but to take elections to every echelon and every level of the Congress, bottom to top, including the very summit, and make transparent the process of ticket distribution.
Written by Mani Shankar Aiyar | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:05 am
Immediately after the Congress received a drubbing in the elections to the Delhi assembly in December 2013, Rahul Gandhi announced that he would be changing the Congress “in ways you cannot even imagine”.
Making that change has not proved as easy as perhaps he imagined a year ago. As against his (presumably) radical ideas, there is a conservative element in the Congress that cautions against travelling down “the road less travelled”. After all, it is the present system that pulled the party up by its bootstraps after the disastrous Sitaram Kesri interregnum. It is the same system that brought the Congress to victory in 2004. And it is the same Congress that gave us the thumping victory of 2009, when the party increased its seats from 141 to 206, a gain of 65, notwithstanding having to contend with a full term of anti-incumbency. Why change radically just because of one setback, however severe?
There is, on the other hand, the radical element that points to Rajiv Gandhi having declared at the Congress centenary in 1985, and that too in the wake of the largest election triumph the party had ever experienced, that the “brokers of power” needed to be driven out of their perches of patronage (even as Jesus had driven the money-changers out of the temple!). That observation got little traction during the remainder of Rajiv’s term but did result in the Uma Shankar Dikshit report, which laid out a roadmap for the democratisation of the party. Rajiv’s worst fears were realised when the party slid to less than half the seats it had won in 1984 in the Lok Sabha elections held five years later. Inevitably, upon moving into the opposition, his priority task was to dust off the Dikshit report. An extended meeting of the Congress Working Committee was convened on April 4, 1990, which endorsed the Dikshit committee recommendations. The recommendations were then taken to an AICC meeting held in Mavalankar Hall in mid-July 1990, where they received a thunderous welcome.
But just a fortnight later, Mandal and kamandal clashed, signalling the inevitable crumbling of the V.P. Singh government. That was followed by the short-lived Chandrashekhar interlude and we were back at elections by March 1991. Two months later, Rajiv was assassinated and his plans for party reform were put on the backburner and have not since been revived. Although, the first A.K. Antony committee (1999) added a coda to party reform continued…

No policy for northwestern frontIn Kabul, Ashraf Ghani may not follow Hamid Karzai’s policy vis-a-vis India.

Normally, celebrations are held when foreign troops leave a native soil. No Kabuliwala has, however, brought good tidings from home after most US troops have pulled out of Afghanistan. The belief in the White House and at Capitol Hill that peace would return to Afghanistan with troops returning after the 13-year war may be misplaced. The guns will not be silenced simply because American and British soldiers have withdrawn. The Taliban have not stopped killing people. They covet power in Kabul now. And then, just across the Khyber pass there is Pakistan, waiting to acquire what its policymakers describe as “strategic depth” across the western front.
Afghanistan’s future is uncertain despite the fact that there is a democratic set-up in place in Kabul and the people, particularly women, are now feeling free. Somehow, the Americans and British believe that the Ashraf Ghani-Abdullah Abdullah dispensation brokered by US Secretary of State John Kerry will provide political stability and social peace to Afghans, among whom sharp ethnic divides are notorious. The West is also optimistic that the Afghan National Army is capable of fending off Taliban groups that might try to make a bid for power in Kabul. On both counts, the US’s optimism may prove to be self-serving, meant to rationalise the withdrawal and convey to the world that this is not another Vietnam.
There are two reasons why the US had moved into Afghanistan: one, to deal a decisive blow to international terrorism after 9/11; and two, to ensure its strategic presence in the area. Both remain unaccomplished. This is because US President Barack Obama had no stomach for
wars begun by his predecessor, George W. Bush. At the onset of his presidency, Obama had asked his policy advisors to develop an exit strategy. His administration came out with a delectable coinage: that there are “good Taliban” and “bad Taliban”.
“What are the good Taliban and what are the bad Taliban?” I asked a former US ambassador I had run into. “Good Taliban are those who accept our money, the bad Taliban are those who don’t and are hardcore fellows moved only by Islamist ideology,” he said with a chuckle.
All these years, Obama’s people have been talking to the so-called good Taliban, discussing, perhaps, not money matters, but a smooth pullout of US troops. Western policy wonks who visit Delhi these days to explain the rationale of the pullout don’t hide the battle fatigue that has set in among the US and Nato after 13 years of fighting at high cost. Most Western visitors contend that they are not abandoning Afghanistan. There will be 12,000-odd US-Nato troops, plus drones for contingencies. Also, the Afghan National Army is now equipped to handle the situation. Or so the apologists for troops withdrawals say.
Just 12,000 troops — mostly observers, advisors and their attendants — can’t do the job earlier done by 2,25,000-odd continued…

Telescope: Modi on the moveThe duration of the latest trip, which began in Myanmar on Tuesday, became a matter of debate on NDTV’s Left, Right and Centre.
Written by Shailaja Bajpai | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:04 am
The prime minister of India may not go around the world in 80 days as Phileas Fogg in the Jules Verne novel did, but he will have visited more continents and countries in six months than his predecessors Manmohan Singh and Atal Bijari Vajpayee did in a year. An NDTV 24×7 map reminded us that we’ve seen him already travel to neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bhutan, and then Japan. He’s visited South America and North America. Now, he’s on a 10-day tour of Australasia. Perhaps this is what it means to acquire a global view.
The duration of the latest trip, which began in Myanmar on Tuesday, became a matter of debate on NDTV’s Left, Right and Centre: “10-Day Tour Abroad: Too Much Travel For PM Modi?” Former diplomat K.C. Singh felt the “ideal” length was five to six days. Journalist Ashok Malik agreed that “10 days is too much”, while ex-ambassador Pavan Verma said that Modi’s diplomatic “activism” in his first six months is a “little excessive”.
Former Indian cricketer Kapil Dev is not complaining. That he is travelling with the PM to Australia may have everything to do with his enthusiasm for the visit. And for Modi: “He was very pleasant then (when they met in Ahmedabad before Modi became PM); he is very pleasant now.” Dev added that the PM had done “good” for Gujarat and hoped he would do “good” for the country (NDTV 24×7). And so hope all of us.
Speaking of the excessive, the lady on DD News who tried to entertain us while we awaited the live telecast of the NDA cabinet expansion on Sunday strung together enough bling words to create an artificial atmosphere of pomp. We were at the Durbar Hall, “the heart” of Rashtrapati Bhavan that was bathed in a “lovely golden glow” on account of a “lovely two-tier chandelier”.
That left only the “lovely” people seated there for us to admire. But would the lady allow us to admire them in silence? No, she would not. Instead, she prosed on and on about “this special day”. “Today is a recognition of a lot of hard work (done by those being sworn in)… today is recognition of work at the grassroots level. (these are the people) to help India walk to a brighter future… that is the hope on this special day,” and much more tripped off her tongue. She finally stopped when the bugles announced the arrival of President Pranab Mukherjee.
Several other people on TV news could not contain themselves, either. Anchors and their studio guests on Zee News, Headlines Today, Times Now, CNN-IBN, NDTV etc, spoke during the ceremony, introducing those being sworn in. So far so good. But they also wanted to discuss the merits of the appointment immediately. Channels like News 24 went further: they spoke continued…

Americans dont think their e-mail accounts are secure. Here are four other things they think about online privacyBy Mark Berman November 13 Follow @markberman
The American public is pretty worried about their privacy. A new report issued by the Pew Research Center found a widespread feeling that privacy is essentially nonexistent , with a hefty majority of people expressing concern about the methods they use to communicate and how much of their information is being monitored and collected.
Here are five interesting numbers from this report (and Andrea Peterson has more over at The Switch about this report’s findings):
1. People do not think their e-mail is secure. 
More than half of Americans think their e-mail is “not very secure” or “not at all secure.” There’s a particular gulf here that depends on a person’s income, though; the less money a person makes, the more likely they are to feel their e-mail isn’t secure. Pew is reporting that 30 percent of people in homes earning less than $30,000 a year think e-mail is not remotely secure; just 18 percent of people in households earning $75,000 or more a year felt the same.
2. People really do not think their social media sites are secure.
Social media sites rank at the very bottom of the list of communication methods included in the Pew poll in terms of how people feel. Eight out of 10 Americans think their social media sites are not very or not at all secure.
A big part of this is fueled by older Americans, though, as more than half of people age 30 and older (57 percent) said they feel social media sites are “not at all secure.” By comparison, 37 person of people between the ages of 18 and 29, who were introduced to widespread social media usage relatively earlier in life, feel the same way.
Americans are also pretty concerned about entities — the government or businesses — accessing information they share on social media without letting them know. Eight in 10 Americans are somewhat or very concerned about businesses or advertisers looking at what they post on social media; seven in 10 Americans feel the same way about the government doing that.
3. People think their medical information and phone conversations are sensitive. Religious views or media habits? Not so much.
So let’s assume, as most Americans do, that we live in a world where your private information isn’t particularly private. What information do people actually consider particularly sensitive? What kinds of data do they care about shielding and what types of details do they consider less pivotal? Here’s a look:
It’s not such a surprise that people consider their Social Security numbers or e-mails to be sensitive. Yet in an increasingly geotagged and personalized world, it is worth noting that more people consider their physical location to be somewhat or very sensitive (82 percent of Americans) than  are concerned about the sites they have visited (70 percent) or searches they have conducted (65 percent).
Interestingly, the younger someone is, the more they feel like their habits and histories are sensitive. People between 18 and  29 were much more likely than older Americans to say their e-mails, physical locations and text messages contained very sensitive details.
Media consumption does not tend to resonate as much. Just 31 percent of people — the lowest number among the topics on Pew’s list — say their media habits are sensitive.
4. Wait, free e-mail with 15 gigabytes of storage? Here is my birthday, my search history, whatever you need.
But, and this is something key in an era where Facebook and Google own basically every bit of data about us: Americans are still willing to share personal information if it lets them use a service online at no cost. More than half of people (55 percent) said they felt this way. This number increases if look at people who use social media (60 percent) or those who use smartphones or tablets to look online (62 percent).
5. No cursing, because you are representing the company out there. 
About a quarter of Americans with jobs say their company has some sort of rules or guidelines governing how they act online. The rest of you are apparently free to do whatever you want out there.

The Right to Share (Rides  Rooms and More)Technology has enabled many Americans to become better at sharing.
The rapid growth of the collaborative, or sharing, economy is proof of this phenomenon.
Jeremiah Owyang, founder of sharing-economy analytics firm Crowd Companies, defines the sharing economy as "a powerful movement ... [enabling] peer-to-peer sharing of goods, services, transportation, space and money at a speed and scale that were unimaginable a decade ago."
In the sharing economy:
You can pay someone to stay the night in his or her guest room. (Airbnb)
You can pay a stranger to borrow his or her car. (Relay Rides)
Better yet, you can pay a stranger to give you a ride. (SideCar, Lyft, Uber)
Widely accessible smartphone technology takes a car or house and potentially doubles its value by turning that property into a revenue stream. Conversely, consumers using ridesharing or Airbnb pay less because rideshare drivers and roomsharing participants face minimal overhead costs.
The benefits of the sharing economy are numerous, but they stem from the fact that these business models have evolved past a traditional middleman, meaning services and goods cost less for consumers, and providers can keep more profits. In " Sharing is the new buying ," released in spring 2014, Owyang reported that approximately 80 million Americans are already "sharing," and estimated that the number of those using emergent sharing services like Uber and Airbnb could double within a year.
But many people with vested interests in the way things have always been done work actively to crush new models to protect existing businesses.
Take Chicago's taxi system.
Chicago's system revolves around the "medallion," a permit issued by the city that a driver must own or lease to operate a cab. Problem is, only a handful of people in the city can afford to become medallion owners -- in September 2013, the city of Chicago hosted an auction for 50 medallions and started the bidding at $360,000 a piece. The city keeps making money off of medallions even after they're sold -- Chicago gets a 5-20 percent cut each time a medallion is sold privately (that takeaway would range from $17,500-$70,000 on a $350,000 medallion).
Because the system is so prohibitively expensive, University of Illinois at Chicago researchers estimated that only a quarter of taxi drivers in Chicago owned medallions. The rest of the drivers pay an average of about $500 per week to lease the right to operate taxis using the remaining medallions.
So it's not surprising that the people benefiting from this setup aren't fond of UberX, through which drivers can bypass the medallion system entirely.
The sharing economy is disruptive, and that's a good thing.
But the city and medallion stakeholders have a lot to lose -- in fact, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have attacked the ridesharing model.
Fortunately, a drastic city ordinance proposed in February was scaled back. Unfortunately, under the city's new rules, if a driver works more than 20 hours a week, they have to pay to get a chauffeur's license. Uber drivers also cannot pick up passengers at the Midway or O'Hare airports, or at McCormick Place, though the city ordinance gives the Commissioner of the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection the authority to allow pickups from these locations if he or she deems it can be safely done.
The state tried to pass an even more severe law , which would have set an 18-hour weekly limit on drivers who want to avoid additional steep regulations that would be enacted throughout the entire state. Though it passed in the House and Senate, Gov. Pat Quinn vetoed the bill in August.
Uber isn't the only sharing mechanism that has come under attack. San Francisco finally legalized Airbnb this fall (though new rules won't take effect until Feb. 1, 2015) -- but at a price . Users can only offer short-term rentals (less than 30 days) if they are permanent residents of San Francisco, meaning they occupy their San Francisco property for at least 60 consecutive days with the intent to make it their primary place of residence. Prospective roomsharers must also register as "hosts" with the city. New York City is also in the process of determining how it will regulate roomsharing services like Airbnb.
Government shouldn't get in the way of the collaborative economy, and politicians, bureaucrats and the politically connected shouldn't try to stifle those who are making a living through innovative platforms such as Uber and Airbnb.

How Protectionism Can Save Myanmarreddit
YANGON, Myanmar -- Walk through the aisles of City Mart in downtown Yangon's FMI Centre and you will find a selection of products that any supermarket in Hong Kong or Singapore would be proud of. The shelves are packed with imported global brands -- from Cadbury to Coca Cola, Nestlé to Nissin. Not what you might expect in a country that until recently was off limits to most multinationals due to economic sanctions imposed by the West.
The view from the top floor inside one of downtown Yangon's few high-rise office towers
Nestlé, taking advantage of Myanmar's "opening up," recently committed $50 million to the country's food and beverage industry over the next six years. With similar announcements an almost daily occurrence, the Burmese government should consider what measures can be taken to ensure local business is able to compete with foreign firms and isn't left in the dust. In short, these investments should come with some strings attached. The government should be able to consider such measures without coming under fire from western interests whose own countries have many policies in place that favor domestic industry, usually at the expense of competitors in developing economies.
The easing of sanctions on Myanmar in 2012 has led to trade liberalization which is being lauded at every turn by foreign leaders and CEOs who view the Burmese population of roughly 50 million , the vast majority of whom are yet to enter the consuming classes, as a potential gold mine. But there is a darker side to this trend -- Myanmar's agricultural producers now face the same threat to their livelihoods as millions of farmers and domestic businesses throughout the developing world.
The selection of milk products available at City Mart is indicative of this threat; the shelves are dominated by imports from neighboring Thailand and Malaysia and as far afield as Australia, New Zealand and U.S. locally produced fresh milk and yogurt make up just a tiny fraction of the goods on offer.
The local milk and dairy products on offer at outdoor markets in Yangon
Milk production in Myanmar more than doubled in the decade leading up to 2011, and domestic consumption of dairy products is steadily increasing. Despite the rise in production, the yield per cow remains significantly lower than in more developed economies and maintaining the quality of fresh milk along the supply chain is a major challenge. There are no national quality standards in place for raw milk, and the bacteria counts in milk at local collection centers is alarmingly high which is why a large portion of raw Burmese milk is processed into condensed milk, a staple at the country's ubiquitous tea shops. Even if quality can be improved through training and the application of appropriate technology and processes, a lack of rural transport and electricity infrastructure makes it almost impossible to store and transport milk at the low temperature required to prevent spoilage.
Buyers use crude techniques to test the protein content of raw milk delivered by smallholder farmers
These factors undermine the domestic dairy industry's ability to compete with underpriced and often heavily subsidized imports. OECD member states collectively provided over $50 billion in direct subsidies for animal products and feed in 2012. New Zealand, which scrapped most farm subsidies in the mid-1980s, is an exception to this rule but even Kiwi dairy farmers and processors enjoy the benefits of underpriced inputs such as water and fossil fuels and are able to externalize the cost of environmental pollution. Many in New Zealand, home to the world's largest dairy exporter, Fonterra, are today questioning whether dairy farming is the prime cause of increased pollution in the country's waterways. This is not to mention the externalities arising from the industry due to its greenhouse gas emissions.
Recent and reliable statistics are hard to come by in Myanmar but some estimate that food imports increased 40 percent per annum between 2005 and 2011, and since sanctions were lifted that figure is likely to have increased. Domestic dairy producers are not the only ones feeling the squeeze.
Burmese poultry farmers and processors are deeply concerned about the impact on their livelihoods of foreign firms leveraging economies of scale and, you guessed it, subsidies, to import chicken wholesale for as little as one twentieth the current retail market prices. The chair of the Mandalay Region Poultry and Egg Production and Trading Association, U Kyaw Htin, told The Myanmar Times : "We can't rely only on trading for our country, we need manufacturing. Our country can't manufacture cars or airplanes, but we can do poultry very well and improve it step-by-step." Htin is one of many Burmese who, in contrast to the mantra of trade liberalization, believes the government needs to do more to support domestic industries as it struggles to compete against more developed foreign firms with easy access to financing and which enjoy subsidies provided by their own states.
Htin is not the only one who thinks the government should do more to foster the development and competitiveness of local agribusinesses. There is a growing view, particularly among Asia's developing economies, that the liberalization of trade in the agricultural sector is threatening food security, undermining the fight to alleviate poverty and having a negative impact on the livelihoods of rural farming communities. Nowhere is this view more strongly held than in India where successive governments have blocked a number of the WTOs proposed agricultural trade agreements on the grounds that they unfairly favor heavily subsidized western interests and would threaten the ability of hundreds of millions of Indian farmers to earn a living.
Small business owners like these dairy farmers north of Yangon will struggle to compete with foreign competition
So what can be done to support Myanmar's dairy industry and its agricultural sector at large, which today employs over half the workforce and in 2012  accounted for over one third of GDP? If solutions are left to the "invisible hand," the market will continue to be flooded with cheap, underpriced imports and local players will not have the opportunity to compete on a level playing field. It is the role of the state to set the rules of the game played by the private sector and there are many measures the Burmese government could take -- some of which are already underway.
Firstly the government should provide more incentives for domestic small and medium-sized businesses to invest in appropriate technology and encourage local banks to provide access to the capital required to do so by allowing them to lend against cash flow, livestock and produce as collateral. Enhancing property rights for farmers will also go some way towards achieving this as it will provide the collateral needed for loans and the sense of security required for farmers to consider making investments in their future.
Secondly, public investments in urbanization, touted by many as the fast train to prosperity, should not be made at the expense of rural development. Myanmar needs to make significant investments in its rural transport and energy infrastructure if domestic players are to compete with foreign firms.
If investments are to be made in rural infrastructure, the money has to come from somewhere. Having cleared about 60 percent of its total sovereign debt, the government should come up with smart ways to offset the cost of these investments rather than rack up new debt or rely on fickle development aid with strings attached.
They could, for example, mandate that foreign firms that want to establish operations in-country or import products must contribute to a rural development fund. Would it be unfair to ask foreign firms trying to capture a portion of Myanmar's sizable market to pay a small premium? To put things into context, in 2013 the Burmese government's total tax revenues of around $16 billion were approximately equal to the operating cash flow of Nestlé .
It is all too easy for businesspeople and politicians from western economies to criticize developing countries for taking measures to protect domestic economic interests, but critics in glass houses should not throw stones. Most western nations, including the two great bastions of free trade the U.S. and U.K., adopted extremely protectionist policies during earlier stages of development. Today western governments lead the pack when it comes to protectionism by collectively offering many hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to enable local industry to better compete at home and abroad.
American public and private sector leaders in particular should contemplate the words of the 25th president, William McKinley, who, in 1892 when the U.S. was still one of the most protectionist countries in the world, said: "Under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man."

If inflation rises, 2015 rate hike possible: Fed's Kocherlakota
Reuters Nov 14, 2014, 02.26AM IST
(A top US central banker who…)
PALO ALTO, California: A top US central banker who has consistently pushed for easier monetary policy suggested on Thursday that he could support an interest rate hike next year if he starts to see inflation rising faster than he now expects.
In remarks prepared for delivery to a symposium at Stanford University, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota reiterated his view that inflation will not rise back to the Fed's 2 percent goal until 2018, making a rate hike next year "inappropriate."
But for the first time in recent speeches, Kocherlakota nodded explicitly to the possibility of a rate hike next year, the timing anticipated by all but one of his colleagues at the Fed.
"My inflation outlook could rise," Kocherlakota said, emphasizing that his views are driven by data. "If so, my preferred date of interest rate 'lift-off' would come forward in time - possibly into next year."
For the last two years, Kocherlakota has been one of the Fed's most dovish policymakers, pushing for easier policy even as many of his colleagues are acknowledging the likely need to tighten monetary policy sometime in the next 12 months or so.
Kocherlakota cast the lone dissent at the Fed's policy-setting meeting last month, saying that low inflation and signs that inflation expectations are falling should prompt the Fed to continue its monetary stimulus.
Instead, citing diminishing slack in the labor market, the central bank completed the wind-down of its bond-buying program. That step was seen as paving the way for what many economists believe will be the start of a round of rate hikes next June. The Fed has kept rates near zero since December 2008.
Kocherlakota, for his part, said on Thursday that a falling unemployment rate alone should not prompt a rate hike unless it leads to unduly high inflationary pressures.
"Despite recent and anticipated falls in the unemployment rate, I don't see such pressures at this time," he said.

Drugs & targets: 14 deaths later  the buck passing begins  probeonR K Gupta, the doctor who did the surgeries, has been arrested. (Source: Reuters)
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur | Posted: November 14, 2014 3:39 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 8:38 am
Five days and 14 deaths later, as the Chhattisgarh government cracked down on drug manufactures who supplied “medicines of suspicious quality” for the laparoscopic tubectomies in Bilaspur, the blame game has begun in the health department, with officials giving different accounts on the use and purchase of these medicines.
Meanwhile, the state government on Thursday dismissed Dr R K Gupta, who conducted the operations and was arrested late on Wednesday night, and Bilaspur CMO R K Bhange. On January 26 this year, it had awarded Dr Gupta for carrying out a record 50,000 tubectomies .
The government also ordered a judicial probe into the deaths. Under the guidelines , a doctor cannot conduct more than 10 such surgeries in a day. Gupta did 83 tubectomies in just five hours at the Takhatpur camp in Bilaspur on Saturday.
The government on Wednesday banned four drugs — an antiseptic lotion, anesthetic injection Lidocaine Hydrochloride, tablets Ibuprofen and Ciprofloxacin. While it is yet to be established that these medicines caused the deaths, it has emerged that they were manufactured by small-scale producers, not reputed pharma companies. The department headed by Health Minister Amar Agarwal was responsible for the purchase of the medicines.
A day after the ban, the Food and Drug Controller on Thursday raided a manufacturer, Mahawar Pharma Pvt Ltd. The company has a small factory in a residential colony of Raipur, which does not even have a notice board giving its name or its operations. It produced Ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic given after the surgeries.
Both Gupta and Bhange accused the government of shielding those who are actually guilty. “I have not done anything wrong. We were supplied spurious medicines. The Health Minister is responsible. I am being made the scapegoat,” said Gupta, who is in judicial custody.
“Ciprofloxacin seized from the spot had October 2014 manufacturing date, whereas the ones I purchased are of September 2014. I don’t know how the other medicine reached the camp. I didn’t purchase it,” said Bhange.
The health department is supposed to purchase medicines after inviting tenders and examining the drugs. In urgent cases, the CMO also has a reserved quota to purchase from the open market.
The manufacturers put the onus on the government.
“We never sell directly to the government. We sell in the open market to drug traders, who later supply it to various agencies. This antibiotic is sold at many places and consumed by people. We have never received any complaint. How is it that it showed these results only at the government camp?” said Mahavar Pharma Pvt Ltd in a statement.

US Lawmakers move to strip former Nazis ofbenefitsIn this undated file photo, a machine gun is seen over the parade ground at the Sachsenhausen Nazi concentration camp.
By: Associated Press | Washington | Posted: November 14, 2014 3:37 am
A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation Thursday to strip suspected Nazi war criminals of their US government pension benefits, insisting American taxpayers should not be underwriting the retirement of anyone who participated in the Third Reich’s atrocities.
The Nazi Social Security Benefits Termination Act comes in response to an Associated Press investigation published in October that revealed millions of dollars in benefits have been paid to dozens of former Nazis who were forced out of the United States. At least four are alive, living in Europe on the benefits, called  Social Security.
The legislation would end benefits for Nazi suspects who have lost their American citizenship, a step called denaturalization. US law currently requires a higher threshold – a final order of deportation – before benefits can be terminated. A companion bill to close this so-called loophole is scheduled to be introduced in the Senate.
Mike Long, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said “we’re eager to get this done” during the current session that will last until a new Congress begins in late January.
AP’s investigation found that the Justice Department used the loophole to persuade Nazi suspects to leave the US in exchange for Social Security benefits. If they agreed to go voluntarily, or simply fled the country before being deported, they could keep their Social Security benefits. The Justice Department denied using Social Security payments as a tool for expelling former Nazis.
“Our bill will eliminate the loophole that has allowed Nazi war criminals to collect Social Security benefits,” Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the bill’s main sponsor, said in a statement. “We should work in a bipartisan and expeditious manner to terminate these benefits once and for all.”
The White House and US Social Security Administration have signaled support for denying benefits to former Nazis. The Justice Department said it is open to considering proposals that would terminate the Social Security payments.
“This legislation is long overdue, and we are pleased that lawmakers in Congress are taking this seriously,” said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League.
The legislation specifically targets individuals who were denaturalized because of their roles in the Nazi persecution or lost their citizenship through a settlement agreement with the Justice Department. The bill requires the Justice Department to notify the Social Security Administration of their identities and locations so the agency can shut off their benefits.
The Justice Department and Social Security Administration also would be required to submit a report to Congress six months after the bill’s enactment identifying the total number of individuals found to be participants in the Nazi persecution and the total number of individuals whose benefits were effectively revoked.
The Social Security Administration has refused the AP’s request for the overall number of Nazi continued…

Commitments made to reduce Jerusalem tensions:USIsrael and Jordan have committed to a series of "specific and practical" steps to reduce tensions, said John Kerry.
By: Associated Press | Amman | Posted: November 14, 2014 4:00 am
Israel and Jordan have committed to a series of “specific and practical” steps to reduce spiraling tensions over Jerusalem holy sites and the Palestinians have pledged to curb incitement and violence, US Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday.
However, he refused to describe what measures were agreed to and Jordan, which recalled its ambassador to Israel last week to protest an Israeli crackdown on protesters at the al-Aqsa mosque, said pointedly it was not yet ready to return the envoy. Perhaps more telling, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas did not attend a meeting among Kerry, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan’s King Abdullah II. Kerry said it was “not the right moment” for Abbas and Netanyahu to meet.
While insisting that the steps to be taken must be kept secret to avoid misunderstandings, Kerry said they would become evident in the coming days if all sides keep to their word.
After the nearly three-hour Kerry-Netanyahu-Abdullah session , which followed separate talks between Kerry and Abbas, the top US diplomat praised all three leaders for their willingness to restore calm amid deteriorating conditions on the ground and increasingly acrimonious complaints between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Netanyahu has accused Abbas of intentionally aggravating the situation and encouraging Palestinian attacks against Israelis, while Abbas has accused Netanyahu’s government of trying to provoke a religious war.
Kerry said he and Abbas discussed “constructive steps, real steps, not rhetoric, but real steps people can take to de-escalate the situation” and that the Palestinian leader “strongly expressed his firm commitment to non-violence and that he will do everything possible to stop violence and change the climate.”
Meanwhile, he said Netanyahu and King Abdullah, who serves as custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, had agreed on a series of measures that would “instill confidence” among all the parties.
“We are not going to lay out each practical step,” Kerry told reporters at a news conference with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. “The important thing is that they are done. Not all of it can happen overnight. Not every message will reach every person immediately, but the leadership is committed.”
At the same time, he said nothing is guaranteed.
“Actions are what matter, not just words. I heard words, they were expressed sincerely,” he said, stressing that actions were needed. “We will see in the days to come.”
US officials had hoped to get some indication from Jordan that it was ready to consider returning its ambassador to Israel, but Judeh made clear this would depend on what Israel does.
“Recalling our ambassador for consultation was a very clear signal that something has to be done to check these actions that are causing great concern,” he said. “With intensively diplomacy we have seen a commitment on continued…

We had lost hope of getting justice  now punishothersRiyaz Ahmad’s family at their home in Nadihal. (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)

A father, a wife, a mother, a brother — for them, the Machil encounter is far more than a Twitter hashtag, those killings marked the end of their own lives as they knew it.
When news reached them of the court martial recommendation, four years after Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Riyaz Ahmad Lone and Mohammad Shafi Lone were killed, their families in Sopore’s Nadihal village couldn’t believe for a while that justice had finally been delivered.
And now that it has happened, at least in the case of the Army men, they want the civilians who lured the three away from the village to be punished too.
“We had lost hope of justice from the Army, but it is good news that the culprits have finally been punished,’’ Mohammad Yosuf, father of Shahzad, told The Indian Express.
“My son, who was working at a workshop, was innocent. Along with his two neighbours, he was killed in cold blood. It is good that the Army has punished its men,’’ the 65 year old said.
“I travelled to Kupwara five times and appeared before the court martial in the hope that I would get justice one day. Although the officials respected us, I had my doubts about whether they would punish their men and officers involved in the crime,’’ he said.
Yosuf, however, added that justice will be done only when the two civilians – Bashir Ahmad Lone and Abdul Hamid – who had handed over the three youngsters to the soldiers get life sentences. “They (Bashir and Hamid) are still trying to save themselves as their trial is going on in the civil court,’’ he said. “I will be relieved only when those two are awarded death sentences.’’
Shahzad’s wife Jabeen Akthar said that after her husband’s death she had only one aim – to get the guilty soldiers and civilians punished.
“I have to take care of my eight year old son and need a lot of money to run the family, but I am still pursuing the case along with my family members,” she said. “We spent a lot of money on this case and justice will be done when this verdict will actually be implemented.”
A little distance away, the family of Riyaz Ahmad Lone lives in a single storey house. “I pray to the almighty that these men who killed innocent souls rot in jails forever,’’ said Riyaz’s mother Haleema. “Real justice would have been to hang the killers of our children.’’
The family members of Mohammad Shafi Lone said that the civilians involved in this case should also get harsh punishment.
“This decision has come late, but if it is implemented it will restore the image of the Army,” said Showket Ahmad, brother of Mohammad.
Ahmad also alleged that the relatives of the two civilians who handed over his brother and the two others to the soldiers were threatening them.
“Even during the court proceedings at continued…

University industry interaction can spur entrepreneurship

(“Developing drones was…)
BENGALURU: Rohan Verma was still a student when he bagged his first customer while showcasing at a fest at Goa's BITS Pilani the unmanned aerial vehicle or drone that he had built on campus. Verma founded the start-up Blackprop Tree in Gurgaon soon thereafter and three years on the 22-year-old is among the prime examples of how university industry interaction can spur entrepreneurship.
"Developing drones was just pure passion. Entrepreneurship was an accident," said Verma, whose company has recorded sales of 3 lakh and is looking to tap large companies such as Indian Oil Corporation and GAIL .
Although college projects in India have not traditionally been designed to solve real-world problems, industry and academia are now getting together, owing to the necessity of drones in everyday life and the nascency of the technology. Anna University, SRM University and Delhi Technological University are some of the institutions providing the requisite resources to students to equip them to be on top of the game, leading to synergies with the industry.
"It's a technology that touches both the military and civilian life at the same time. That's why we see industries actively seeking out institutions like ours," said Professor SN Omkar, chief research scientist at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, which is working with St John's Research Institute to identify the source of toxic particulate matter in air through drones. Inside the campus of Delhi Technological University is a thriving student run lab, backed by Lockheed Martin, which works on sophisticated drones way past its regular hours.

Venture capitalists buy Ello's vision of public benefit

BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Paul Budnitz takes his iPhone out of his pocket and places it on the small, round table in his new office on Pine Street in Burlington.
"There it is," he says. "That's what we're building. To me this is totally transparent. We're making an app store."
The "app store" Budnitz is referring to is Ello, the wildly popular website he launched in August based on his latest crazy idea: an ad-free social network where user data is not for sale, and users can remain anonymous. How anonymous? A pony has been posting on the website since the beginning, Budnitz says, giving daily updates on her life.
Ello's claims that it would remain ad-free were greeted with skepticism among tech bloggers and journalists. As Wired magazine noted, "Critics have warned that, despite Ello's ad-free manifesto, the company might be pressured to sell out by investors looking for a return on their money."
My short, uneventful flirtation with Ello: Jon Swartz
In response, Budnitz raised an additional $5.5 million in venture capital, while simultaneously turning Ello, which is registered in Delaware, into a public benefit corporation.
"We're a for-profit company that has a mission, and its mission is taken into account with the same level of importance as profitability," Budnitz says. "So basically it allows us to make choices based on our charter and mission, even if those choices might not always be the most profitable choices."
What is that mission? Lee Bouyea, managing director of FreshTracks Capital in Shelburne, which made an initial $435,00 investment in Ello, says Budnitz made it clear when pitching FreshTracks.
"Paul came to us over a year ago and said, 'I want to build an ad-free social network,' and he's never wavered from that vision, and we bought into that vision when we funded this back in January," Bouyea says. "The press has intensified that issue, but from our standpoint we never strayed from that initial mission."
Profit through apps
Budnitz uses the iPhone to explain his business plan because that plan has already succeeded magnificently on the Apple device. Like iPhone users, Budnitz says Ello users will be able to customize their sites with low-cost apps, which will make Ello profitable while the site remains free, and free of advertisements.

While the Ello apps are still under development — the website is still in beta testing — Budnitz gave an example of what one might be: the ability to control multiple Ello accounts from a single log-in.
"That's something we're likely to charge a dollar for," Budnitz says. "It's a convenience, something not everyone needs."
Budnitz also has a business making titanium, belt-driven city bicycles he says parallels what he will do with Ello, in that each bike is custom-built for the buyer. Budnitz bikes are averaging about $7,000 each, sold to customers around the world. Both businesses are based in Budnitz's airy, upstairs space on Pine Street.
Ello social site too popular, gets online attack
Budnitz calls his bike company "another stupid idea that's working."
"It is actually my motto," he says. "If you're doing something so stupid no one else would do it, you know you have a market because you have no competition."
Cool guys
Ello's launch had tech bloggers and writers hyperventilating from coast to coast. They quickly pitted Ello against Facebook, dubbing it the "Facebook slayer." And indeed, Ello inspired a frenzy of prospective subscribers to its invitation-only website. Invitations are being sold on eBay.
Budnitz declined in an interview with the Burlington Free Press to say how many subscribers Ello has, but was cited in the Wired story that ran at the end of October saying the site has accumulated more than 1 million "members" since its launch in August, with another 3 million waiting in the "queue."

An Ello spokeswoman denied Budnitz gave those numbers to Wired, but the website's surge has gotten Facebook's attention, according to Cairn Cross, co-founder of FreshTracks Capital.
It was the FreshTracks investment that really wound up industry observers (read Silicon Valley) accustomed to exit strategies and huge paydays. Those folks simply refused to believe that Ello could remain ad-free while also satisfying the demands that taking VC money entails.
FreshTracks and other investors participated in the latest $5.5 million round of investment in Ello, but the biggest investor is Foundry Group, a venture capital firm in Boulder, Colo., that focuses on early-stage IT companies. Budnitz has known the principals at Foundry for at least seven years, he says, having lived in Boulder himself for a while.
"They're just cool guys," he says. "Not your typical venture capitalists."
Budnitz says he was offered a great deal more money than he took from Foundry Group and the other investors — by people he didn't know who filled his inbox with propositions. He wasn't about to take any of those offers, he says, because of where it could have led.
"I could end up sitting in a room with people who are essentially my partners who don't share my vision and who gave us so much money that we're under pressure to do things we don't want to do," Budnitz says.
Beautiful things
The Foundry Group made it clear on its blog that it's on board with Ello's mission, saying, "We're strong supporters of the Ello team's unique vision for the business. ...It's important that we state this clearly, since there are bound to be people who view this financing with skepticism. Foundry Group is completely supportive of the Ello mission. We'll either build a business that doesn't rely on third party advertising or the selling of user data or we won't build a business."
Seth Levine, a managing director of Foundry Group and author of the blog post, goes on to express his confidence in Ello's business model.

"Our belief is that there are products and features that Ello can develop that users will be willing to pay for," Levine writes. "While the price points may be low, as part of a much larger ecosystem with millions of users, will provide an economic model for the company which supports the business and our investment."
And just in case anyone still doesn't get the point, the founders and investors in Ello signed and posted an open letter on the website, dated Oct. 20, titled, "A Better Way."
"Ello's explosive growth over the last few months proves that there is a hunger to connect with friends and see beautiful things — without being manipulated by ad salesmen, boosted posts, and computer algorithms that don't always have our best interests at heart," the letter states. "On an ad-driven social network, the advertiser is the customer and you're the product that's bought and sold."
The letter goes on to say that if Ello is ever sold, the buyer will be required to adhere to the same requirements, thanks to its status as a public benefit corporation.
"In other words, Ello exists for your benefit, not just to make money," the letter summarizes.
Leaping over
Budnitz is first and foremost a designer, which is evident on the Ello website, with its distinctive black smiley face, and sea of Ello users, mostly depicted by their photos, floating in round windows.
"You can't make anything new by doing what's been done before," Budnitz says. "You have to leap over. That's what innovation is."
Budnitz admits to not being an "administrator." He manages the vision and direction of his companies, not the day-to-day details. Ello began as a vision shared with about 100 of his friends in a private social network. Budnitz bicycles began as his personal search for the bike he wanted, but could not get. Even now, Budnitz has another vision kicking around in his head.
"Here's one, you ready?" he says. "Any website where you're searching for something and they give you 4 million possible results, it's broken. There's a better way to do it, but I'm not going to tell you what it is."

Report: Halliburton in talks to buy Baker Hughes...and
versions
HOUSTON (AP) — Oilfield-services provider Baker Hughes Inc. says it is talks with rival Halliburton Co. about a potential merger.
The company's brief statement late Thursday said there was no guarantee that a deal would be done and offered no further details.
It came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Halliburton was in talks to buy Baker Hughes. At the start of trading Thursday, Baker Hughes' stock market value was $22 billion.
Representatives from Halliburton declined to comment. Both companies are based in Houston.
The deal talk comes during a drop in oil prices that has hurt both companies' stock price.
Halliburton, Baker Hughes and a third major competitor, Schlumberger Ltd., help energy companies find and extract oil and gas.

Gold deposit scheme re-launch can cut importsgold and precious material
Gold and silver refiner MMTC Pamp has proposed a minimum gold deposit of 40 grams after carrying out a survey of 5,000 households
Gold imports can come down by 250 tonnes a year if the government re-launches the gold deposit scheme and mobilises at least one per cent of the estimated 25,000-tonne of idle gold stock lying with Indians, according to gold and silver refiner MMTC Pamp.
The current gold deposit scheme, launched in 1999, is beyond the reach of most households as it mandates a minimum deposit of 500g. Only temples and trusts are taking advantage of this scheme and not the general householders.
“There is a need to re-launch the gold deposit scheme with a minimum 40g of gold deposits. Even if we mobilise one per cent of the estimated 25,000 tonnes of idle gold stock, we will be able reduce imports by 250 tonnes a year,” MMTC Pamp Managing Director Rajesh Khosla said.
The company has proposed a minimum gold deposit of 40 grams after carrying out a survey of 5,000 households across the country. “The Reserve Bank of India has said that the proposal looks alright and we are now waiting for a notification,” he said.
Stating that India’s gold demand is unlikely to come down even if the government further tightens import norms, Mr. Khosla said. “The only way is to get the idle gold in circulation through a gold deposit scheme tailored specially for general households and not for banks and large gold holders.”
The proposed scheme would help in balancing the huge gap between demand and supply and bring down the current account deficit (CAD), he added.
If the proposed scheme took off, Mr. Khosla said the company would act as an enabler in the gold deposit scheme since it was the only refinery to be accredited with the London Bullion Markets Association.
MMTC Pamp, a joint venture between state-run MMTC and Switzerland’s PAMP, said under the proposed scheme, it would collect, assay, transport, refine and re-transport gold as instructed by banks.
India, the world’s largest gold consumer, imports 800-900 tonnes of the yellow metal every year. The country is estimated to have imported 410 tonnes in the first half of this fiscal.

Here's a look at some of the iconic brands of Mondelez, the Deerfield company created through a spin-off of Kraft Foods snack brands. The name comes from the French words for "world" and "delicious."
Chairman and CEO Irene Rosenfeld called the operating environment "challenging" and said Mondelez is focused on cutting costs and improving its productivity in order to boost profit. The company expects demand from retailers and consumers to remain "soft" in the near term, she said.
The company is not counting on its categories recovering in order to meet the expectations it lays out for Wall Street, Rosenfeld said.

Govt plans new policy to boost household savingsGovt plans new policy to boost household savings
Mahua Venkatesh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 12, 2014

The government is mulling a comprehensive plan to encourage financial savings and boost money parked in a slew of products including bank fixed deposits, insurance premium, mutual funds and post-office savings.
While the government is set to relaunch the Kisan Vikas Patra in the next few weeks, it would also come up with two more such instruments, one aimed at the girl child and the other at the country’s youth.
“We would be coming out with a comprehensive policy on boosting savings in which all the channels like banks, post offices and even insurance firms would be used to boost savings in a co-ordinated way…we have been holding talks on the same,” a senior finance ministry official, who did not wish to be identified, told HT.
Total household savings in India at the end of 2012-13 — the latest for which data is available — stood at Rs. 24.72 lakh crore.
Two-thirds of these savings (66% or about Rs. 16.01 lakh crore), however, were in physical assets such as gold and real estate, with the remaining ( 34% or about Rs. 8.06 lakh crore) in financial savings such as bank deposits, mutual funds and company shares and debentures.
India’s savings rate, which had peaked at 38.1% of GDP in 2008, fell to 30.1% of GDP in 2012-13.
Frugal households could well turn out to be the primary financiers of mammoth infrastructure projects. India’s savings rate could reach 40% of GDP in the next few years and can potentially be sustained at high levels for well over a decade, primarily due to its armies of young people entering the workforce.
“It should be the endeavour of all the agencies engaged in mobilisation of savings to ensure that the savings movement is taken to the farthest corners of our country,” finance minister Arun Jaitley said at a recent function.
For Indians, gold, for long has been a tested hedge against inflation and has been a traditional favourite for parking surplus income as it has long been considered a safe haven asset.
In August, the government launched an ambitious scheme  — the Pradhan Mantri’s Jan Dhan Yojana — to provide bank accounts to 75 million people by January.
According to the World Bank’s Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex), only 26% of women in India admit to having a bank account. More than four out of ten adults  in India still do not have a bank account.
In the last budget, the finance minister had raised tax exemption limits on a range of instruments popularly known as the ‘Section 80 scheme’ from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 1.5 lakh per annum.

General Motors to shed over 500 jobs in USGeneral Motors to shed over 500 jobs in US

General Motors, under investigation because of defective ignition switches linked to at least 32 deaths, is to cut more than 500 jobs at two plants in the United States.
Approximately 160 employees will be laid off during 2015 at a factory in Orion, Michigan to "better align with market demand," the company said in an email to AFP, and a plant in Lansing, in the same state, will eliminate 350 of its 1,500 positions for the same reason.
"GM is committed to a strong and lasting presence in Lansing," a spokesperson said, adding that the US auto giant had pledged $281.5 million in investment for Lansing-based facilities since 2013.
General Motors last month reported lower third-quarter earnings on weakness in some international markets.
GM is under investigation by Congress, regulators and the US Justice Department over why it waited more than a decade after first uncovering the ignition-switch problem to start recalling cars.

Brent at 4-year low: petrol  diesel prices likely to fallComments
Global crude oil prices were ruling at four-year lows, raising hopes of another cut in the pump prices of petrol and diesel and a lower subsidy bill for the government.
Brent crude oil prices, taken as the benchmark by India for its oil imports, fell by $1.11 to $81.23 per barrel on Tuesday, its lowest since October 2010.
Oil companies had reduced petrol and diesel prices by Rs. 2.41 and Rs. 2.25 a litre respectively on October 31, when the Indian basket was hovering around $84.77 a barrel. Now, petrol and diesel prices could come down by another Rs. 1 to 1.50 per litre.
A revision in fuel prices is due on Saturday. Officials at Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest fuel retailing firm, said they were “closely monitoring” the international prices. Changes in the foreign exchange rate and trends in the global market will be reflected in price changes, they said.
India imports two-thirds of its energy needs. Lower diesel prices bring down the cost of transporting goods and help keep inflation low. This could in turn prompt the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates and eventually bring down installments on home and auto loans.
Softer crude prices also  help reduce fuel subsidies and contain the fiscal deficit — the amount the government borrows to fund its expenses — at the budgeted level of 4.1% of GDP for 2014-15.
With every dollar decrease in oil prices, the government’s oil import bill comes down by Rs. 4,000 crore. A $2-4 per barrel reduction in crude oil prices would lower India’s oil import bill by Rs. 8,000-16,000 crore. Oil imports cost India $145 billion a year.

Alibaba s Singles Day sales reach record $9.3 billionAlibaba's Singles Day sales reach record $9.3 billion

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said consumers spent a record $9.3 billion during its 24-hour shopping promotion Singles Day on Tuesday, cementing its position as the world's biggest online retail event.
Shoppers spent $3.5 billion, or 60%, more than the $5.8 billion sales recorded for the same day last year, the group said in a statement on Wednesday.
It also dwarfed the major shopping days in the US in terms of transaction value, toppling the combined online sales of $5.3 billion recorded on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday through to Cyber Monday last year, according to data compiled by internet analytics firm comScore.
Alibaba has been pushing November 11 as Singles Day -- so named for the number of ones in the date -- since 2009 as it looks to tap an expanding army of internet shoppers in China, which has the world's biggest online population.
The day was originally marketed as an "anti-Valentine's Day" in China, featuring hefty discounts to lure the country's singletons and price-sensitive buyers.
It was expanded globally this year to include more than 27,000 overseas brands and merchants as well as customers from more than 217 countries and regions.
Deals settled on Alibaba's China and international retail market places reached 57.1 billion yuan ($9.3 billion) for the day, the group said in the release.
The number of transactions made per minute peaked at 2.85 million, it added.
"We are very happy with the results of this year's 11.11 shopping festival," said Alibaba chief executive Jonathan Lu.
"We are particularly encouraged by the growing trend of consumers embracing mobile shopping on a global stage."
Approximately $4 billion of deals, or 42.6% of total, were made via mobile devices, according to the company.
Some 278.5 million packages were expected to be shipped after the event, it said.
The strong set of figures came against the backdrop of a growing online retail market in China and increasing spending power of consumers, analysts said. Nonetheless Alibaba shares, which have risen strongly since its record-breaking $25 billion initial public offering two months ago, dropped 3.87% to $114.54 in New York on Tuesday.
China overtook the United States last year to be the world's largest online retail market, with sales of 1.85 trillion yuan, commerce ministry statistics show.
Headquartered in the eastern city of Hangzhou, Alibaba does not sell products directly but acts as an electronic middleman, operating China's most popular consumer-to-consumer platform, Taobao, which is estimated to hold more than 90% of the market.

The benchmark BSE Sensex for the first time settled above the 28,000 level and NSE Nifty crossed 8,400 level on buying in auto, banking and FMCG stocks as falling crude prices boosted market sentiment on Wednesday.
The 30-share Sensex touched life-time high of 28,126.48 points before concluding at record closing level 28,008.90, posting gains of 98.84 points or 0.35%.
The BSE barometer had breached the 27,000 level on September 2 this year.
The 50-share Nifty also crossed 8,400 level to scale life-time high of 8,415.05 points. It closed at record high of 8,383.30, up by 20.65 points, or 0.25%.
"Markets are trading near their all-time high levels. Further fall in crude prices and expectations of further reforms kept sentiments positive," said Dipen Shah, head of private client group research, Kotak Securities.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth Rs. 458.04 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional data from stock exchanges.
"Markets are expecting the CPI (consumer inflation) to trend further lower. The fall in CPI over the past few months has led to expectations of an early interest rate cut," Shah added.
Among major Sensex gainers, Axis Bank rose the most by 3.02%, followed by Bajaj Auto (2.10%) and Tata Motors (1.71%).
Gains in ITC Ltd (1.55%), Hero MotoCorp (1.50%), ICICI Bank (1.33%) and HDFC Ltd (1.12%) also supported the indices to scale new peaks.
"Though the benchmarks were finally seen crossing the consolidation range on higher side but cautiousness among the participants kept the upside capped ahead of crucial economic data of CPI inflation and IIP numbers, which are scheduled post market," president of retail distribution in Religare Securities, Jayant Manglik, said.
Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel and NTPC were among major losers with losses of up to 3%.
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18%, followed by Bank index 1.12%, FMCG 0.96% and Consumer Durables index 0.55%.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47% and smallcap index by 0.20%.
Jignesh Chaudhary, head of research, Veracity Broking Services said, "Today (Wednesday) also, local equities traded strong to hit record high with the help of some blue chip companies."

Are you getting the internet speed you are paying for Probably notAre you getting the internet speed you are paying for? Probably not

Ajay Sharma, a Delhi based entrepreneur, uses his smart phone to send designs of suitcases and briefcases as high resolution pictures and 3D videos to his prospective clients across India. But slow internet speeds, often half or less of what he pays for, is seriously hampering his business.
"I have lost potential customers because of slow internet speeds. If the design does not upload or download on time; the discussion lingers on and sometimes gets dropped. I have lost potential business worth at least Rs. 10 lakh in the last few days," rues Sharma of AAR KAY Tools & Dyes in West Delhi.
"As an internet user I pay for a service, but I am not getting what is assured. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) should take action but it is not doing anything to force telecom operators to deliver what they promise," said Saleem Ahemad, vice president, Telecom User's Group, a consumer rights group registered with TRAI.
Sharma's said he gets mobile internet speeds below 100 kbps during 8am till 8pm on week days. Only between 10 pm and 7 am are the speeds at the promised 512 kbps.
The story is similar in other parts of the country. In Mumbai, Sujit Marar, who lives in the Vashi area, gets mobile internet speeds of 256 Kbps between 6 and 11am, 512 Kbps from 11am  to 5pm, and 256 Kbps again from 5pm to 11pm.
Shivaraj Prasad, who lives in Kilpauk area in Chennai, gets an even worse 64 Kbps during the entire day, from 9am to 9pm. He roams the city searching for 256 kbps in areas that have offices. On weekends, interestingly, he has even obtained 1 Mbps at his home. All these people have 512 Kbps data packets.
The problem is that India's telecom infrastructure - inadequate spectrum and a 30% deficit in the number of towers - is woefully unprepared to handle the country's exponentially rising internet subscriber base, which stood at 300 million at the end of October, 2014.
Of this, about 250 million access the internet via their mobile phones. Another 650 million mobile subscribers, who don't use their phones to access the Net, use the same towers and other infrastructure for making calls and sending messages.
Consider this: India needs 625,000 towers to provide quality voice and data services to all telecom and internet subscribers. But there are only 425,000 towers, leaving a gap of 200,000 towers.
"Telecom companies are not investing in technologies that can offer optimum spectrum utilisation. They are only adding more subscribers. So, the quality of service gets compromised," said Saleem Ahemad, vice president of Telecom Users Group, a leading consumer organisation registered with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).
Vodafone India managing director and CEO Marten Pieters agreed that operators do not always provide the internet speeds they promise.
"My company gives what it promises… but then, I was in an airport in Kerala and the (Vodafone) internet was not working. How can it work with five operators using five megahertz of spectrum? Unless the government gives us more spectrum and clearances to put up more towers, mobile internet speeds will not improve," Vodafone's Pieters said.
"Consumers cannot be made scapegoats in the fight between telecom operators and the government," said Ahemad.
You can check the download and upload speed of your connection at sites such as speedtest.net.in.
Except Vodafone, all the major telcos - Airtel, Idea Cellular, Reliance Communications and Tata Communications - declined to comment for this report.
The situation is expected to get worse in the coming months. Falling prices and rising sales of smartphone prices means more people are now accessing the internet. There are about 90 million smartphone users, or 10% of India's mobile subscriber base of 900 million, in India. This is projected to rise to more than 300 million by 2020. And there is precious little that the consumer can do about his slow data speeds, till the operators improve the infrastructure.
According to Trai, India will have 600 million broadband users by 2020, who will get a minimum internet speed of 2 megabits per second (Mbps) download speed. Higher speeds of at least 100 Mbps will then be available on demand. At 2 Mbps speed, a typical MP3 album of 100MB can be downloaded in five or 10 minutes.
"Operators need to improve their network management and not get fixated with more spectrum. We are holding discussions with them," said a senior official in Telecom Commission, the policy making wing of Department of Telecommunications.
"Each year we invest more than $10 billion (Rs 60,000 crore) in network expansion. This is in addition to the spectrum fee and taxes that we pay to the government," countered COAI's Mathews.
Meanwhile, consumers like Sharma and millions of others will continue to suffer.

Sensex off record high levels; oil cos plunge after excise hikeSensex off record high levels; oil companies plunge after excise hike

The benchmark BSE Sensex on Thursday fell from its all-time level to settle the day 68 points lower at 27,940.64 as investors became cautious after excise duty on petrol and diesel was hiked even as inflation cooled off and factory output grew in signs of economic recovery.
The Sensex rose in early trade on hopes of rate cut after inflation softened to 5.52% in October.
Three-month high industrial production growth of 2.5% in September also boosted the sentiment, brokers said.
But soon profit-booking emerged after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs. 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs. 13,000 crore in revenue.
Some investors fear this may weaken the fight against inflation, a broker said.
After a highly volatile trade, the bellwether index finally settled the day at 27,940.64, showing a loss of 68.26 points or 0.24% from Wednesday's close, snapping three days of rise.
The 50-share Nifty also lost by 25.45 points or 0.30% to 8,357.85.
On Wednesday, the benchmark index had ended at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90 and also hit intra-day high of 28,126.48 on sustained foreign funds inflows driven by economic reforms undertaken by the government recently.
Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors bought shares net of Rs. 459.47cr on Wednesday as per the provisional figures issued by stock exchanges.
The 30-share index in the previous three days had gained by 140.27 points or 0.50% in the last three days.
"Indian equity markets cheered CPI and IIP with benchmark indices opening higher... But profit-taking was seen at higher levels.
"OMC (oil marketing companies) stocks witnessed profit booking... most banking shares were also weak on the index while IT and pharma stocks lifted the index," said Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, director and CEO, WealthRays Securities.
Stocks of state-run BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil Corp ended up to 6.11% lower. ONGC was among the biggest Sensex losers, plunging by 2.03%, while RIL fell by 0.53%.
Major Sensex losers were SSLT (2.56%), Tata Power (2.47%), ONGC (2.03%), Gail (1.58%), Axis Bank (1.49%), Hero Motocorp (1.38%), HDFC (1.14%), SBI (0.84%) and ICICI Bank (0.83%).
Infosys rose by 1.77%, followed by Dr Reddy's Lab 1.01% and Cipla 0.91%.
Among the sectoral indices, Oil&Gas fell by 1.63%, followed by Realty 1.44%, Metal 0.76%, Bankex 0.71% and Auto 0.39%, while IT rose by 0.99% and Teck 0.74%.
The total market breadth turned negative as 1,733 stocks finished in the red, while 1,314 stocks closed in green. The total turnover dropped to Rs. 3,529.31 crore from Rs. 3,649.38 crore on Wednesday.
"The benchmarks were seen upholding sideways bias on Thursday as well, after the better than expected macro-economic data failed to trigger the directional move. In line with the key index, the sectoral indices too traded mixed whereas profit taking in the cash segment pushed the market breadth in the red," said Jayant Manglik, president of retail distribution, Religare Securities.
Sixteen scrips out of the 30-share Sensex pack ended lower while 14 others closed higher.
Asian markets were trading mixed.
Key indices in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore ended higher by 0.34-1.14%, while indices in China and South Korea finished lower by 0.34-0.36%.
European markets were trading higher as key indices in France, Germany and UK moved up by 0.31-1.01%.

How to Turn Adversaries Into AlliesIn 1959 a young baseball player in Japan signed his first professional contract to pitch for the Yomiuri Giants.  Unfortunately, he did poorly as a pitcher and was moved to play first base instead.
His hitting was also quite poor.  His batting average was .161 in his rookie season.
But his initial failure did not keep his spirits down for long.  In fact, he seemed to grow stronger as a result.
He worked hard with a batting coach for several years, getting better each season, until he eventually led his team - and soon the entire professional baseball league - in home runs for the season.
In 1980, when he retired, he was the third all-time leader in hits in Japan and he had hit 868 home runs, which is the record for lifetime home runs in Japan, and is over 100 home runs more than were hit by Barry Bonds, the home run king of the United States.
This player's name is Sadaharu Oh, commonly referred to as the "Japanese Babe Ruth."
Why was he so successful?
In addition to hard work and persistence in spite of early failures, Oh had a very unique approach to the game that may have been a significant factor in his success.  He didn't view opposing pitches as the enemy but rather as partners who gave him the opportunity to hit another home run.
This simple shift in view can be very helpful for successfully navigating our lives, as well.
In Oh's case, it is unlikely that the pitchers ever saw themselves as partners in his home-run-hitting exploits.  But perhaps his perspective helped pitchers to unconsciously become his partners.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could convert adversaries into partners in our personal and professional lives?
Imagine the effects this would have on our success.
I recently had the opportunity to interview Bob Burg, the bestselling author of Adversaries into Allies: Win People Over Without Manipulation or Coercion.  Bob has discovered a powerful process for systematically getting the results we want from others.
What makes this process so powerful is that instead of relying on manipulation to get what we want, the process allows us to create what Bob calls ultimate influence.  When we have such influence, we are able to get our needs met while simultaneously making others feel genuinely good about themselves, about the process, and about us.
Instead of creating a win-lose situation that will likely ruin a relationship, we create a win-win situation that actually strengthens relationships.
Here's an overview of the first four steps of the process that Bob shares for creating ultimate influence.
Control Your Own Emotions
Challenging emotions like anger, frustration, and jealousy are a natural part of being human.  However, they become problematic when they control our decisions and actions.
In order to have ultimate influence and be part of creating a win-win solution, we must learn how to be free from the control of our emotions.  As one of Bob's mentors likes to say, "Feel free to take your emotions along for the ride in life, but make sure that you are driving the car."
Understanding the Clash of Belief Systems
In our interview, Bob discussed how our belief systems - which shape our views about our world and what happens in it - are simply a product of our environment.  For the most part, these belief systems are essentially set by around the age of five.
When we understand that people have been molded - it is not something they consciously chose - to  see the world in a way that is perhaps quite different from how we see things, it helps us to be more understanding of others and less reactive.  This is key for being able to have a fruitful dialogue.
Acknowledge Their Ego
Most people have a strong sense of personal identity, which we call the ego.  By understanding how someone sees herself, we can be much more conscious of what would pose a threat to her identity, and tailor our solutions appropriately.
Also, when we remain conscious of the fact that people are often ego-driven, we can be much more understanding when people do things that seem counter-productive to us.  We see that such actions are very likely the result of a person feeling as though his identity is threatened in some way.
Set the Proper Frame
The frame for a situation is simply the context around it.  The frame can set the tone for how people act.
For instance, if a toddler falls down and the parents seem alarmed and worried, the child will likely see falling down as something scary, and cry.
However, as Bob witnessed at a local doughnut shop, when the parents of a toddler who took a tumble responded by cheering and applauding for the great stunt they witnessed, the child responded to the fall with laughter.
In every situation, there will be a frame set.  The question is simply: who will set it?
Bob suggests that we take the initiative to set the frame and make it a positive one.
We do that by understanding a person's desires, goals, and values and making sure that what we ask of them is well aligned with those desires, goals, and values.

Yen drops to seven-year low vs dollar as Japan election talk picks upHowever, there was little reaction in the market to data  showing Japan's third quarter economic contraction was deeper than initially reported.
The next major peak on technical charts comes in at 124.14 yen, the dollar's June 2007 high.
Forthcoming events such as Japan's general election on Dec. 14 and the U.S. Federal Reserve's Dec. 16-17 policy meeting are  unlikely to alter the dollar's overall trend, said a trader for a Japanese bank in Singapore.
While the dollar could falter if the Fed were to sound cautious about the economic outlook, "that may just be a good opportunity to buy (the dollar) on dips," he said.
Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar held steady at 89.362 <.DXY>, hovering near a five-year high of 89.467 set on Friday.
A break above the March 2009 high of 89.624 would take the dollar index to its highest level since April 2006.
The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.2289 , still near a two-year low of about $1.2270 set on Friday.
Not helping sentiment for the common currency, Standard & Poor's on Friday cut Italy's sovereign credit rating to BBB-, just one notch above junk.
For some analysts, the upbeat U.S. jobs report added to the case for the Fed to raise interest rates sooner rather than later, although the general expectation is for the rate increases to start around middle of 2015.
In stark contrast, the European Central Bank is under pressure to expand its asset-buying stimulus program.
While the ECB disappointed some by its inaction last week, President Mario Draghi gave his clearest signal yet that quantitative easing may be on the cards early in 2015.
"EUR/USD is on its way to below 1.20 for the first time in a decade," analysts at Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients, adding the greenback "still has plenty of room to the upside, and will be supported in 2015 by a sharp divergence in monetary policy."
Data showing a surprise drop in China's imports in November weighed on the Australian dollar, which touched a fresh four-year low on Monday. China is a major destination for Australia's commodities exports.
The Aussie dollar last traded at $0.8281 , down 0.4 percent on the day.

ND mulls rules to make crude safer for shipment... 
JAMES MacPHERSON | November 13, 2014 06:26 PM EST | Associated Press
BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota's top energy industry regulator unveiled new rules Thursday that would require companies to reduce the volatility of crude before it's shipped by rail.
State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms told the state Industrial Commission that all crude from North Dakota's oil patch would have to be treated to remove certain liquids and gases to "ensure it's in a stable state" before being loaded onto rail cars.
"The focus," Helms said, "is safety first."
Oil trains in the U.S. and Canada were involved in at least 10 major accidents during the last 18 months, including an explosion in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, that killed 47 people. Other trains carrying Bakken crude have since derailed and caught fire in Alabama, Virginia and North Dakota.
The Industrial Commission, which regulates North Dakota's oil and gas industry, appeared to agree with the proposal in principal but wanted more time for review. The panel said it would hold a special meeting by Dec. 11. The proposed rules, if adopted, would take effect in February.
Gov. Jack Dalrymple, who heads the commission, called the proposal "an excellent working draft." The panel also includes Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem and Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring as members.
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said in an interview that regulators are unfairly focusing on crude oil when the "root of the issue" is ensuring trains transport it safely.
Industry officials say stripping liquids and gases from Bakken crude would result in even more volatile products that would still have to be shipped by rail. It also would result in additional emissions due to heating the oil to remove gases, said Ness, whose group represents more than 500 companies working in the state's oil patch.
Ness said the group would submit comments on the new rules.
"We have some pretty significant concerns and there are a lot of unintended consequences," he said.
Helms said the goal is to ensure crude has a vapor pressure below 13.7 pounds per square inch, which is less than the 14.7 psi threshold that is recognized national standards as being stable.
About 80 percent of North Dakota crude already falls well below the proposed standard but required testing would ensure that all of it does, he said.
Winter blend gasoline that contains 10 percent ethanol is rated at 13.5 psi, Helms said.
The proposed rules will make North Dakota crude "behave like the gasoline you put in your car," Helms said.
The cost to industry to test crude to ensure compliance with the proposed standard will be "significant but not substantial," Helms said.
The proposed rules would not hinder investment or change "the economics of the Bakken," Helms said.

NY family accused of $20 million mortgage fraud... 
JIM FITZGERALD | November 13, 2014 06:09 PM EST | Associated Press
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) — Twelve members of a single Brooklyn-based family were charged Thursday with lying about being wealthy to obtain mortgages or lying about being poor to get food stamps and other benefits.
Some did both, the indictment said.
"They alternately played the part of prince or pauper depending on which scam was being perpetrated," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a news conference in the White Plains courthouse. "Regardless of whether they were posing as rich men or poor men, they were always con men."
He said one indicted couple claimed monthly income of $25,000 when taking out a mortgage and $180 when applying for food stamps and Medicaid.
The fraudulently obtained mortgages totaled more than $20 million and the welfare fraud realized about $700,000 in benefits, the indictment said.
Yehuda Rubin, 29, of Monroe, was described in the indictment as "an organizer" of the scheme but Bharara would not say he was the leader. Rubin's father, Irving Rubin, 58, of Brooklyn, is the lead defendant.
Both men pleaded not guilty later Thursday to charges of bank fraud and making false statements. The maximum penalty is 30 years in prison.
Other defendants include Irving Rubin's wife, another son, three brothers and five in-laws. Three unrelated men also were charged, including a real estate lawyer and an appraiser.
Eleven of the 15 defendants live in Brooklyn. Thirteen were arrested Thursday and the other two were expected to surrender, Bharara said.
The indictment said family members lied to lenders about their assets, income, employment and primary residence to obtain mortgages on at least 18 properties they claimed to own, most of them in Brooklyn.
The lies gave "the false appearance of creditworthiness, when in fact the assets and/or bank accounts were nonexistent" or were not fully owned by the applicant, the indictment said.
The defendants used the proceeds to pay their credit card debts and their own home mortgages and to fund other real estate projects, Bharara said.
When the loans defaulted, he said, the defendants would lie again, either to claim poverty or to claim they had found buyers who would take the properties — at a discount.
Bharara said the overall deception was so widespread that prosecutors still do not know exactly what properties the defendants own or how wealthy they are.
"It's hard to find any examples of when they told the truth," he said. But the government is asking the court to order forfeiture of 23 properties and several bank accounts.

Court wont annul ruling in US state no-baillawHundreds of immigrants who have been denied bail will now to be released after the US Supreme Court issued a ruling.
By: AP | Phoenix | Posted: November 14, 2014 4:52 am
Hundreds of immigrants who have been denied bail under a strict Arizona law will now have the opportunity to be released after the US Supreme Court issued a ruling Thursday in the closely watched case.
The high court kept intact a lower-court ruling from three weeks ago that struck down the law, which was passed in 2006 amid a series of immigration crackdowns in Arizona over the past decade. The law denies bail to immigrants who are in the country illegally and have been charged with a range of felonies that include shoplifting, aggravated identity theft, sexual assault and murder.
As a result, immigrants spend months in jail and often simply plead guilty and get turned over to federal immigration authorities for deportation.
The decision clears the way for a wave of bail hearings for immigrants across Arizona.
An 11-member panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the law last month, ruling it violates due-process rights by imposing punishment before trial. The panel also said the law was a “scattershot attempt” at confronting people who flee from authorities, and that there was no evidence the law dealt with a particularly critical problem.
Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Attorney Bill Montgomery defended the law. Their attorney argued the 9th Circuit ruling called into question categorical bans on bail in several states and said an official responsible for bail proceedings has already scheduled hearings for next week.
The law’s defenders say the ruling calls into question bans on bail for various reasons in 40 states. Four states — Arizona, Missouri, Alabama and Virginia — have laws confronting the issue of bail for immigrants.
In denying the stay, the Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit decision, at least for now. But Justice Clarence Thomas said he went along only because it was clear that the required four of nine justices would not vote to review the case.
Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, called that “unfortunate.” He wrote that the high court has long had a practice of reviewing rulings that overturn state or federal laws, but “for reasons that escape me, we have not done so with any consistency, especially in recent months.”
Thomas then went on to question why the high court has repeatedly declined in recent months to block a series of lower federal court decisions overturning state gay marriage bans. In the no-bail case, “at the very least, we owe the people of Arizona the respect of our review before we let stand a decision facially invalidating a state constitutional amendment.”
Thomas wrote that the court hasn’t yet seen a full petition for review in the no-bail case and hopes his prediction that the court will turn it down is proven wrong.

Syrians fleeing civil war face  new level of hopelessness : reportResidents rescue a man after what activists said was shelling from forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad in Aleppo's Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood, February 8, 2014. (Source: Reuters photo)
By: Associated Press | United Nations | Posted: November 13, 2014 10:12 am
A new report says the plight of people fleeing Syria’s civil war has reached “a new level of hopelessness” as overstretched neighbors make it more difficult to escape and developed countries like the United States resettle a tiny number of refugees. Less than 2 percent have been given a new home.
The report released Wednesday by the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council says the number of refugees from Syria has dropped sharply, with 18,483 registered in October, while an average of 150,000 were registered each month in 2013 with the United Nations refugee committee.
“We are witnessing a total collapse of international solidarity with millions of Syrian civilians,” Norwegian Refugee Council Secretary General Jan Egeland said in a statement.
Syria’s neighbors, including Lebanon and Jordan, have warned they were at the breaking point. Tiny Lebanon last month began rejecting all but “exceptional” refugee cases.
About 3.3 million people have fled Syria during the 3-year civil war. Lebanon, with a population of just 4.5 million, has taken in about a third of them. Millions more are displaced inside Syria.
Syria’s neighbors, also including Turkey and Iraq, say the tide of refugees has strained resources and threatened political stability. The report praises them for taking in millions of people.
“In September and October 2014 alone, Turkey received 190,000 refugees, far more than the entire international community has committed to resettle since the start of the Syrian conflict,” the report says. That surge occurred as people fled attacks by the Islamic State group.
Meanwhile, European countries and the U.S. have been extremely reluctant to accept Syria’s refugees.
The United States had resettled just 166 refugees from Syria by the end of September, the new report says. While the U.S. is the world’s largest resettlement country, it has not yet said how many Syrian refugees it will accept.
The U.S. “needs to do more, and quickly,” the report says.
So far, France has said it will resettle just 500 refugees and Britain a few hundred, the report adds.
The International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council are asking that developed countries move quickly to make sure that at least 5 percent of Syria’s refugees are able to “access protection,” including resettlement, outside the region.
So far, countries outside the region have agreed to take in just 50,000 refugees, or less than 2 percent, the report says.
The aid groups also call on the international community to rush urgent humanitarian aid to Syria’s neighbors to help them support the burden.

European probe Philae lands on comet  fails to anchorA handout artist impression showing lander Philae separating from the Rosetta spacecraft and descending to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, made available by the European Space Agency (ESA) on November 12, 2014. (Source: Reuters)

Europe has made history by placing the first-ever lander on a comet – but the robot failed to anchor itself properly, raising concerns at ground control.
The fridge-sized lab dubbed Philae touched down on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in a high-risk manoeuvre more than 510 million kilometres (320 million miles) from Earth, the European Space Agency (ESA) said Wednesday.
But instead of harpooning itself to the surface after a seven-hour descent from mothership Rosetta, early radio signals suggest Philae could have settled in a soft surface or gently lifted off and then redescended.
“So maybe today we didn’t once, we even landed twice,” Philae lander manager Stephan Ulamec quipped at ground control in Darmstadt, Germany a few hours after touchdown.
“Hopefully, we are sitting there on the surface at a position slightly different to the original landing and can continue our science.”

Several instruments onboard Philae had already sent back “plenty of data,” he said.
Engineers are yet to figure out what prevented the 100-kilo (220-pound) lander from shooting its duo of harpoons into the comet’s surface to prevent it drifting away from its low-gravity host. Nor is its fate entirely clear.
“Did we just land in a soft sandbox and everything is fine even though we are not anchored… or is there something else happening?” said Ulamec.
With communications between Philae and its parent severed for the coming hours, expected as Rosetta disappears in orbit behind the comet, there may be scant information before a media briefing planned for 1300 GMT today.
There was cause for celebration as Philae separated from Rosetta as scheduled and headed for “67P” after a decade-long trek covering 6.5 billion kilometres (four billion miles).
A crowd of scientists, guests and VIPS, including two Ukrainian astronomers who discovered the comet in 1969, then cheered as the signal arrived on Earth to confirm contact with the comet.
“This is a big step for human civilisation,” said ESA director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain.
“Our ambitious Rosetta mission has secured another place in the history books. Not only is it the first to rendezvous with and orbit a comet, but it is now also the first to deliver a probe to a comet’s surface.”
Jim Green, director of planetary science at NASA, heaped praise on the feat.
“How audacious, how exciting, how unbelievable to be able to dare to land on a comet, to take that step that we’ve all wanted from a scientific perspective,” he said.

Boost pressure on Russia over Ukraine  US tells UN councilUS told UNSC there needs to be greater international pressure on Russia to abide by a ceasefire in Ukraine.
By: Reuters | United Nations | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:04 am
The United States told the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday there needs to be greater international pressure on Russia to abide by a ceasefire in Ukraine, as Russia denied it was a threat to its neighbour.
The 15-member council held its 26th meeting on Ukraine. A ceasefire agreed by pro-Russian rebels and Ukraine on September 5 in the Belarussian capital of Minsk is now all but dead and Western fears of a return to all-out conflict are growing.
Ukraine said on Wednesday it was redeploying troops in the east because of fears separatists will launch a new military offensive, despite Russia’s denials it sent troops to reinforce the rebels.
“What we need to do is keep ratcheting up the pressure on Russia until it abides by Minsk and chooses the path of de-escalation,” US Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told the Security Council.
The United States and the European Union started imposing economic sanctions on Moscow in response to Russia’s seizure of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in March, a month after the overthrow of a Moscow-backed president in Kiev after protests.
European Union foreign ministers are due to meet in Brussels on Monday but are unlikely to step up sanctions against Russia, EU diplomats said on Wednesday.
NATO’s top military commander Philip Breedlove said in Bulgaria the alliance had spotted military equipment arriving from Russia in regions of east Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatist rebels.
Russia’s Deputy UN Ambassador Alexander Pankin told the Security Council that NATO’s assessment did not reflect the situation on the ground and was an “empty statement and the usual propagandistic falsifications.”
In comments directed at Ukraine UN Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev, he said: “The equipment and forces that the Russian armed forces have are on the territory of my country and they’re not threatening yours, they are not moving from my country.”
Russia on Tuesday abstained from a Security Council vote to renew authorization for an EU military operation in Bosnia because it said the mission could be viewed as a bid to accelerate the country’s integration into the EU and NATO. Moscow previously voted in favor of the EU operation.
A senior council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said this was the first example of a spillover of the disagreements over Ukraine into other council issues.

Australia on Thursday said it is tracking four Russian navy ships off its north coast, a move Prime Minister Tony Abbott said was a sign of Moscow’s military assertiveness with relations strained after the downing of Flight MH17 in Ukraine.
The appearance of the fleet coincides with Vladimir Putin’s arrival at the G20 summit in Brisbane this weekend and follows a highly anticipated exchange between the Russian leader and Australian premier Tony Abbott in Beijing. Putin’s presence in Brisbane was questioned given Australia’s anger at the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in July, in which 298 people died in rebel-held eastern Ukraine, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.
But the G20’s consensus was that he should attend despite Kiev and the West claiming the plane was blown out of the sky with a missile supplied by Russia, an allegation Moscow denies. “Defence is monitoring Russian naval vessels that are currently transiting through international waters to the north of Australia,” the Australian Defence Force said in a statement.
Australian media reports said they include a “heavily armed” cruiser and destroyer, a tug boat and a refuelling vessel. Australia said the Russian navy has previously been deployed in conjunction with major international summits. A warship from Russia’s Pacific Fleet accompanied former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev’s visit to San Francisco in 2010.
John Blaxland, an international security expert at the Australian National University, said having ships off Australian waters was “huff and puff” by Putin designed to reinforce his “tough, he-man image”. “This is a show of force, a stage-managed event and is all for show,” he told AFP.
“People don’t go around doing this unless they feel insecure and need to assert themselves. It’s consistent with Putin’s chest-out, posturing behaviour. It bolsters his domestic credentials.” Abbott famously vowed to “shirtfront” Putin – an Australian Rules football term in which a player charges an opponent – in Brisbane over the downing of MH17.
The pair met on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Beijing this week without incident. continued…

Nepal: Slamming Prachanda  Bhattarai says Constitution will be drafted in assembly  not streetPrint
Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai said revolutionary forces need to collaborate and cooperate with each other for consolidating democratic achievements. (Source: Reuters photo)

Striking a dissent note with fellow comrade Prachanda, Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai on Thursday said that his party is committed to draft the new constitution within the Constituent Assembly.
His remarks came after United Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (UCPN-M) Chairman Prachanda’s threat to unilateraly announce the constitution from the street, if major political parties failed to forge consensus on key issues including the number of federal units.
“People will announce their own constitution through the street, if ruling parties go ahead by disregarding the voice of the opposition parties,” Prachanda on Wednesday said in Rolpa district, considered Maoists’ headquarters during the decade-long insurgency.
Bhattarai said revolutionary forces need to collaborate and cooperate with each other for consolidating democratic achievements.
They fought the democratic struggle jointly and initiated the peace process by a 12-point agreement signed in New Delhi between the then underground Maoist party and other democratic parties, he said.
Maoist Vice-President Narayankaji Shrestha said his party is committed to promulgating the constitution by January 22, 2015 as agreed by the political parties and the party is ready to show flexibility for the sake of forging consensus.
He also dismissed the allegation made by ruling parties that UCPN-Maoist has abandoned the path of dialogue and consensus saying: “we are not obstructing the process of drafting the new constitution as claimed by the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML.”
“We are ready to sit for dialogue to forge consensus on key issues of the constitution,” he added.
The ruling parties Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist are saying they would opt for voting process to settle the disputed issues of drafting the new constitution if no consensus emerges.
The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML command two-third majority in the 601-membered Constituent Assembly, which is sufficient to draft the new constitution.
However, opposition parties including UCPN-Maoist and Madhesis based parties are pressing to settle the disputed issues of the constitution.
Political parties are yet to agree on forms of governance, federal structure and judiciary system.

How brave investors made $12.8B in a monthHow brave investors made $12.8B in a month

Investors know real money is made when others are fearful. That’s even more true when they buy the right stocks that scare investors the most.
Scooping up the seven stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 that cratered 20% during the market’s freakout in late September and early October and raced back with a vengeance — including energy firms Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Newfield (NFX) in addition to tech firm Microchip Technology (MCHP) — turned out to be extremely lucrative for brave investors. These stocks are all up more than 10% from the market’s Ebola-panic induced bottom on Oct. 15 — creating $12.8 billion in market value.
Such breathtaking bouncebacks are a reminder of the impressive money-making power of having nerves of steel during times of market trouble — but also a a huge helping of luck. Here’s why. Investors actually had much better odds simply buying the market itself at the bottom and riding it higher. Of the 21 S&P 500 stocks that dropped 20% or more during the market decline — 14 of them actually bounced back less than the market’s 9.4% gain.
Still, the big winner from the beat down is Chesapeake Energy. Shares of the energy exploration company tanked 28% from the market’s Sept. 18, 2014 peak to the Oct. 15 low. But investors looking for a way to play the bounceback got it and then some. Shares of the company are up 32% from the bottom — creating $3.7 billion in market value.
Clearly, playing the bottom is risky business as many of the hammered stocks limped higher or still haven’t bounced back. First Solar (FSLR) is a example of a stock that’s in a downward trajectory that even a market bounceback hasn’t mended. Shares of the solar-panel company fell 26% during the market’s pullback. And from the market’s low, they’re down further still: 6.9%.
Catching the bottom, is seems, is very difficult. But oh, the rewards are so great when you do.

Parks group sues to keep Lucas museum off Chicago s lakefront5
A memorandum of understanding between the Park District and the museum specifies that the land where the museum would be located will continue to be owned by the Park District and the cost of constructing and maintaining the building will be paid by the museum.
The memorandum says that the museum “shall have full and exclusive operational control of the museum building” so long as it continues to operate as a museum.
Friends of the Parks President Cassandra Francis said her group views the arrangement as being equivalent to a private entity taking over a public space.
“The city does not have control over what goes into the museum, does not have control over access to the museum,” Francis said. “And while the land may be owned by the Chicago Park District … if it is a long-term lease, it starts looking a lot like ownership.”
Under the group’s legal theory, the General Assembly should decide whether approving the lakefront development would be in keeping with the state’s obligations as a trustee: to preserve the land and make it accessible to the public.
Geoghegan cited Navy Pier as an example of shoreline construction that could clear that test because the pier “actually enhances people’s ability to get to the lakefront.”
But even if lawmakers were to approve the Lucas Museum site, Friends of the Parks would continue to oppose it and would argue that the state had failed in its duty to uphold the public trust, Geoghegan said.
“What this suit is intended to do is to ensure that the lakefront is protected in the future,” he said. “There’s not that much space left and we have to hold on and fight for what we have.”
Much of Chicago along the lake is built on landfill, but Geoghegan said his argument does not have anything to do with structures that have already been built on landfill. Whether existing buildings should have been allowed under the public trust doctrine “is a question that belongs to the past,” he said.

Cobol to Chinese  IT cos bridge the language...IT companies offering language training to employees to conduct smooth business operations

(“As the scope for business…)
MUMBAI: It's not enough for employees working in the information technology industry to be acquainted with the various languages of software. A little bit of Japanese, Mandarin or Spanish on the side helps a great deal as well.
With Indian IT spreading its sphere of influence to European and Latin American continents and Japan, companies are offering language training courses to employees in order to meet demand from clients and conduct quick and smooth business operations. The courses are offered online or in tie-ups with language training institutes.
"As the scope for business in geographies expands, we are looking at giving much more importance to linguistic requirements," says Nitin Pande - senior vice president, HR employee services lead, at HCL Technologies .
With increased business in Japan, HCL is on the lookout for candidates well versed in Japanese. It has tied up with colleges in Japan to hone the linguistic skills of Indian onsite employees. Freshers who know the language are sent to Japan to help out with interactions between employees and customers. The Delhibased firm even started a club called Polyglots in 2012 to promote cultural diversity and multilinguism.
"Employees need to realise that learning a foreign language helps in connecting better with the client and also gives insights into their culture, traditions and ways of working," says Pande.
TCS is also keen on inculcating an awareness of Japanese. "We are seeing more employees take up Japanese, since the Mitsubishi deal," says Ajoyendra Mukherjee, global head of human resources at Tata Consultancy Services. In April, TCS announced it was acquiring Mitsubishi's IT arm, which has about $500 million in revenue a year, and about 2,400 employees.
Infosys , where onsite employees are responsible for about a quarter of the manhours billed, found that the knowledge of languages increased when employees travelled onsite or moved up the career path at the project manager-level. "Today many European clients prefer and, sometimes, expect teams to have a basic or working knowledge of the language, which facilitates better understanding of their culture," says Srikantan Moorthy, EVP and head HR, Infosys. This is also the case with Japanese and Chinese clients, he says.
The Bangalore-based tech major offers employees opportunities to learn Spanish, German, French and Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese. Those in the sales, infrastructure management, digital services-led business need language training more than others.
IT firms are adopting a blend of online training and tie-ups with local colleges to promote local languages amongst their Indian employees. Over the next financial year, Tech Mahindra Business Services Group will build long-term language capabilities both at onsite and offshore locations through relationships with local colleges, universities and training institutes.
Although IT companies hire a large chunk of their onsite employees from local geographies, language institutes in India have noted the need amongst freshers to be well versed in a global tongue. "90% of my class learns Spanish to get a better job abroad. A majority of them are in the IT and ITeS sector," says Subhransu Banerjee, assistant professor at Instituto Cervantes, New Delhi.
"Knowing two or more foreign languages apart from English adds to their advantage and makes business sense to us," says Rajeev Narang, global head - HR, Tech Mahindra Business Services Group. The IT firm requires employees for its Latin American and European business to know a global language, specially in customer service, sales and retention, tech support, healthcare and pharma.

Black Friday doesn't have the best deals

The monikers Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become linguistic pawns in the retail discount game as stores take "doorbusters" digital and dangle "Black Friday" sales in front of customers weeks before the actual event.
Now, Thanksgiving is officially better than Black Friday when it comes to getting deals, according to a report from Adobe Systems. But shoppers don't even have to wait until then to take home hot products at the cheapest prices.
Black Friday is "more of an idea than a single-day event anymore," says Calvin Silva, lead retail analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services.
Enter the pre-Black Friday sale. In the never-ending race to stay ahead of the competition, retailers are rolling out deeper discounts earlier. Target, Walmart, Amazon, Kohl's, Toys R Us, Sears and Staples are all planning pre-Black Friday sales, some of which have already started.
More retailers offering last-minute Christmas delivery
Online prices will hit their lowest point on Thanksgiving, with an average discount of 24%, according to Adobe. That beats any other day of the holiday season. Prices will still be an average of 20% off the week leading up to Thanksgiving, and online and in-store prices are generally expected to match, other than with store-specific Black Friday promotions, Adobe says. As online and mobile shopping grows in popularity every year, retailers are trying to compete with the fact that customers can access goods online anytime they want, says Jon Lal, CEO of coupon site BeFrugal.com. Walmart is calling its campaign the "new Black Friday."
"Black Friday is no longer about waking up at the crack of dawn to stand in long lines and hope for the best," Walmart's Chief Merchandising Officer Duncan Mac Naughton said about the company's holiday plans. In a call with media he added, "I think you're going to see chapters of activity throughout the month."
Retailers say they're responding to customer demand, though deal experts say the earlier sales are just as much, if not more, of a strategic decision.
"It's not necessarily consumers (who) want to get out there and shop earlier," says Loren Bendele, president of discount website Savings.com. "It's just retailers trying to get those sales sooner and therefore stealing from their competition. If you're going to buy a big-screen TV, you're only going to buy one, so whoever gets it first wins."
Dates you need to know for holiday shopping
A Savings.com analysis of deals from the past five years, released this week, found that the number of deals available from retailers peak the week before Thanksgiving. Although the best time to buy depends on what you're looking for, Bendele says. The Savings.com data found that the best day to buy toys is the day before Thanksgiving, while your best bet for electronics is the very beginning of November. The website also found that holiday deals advertised as early as October more than doubled between 2009 and 2013.

Consumers who have started shopping say they're already finding attractive deals. Michele Polanski, a 33 year-old from Fort Worth, says she saw Black Friday-like prices at Gap in the past week while shopping for clothes for her family's holiday picture. She says the experience has made her less likely to want to shop on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.
"Not everybody has the desire to go out on Black Friday because it's a zoo," Polanski says. "I feel like the retailers are making it easier to get the same kind of deals but not have to endure that."
But you can't completely disregard the magnitude of deals on Black Friday, says Brian Hoyt, spokesperson for deal website RetailMeNot, though he concedes Black Friday no longer stands out as much as it once did. The average savings on Black Friday last year was 37%, the same as on Thanksgiving and the following Saturday, according an analysis of offers on RetailMeNot.
"The reality is that the five days of savings from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday are still the most active, deepest discounts and most savings consumers experience throughout the year," he says.
This year Black Friday will be about showcasing deals on specific items like HD TVs and gaming systems, where shoppers care more about price than about where they buy the product, Silva says. Consumers looking for new clothes should start shopping now, though, while apparel retailers are already pushing steep discounts, he says. With the rise in online and mobile shopping, Black Friday has become less important as a day for blowout sales.
"Retailers are understanding that they've also got other channels that they can leverage," Silva says. "They don't really need to count on all of the volume being moved on that day."

India has fervour of entrepreneurship but not many investors to fund it

Entrepreneurship
(Indian entrepreneurship…)
It will be inescapable to even the casual observer that there is a fervour for entrepreneurship in India the like of which has never been seen before. Several hundred companies are born each year, and investors are backing them with billions of dollars.
Erstwhile startups such as Flikpkart and Mu Sigma are competing against the biggest companies in the world. And bright young students are opting to start up instead of choosing jobs with fat salaries. All in all, a very satisfying scenario.
A closer look will reveal that while Indian entrepreneurship is experiencing its finest phase yet, many dangers lurk too. And the most severe danger at this time relates to money— not the absence of it but the quality of the cash and its ability to deliver handsome returns. Money is the lifeblood of enterprises and if it doesn't flow, startups are bound to choke.
Investors normally wait for about seven years before they expect a return from a startup investment. In India, the flowering of startup activity, and the accompanying investor interest, started in 2007. So we are nearing the end of a cycle and approaching the time when investors expect to be reaping their rewards. But no such thing is happening. Startups may have grown, entrepreneurship may be the in thing to do, and new money is chasing new startups but many older investors have not been able to harvest any gains yet.
For example, in the last three years, about $3 billion (Rs 18,000 crore) has been invested by seed and venture capital firms in Indian startups. In the same period, payback has been just over $1 billion, says data from iSpirt, the software product think-tank and investment bank Signal Hill. This only demonstrates the magnitude of the challenge.
Part of the reason for this is that the public equity markets have been languishing for a long time. Share indices are looking better now and some of the larger internet companies may list overseas next year, but for the bulk of Indian startups an IPO is only a distant dream. What is worse is that larger companies are wary of paying top dollar for local startups. Some prefer to pay good money overseas but not in India.
For those looking to earn a fortune in double quick time, Indian startups are not the answer. On an average, if an early-stage venture in the United States is sold for about $150 million, in India it would fetch about $11 million.
So what gives? If this state of affairs where exits are few and far between continue, India will not continue to attract the attention of top-notch investors. This has implications for entrepreneurship and the broader economy. The clearest and simplest first step is for Indian companies and capital to step up their game when it comes to startups. Foreign investors have been the big beneficiaries of the bloom in Indian entrepreneurship so far. Rupee money is just beginning to trickle, showing us up as followers, not leaders. Here is an opportunity to make the move early by paying good money to buy several of the promising startups that have made their name both at home and overseas. The technology companies with the big money know which ones we are talking about.

Ex-DHS official warns of more USIS breach victims... 
STEPHEN BRAUN | November 13, 2014 05:53 PM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — A massive cyberbreach that compromised the private files of more than 25,000 Department of Homeland Security workers earlier this year also exposed data belonging to numerous workers at other federal agencies, a former senior DHS official said Friday.
Christopher Cummiskey, who recently left his post as acting undersecretary for management at DHS, said Thursday that government investigators from several agencies are still identifying the precise numbers of those affected. He added the final tally could represent thousands more employees.
Cummiskey said that officials found similarities between the techniques used by intruders in the incident at U.S. Investigations Services LLC and during an earlier breach at the Office of Personnel Management that was later linked to Chinese hackers.
The USIS breach, which was reported by the company to government officials last June, was the first of a series of high-profile cyber intrusions in recent months that have alarmed congressional and computer security experts and raised calls for more government scrutiny and coordination. Late last month, hackers reportedly traced to Russia penetrated some White House computers. And a massive intrusion at the U.S. Post Office, reported just this week and also linked to China, compromised the data of as many as 800,000 postal workers.
Speaking at a cybersecurity forum at the Center for National Policy think tank in Washington, Cummiskey said government agencies need to share information about breaches as soon as they are notified. He said DHS contracting officials were slow in alerting other agency officials to the severity of the USIS breach after the company reported the incident last June.
Cummiskey said that the hackers who struck at USIS penetrated through the company-designed data management system, known as Orion. He said it took months before the company noticed the intrusion and that once hackers gained entry, they easily moved from DHS workers to other government agency employees. There were no firewalls separating the files belonging to each agency, Cummiskey said.
"Once they were in, the hackers were able to pack their bags with anything they wanted," Cummiskey said.
Cummiskey did not identify the other agencies that used the Orion system but a person familiar with USIS contracts said workers from at least one Department of Defense intelligence agency had private and financial data in that network. The person familiar with USIS contracts spoke anonymously because of an ongoing FBI criminal investigation into the breach.
A USIS spokeswoman declined to comment. The company previously said that the attack struck at a computer server run by an unidentified "third party." The company also said earlier that cyberstrikes often take months to detect and that USIS' computer systems had previously been reviewed and approved by OPM officials.
Cummiskey said that DHS' contract with USIS was faulty because it did specify rigorous computer security and data-management practices. He said investigators found that the compromised Orion system contained old background check reports that should have been deleted.
"There were too many old reports floating around," Cummiskey said.

UN official wants international support in fight against BokoHaramUN's representative for central Africa has called on more international support in the struggle against Boko Haram.
By: Agence-France Presse | Libreville | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:03 am
The UN’s special representative for central Africa has called on increased international support in the struggle against Boko Haram, with thousands of Nigerians having fled and cross-border attacks on the rise.
“Deadly attacks by Boko Haram have gone beyond Nigeria’s borders and now constitute a threat for neighbouring countries,” Abdoulaye Bathily told reporters in the Gabon capital Libreville yesterday.
“Cameroon is one of the main victims,” he added, referring to Nigeria’s neighbour to the east.
Bathily said he was launching “an appeal to the international community to mobilise more in support of states’ efforts in the battle against this terrorist group, whose atrocities have caused a worrying stream of refugees in neighbouring countries.”
Between June and October, more than 17,000 Nigerians have arrived at a refugee camp in Minawao, northern Cameroon, he said.
Local officials and those from the UN refugee agency estimate between 4,000 and 5,000 new arrivals in the region each week, many of them women and children requiring immediate attention.
“If nothing is done urgently, it is very likely that a humanitarian disaster will follow that would further complicate the security challenges,” said Bathily.
Boko Haram’s five-year insurgency based in northeastern Nigeria has killed thousands and forced scores to flee their homes. Nigerian security forces have in turn been accused of major abuses, including extra-judicial killings and indiscriminate arrests.
The extremists have in recent weeks seized a growing amount of territory in Nigeria’s northeast. The group has claimed to be fighting for the creation of an Islamic state and for the release of detained members.

Fracking accident kills 1  injures 2 in Colorado... 
November 13, 2014 06:57 PM EST | Associated Press
GREELEY, Colo. (AP) — One worker was killed and two others were seriously injured in a fracking accident at an oil or gas well site in northern Colorado.
Three men were trying to heat a frozen high-pressure water line when something went wrong and the line ruptured Thursday.
Weld County sheriff's Sgt. Sean Standridge says one man was hit by a stream of water and died from the impact. The accident happened near Mead, about 35 miles north of Denver, on the fourth straight day of frigid weather in the region.
The men were working for Halliburton Co., which Anadarko Petroleum Corp. contracted to perform fracking operations at the well.
The injured men — 48-year-old Thomas Sedlmayr and 28-year-old Grant Casey — were flown to hospitals. The name of the man who was killed hasn't been released.

Baker Hughes says in deal talks with Halliburton...and
versions
HOUSTON (AP) — Oilfield-services provider Baker Hughes Inc. said Thursday it is talks with rival Halliburton Co. about a potential merger.
The company's brief statement late Thursday said there was no guarantee that a deal would be done and offered no further details.
It came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Halliburton was in talks to buy Baker Hughes. At the start of trading Thursday, Baker Hughes' stock market value was $22 billion.
Representatives from Halliburton declined to comment
The deal talk between the two Houston-based companies comes during a drop in oil prices that has hurt both companies' stock price.
Halliburton, Baker Hughes and a third major competitor, Schlumberger Ltd., help energy companies find and extract oil and gas.
Combined, Halliburton and Baker Hughes would be slightly larger by revenue than Schlumberger, and hold an even larger advantage in North America, where hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a big business for the oilfield companies.
"They would be so dominant that you may even see some pushback" from regulators, Benjamin Schuman, an analyst with Drexel Hamilton LLC in New York, told The Associated Press. "Folks could be concerned. You could have one player with close to 40 percent market share if nothing is divested or shut down."
A combination could give Halliburton and Baker Hughes more power to charge energy companies higher prices, particularly in North America. But the effect on consumers would be minor because oilfield services are a relatively small part of overall energy prices, Schuman said.
Baker Hughes shares closed up 15 percent at $58.75. They added another 3 percent in extended trading after the company confirmed the deal talks. Halliburton gained 56 cents, or about 1 percent, to close at $53.79 and tacked on another 68 cents in after-hours trading.

Malloy budget chief sticking to no tax hike pledge... 
SUSAN HAIGH | November 13, 2014 07:06 PM EST | Associated Press
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's budget chief said Thursday it will be difficult but he plans to adhere to his boss's campaign promise and craft a new two-year state budget that does not increase taxes despite deficit projections.
"It's going to be an enormous challenge, but I look forward to carrying it out," Ben Barnes, secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, told The Associated Press. He added: "We're going to submit a budget that's balanced. It is going to entail spending reductions below the current services level."
Barnes is in the beginning stages of crafting a budget recommendation for Malloy to present to the General Assembly in February. His comments come a day after he sent a memo to state agency heads, instructing them to "eliminate, minimize or delay those expenditures that are not absolutely critical in nature." On Monday, new revenue estimates showed the current year, which ends on June 30, is short about $59 million in state revenue.
Barnes said Thursday that much of that $59 million stems from late payments from the federal government for various Medicaid initiatives. He called the $59 million a "manageable" revenue loss to overcome.
Meanwhile, a new report is expected to be released Friday that will outline projected cost overruns for the current fiscal year's budget. The General Assembly's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis has estimated those budget deficiencies to be about $80 million, which Barnes said "is not an unreasonable number." Those overruns include higher-than-expected retiree health care expenses, which Barnes said could change before the fiscal year ends.
State Rep. Themis Klarides, R-Derby, the new House Republican leader for the coming legislative session, said she believes this new projected $59 million revenue shortfall is a sign of bigger problems for Connecticut's budget.
"The reality is, it's a continued erosion of our state's fiscal health," she said, adding how legislative Republicans were critical of the revenue numbers that were plugged into the budget at the last minute to balance the tax-and-spending plan.
Klarides said Malloy disagreed throughout the recent election that the state faced serious budget issues.
"Every TV ad, every debate, every time the governor spoke, he denied there was a significant problem," she said. "But now, together, we have to address it."
The fiscal analysis office has projected a $1.4 billion deficit in the new fiscal year that begins July 1. Malloy said that figure assumes future budgets will spend more than what he plans to present.  During a Sept. 30 debate with Republican Tom Foley, who repeatedly criticized Malloy for raising taxes in 2011 to cover a budget deficit,  the Democrat said: "I don't believe there will be a budget deficit, and I've pledged that were won't be one and I've also pledged that there will not be a tax increase."
Barnes contends there are reasons to be optimistic, saying retail sales are relatively strong and Connecticut's underlying economy is stabilizing. Also, he also argues that state spending has been well-controlled this year, pointing out that $80 million in cost overruns represents only one half of one percent of the overall state budget. He said the spending limits outlined to agency heads, including the curtailing of new hires, could be lifted as the fiscal situation changes.

Ponzi prince Sudipta Sen knew Saradha crash was coming
Ponzi Prince and chief architect of the Rs 2,459 crore Saradha scam Sudipta Sen knew well before the whistle finally blew that his game was up.
Mail Today –  Thu 13 Nov, 2014

NEW DELHI: The Sen song of the Saradha Scam has been unveiled, and it makes for some pretty interesting listening.
Ponzi Prince and chief architect of the Rs 2,459 crore Saradha scam Sudipta Sen knew well before the whistle finally blew that his game was up.
The high-profile investigation into the investment scam that continues to rock Bengal’s political establishment and snare heavyweights has now revealed that Sen, in his deposition recorded under Section 240 (2) of the Companies Act, 1956 stated that “the returns at higher rates were promised but it is not possible to provide such returns with a business model followed by the companies”.
Corroborating Sen’s line of thinking, his accomplice in the defrauding of thousands of investors, Debjani Mukherjee, said in her statement before the Enforcement Directorate: “It was known to Sudipta Sen by April 2013 that the company was doomed. Whenever she asked him (Sen) whether the company would be able to continue to pay the returns to the public, Sen said he knew “how to return the money to the public. The business belongs to him, but it is true, maybe not in April 2013, but someday it will come down crashing.”
As much as 93 per cent of the total collections were in cash. No less than Rs 1,983 crore of the Rs 2,459 crore is still outstanding from depositors who put in less than Rs 50,000 each. Of this, Rs 242.62 crore has been misappropriated by Sen, Mukherjee and other directors for their personal benefit.
The source
An extremely damaging 516-page Serious Fraud Investigation Office report reveals this and much more. A report by the SFIO - part of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs set-up to investigate white collar crime - provides a comprehensive and overarching account of the way Saradha Group companies deceived and fraudulently induced depositors, by offering an abnormally high 18 per cent return. It also shows how the Sen cookie crumbled.
Monthly Income Scheme (MIS) deposits, for instance, collected Rs 416.30 crore over 34 months and a paltry Rs 89 crore was paid out as part of the pyramid scheme to investors.
Saradha Realty India Ltd collected Rs 774.32 crore from 2008-09 to 2012-13. In 2010-11, it collected Rs 397 crore and repaid Rs 175 crore.
The following year, collections fell significantly to Rs 174 crore, and consequently payments fell drastically to Rs 16 crore; in 2012-13, collection and repayments were reduced to Rs 88 crore and Rs 1.53 lakh respectively.
These four companies had meagre income or revenue, if any, from their declared business activities as specified in their memorandum of association.
Explaining how the scam was constructed, the SFIO goes onto say that these companies could repay the money only from the fresh collections as they were not generating any significant revenue.
Paperwork was created to show the funds collected as having been put together for sale / transfer of land / flats / apartments or tour packages, whereas the intention was always to refund the collected amount with interest on maturity only to some of the depositors and never to refund to the vast majority in the absence of any credible mode of generating a surplus - the characteristics of a pyramid scheme.
During the course of his deposition under oath, Sen also revealed that former West Bengal police chief Rajat Majumdar was appointed as a consultant at a salary of Rs 7 lakh per month.
At Majumdar’s insistence, Saradha agreed to become the prime sponsor of the Bishwa Banga Sammelan 2012 held in Las Vegas in the hope of getting business in the US. Close to Rs 4 crore was blown up on this jaunt.
In a startling revelation, the SFIO points out that Debabrata Sarkar alias Nitu, the de facto secretary of East Bengal Football Club, met Sen and took Rs 5 crore and close to Rs 70 lakh per month (from February 2011 to February 2013) to settle the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) matter. These payments were mostly in cash and if at all in cheque, then in the name of Revlon Commercials with whom Saradha had no trade dealing whatsoever.
While Sen in his statement claimed that this continued for four years (Rs 70 lakh per month is Rs 8.4 crore per year, or Rs 33.6 crore in four years), Debjani claims that this process lasted two years.
“I heard from Sudipta that he was taking money for settlement with SEBI and Reserve Bank of India," she said. (A total amount of approximately Rs 16-18 crore has been made available to Sarkar.)
 
During Sarkar’s questioning, he said that a MoU dated 23.6.2010 was entered into between East Bengal and Saradha for annual sponsorship of the football team at Rs 2 crore per year.
East Bengal, he argued, received cheques totaling Rs 2 crore from Saradha, but some of them were dishonoured. On the follow-up, Saradha paid the club Rs 1.51 crore during 2010-11. While he denied receiving any payments in favour of Revlon, he stated that the club received Rs 1.96 crore and Rs 0.61 crore during 2011-12 and 2012-13 respectively in the form of donations as sponsorship against logo used on the chest of the jersey.
Investigators also examined Kunal Jhunjhunwala, director of Revlon Commercial, who said that Revlon had 16 transactions with Saradha Group companies for sale of textiles.
Total quantum of transaction with Saradha was around Rs 2.46 crore, collecting payment in advance through cheques before delivery.
The SFIO concludes by saying that the role played by this trinity - Debabrata Sarkar, Kunal Jhunjhunwala and Sudipta Sen - should be referred to the Central Bureau of Investigation.

Gold imports: FinMin  RBI to tighten 80:20 scheme on ThursdayImports of the yellow metal surged after the scheme was relaxed in May
New Delhi, November 11:  
The Finance Ministry has called a meeting with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and other departments concerned on Thursday to review the ‘80:20’ scheme for gold imports. The scheme prescribes that any entity importing gold must re-export 20 per cent of it in value-added form.
“Finance & Economic Affairs Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi will chair a meeting on November 13 to review the 80:20 scheme to be attended by key officials from the RBI, Revenue Department and Commerce Ministry. The meeting has been called in the wake of the sudden spurt in gold imports and increase in gems & jewellery exports,” a senior Finance Ministry official told BusinessLine.
The scheme was introduced in July last year to curb gold imports so that the widening current account deficit (CAD) could be checked. CAD is the difference between the payment received and made in dollars. A higher CAD makes the economy vulnerable to higher capital outflow and weakens the rupee.
Though the officials refused to give details, there is a strong possibility of the scheme being tightened, considering the sudden jump in the import of the precious metal. In September, gold imports surged over 400 per cent, taking the trade deficit to an 18-month high.
CAD worries
Since the Government does not want to see the CAD to spin out of control, it wants to take all possible measures in tandem with the RBI. As part of the curbs, the Finance Ministry can revise the import duty on the yellow metal, while as a central banker, the RBI can bring about changes in import or export procedures. Last year the Ministry raised the import duty on gold to 10 per cent.
It is believed that relaxation of the ‘80:20’ scheme in May this year was one reason for the import surge. In May, the RBI allowed star trading houses and premier trading houses (registered as nominated agencies with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade) apart from nominated banks/agencies/entities to import gold under the scheme. It also allowed banks and nominated agencies to provide gold loans for domestic use to jewellers and bullion traders.
RBI had said that the norms had been relaxed to remove hurdles being faced by gems & jewellery exporters and bullion traders.
Exports rise
The September trade data show that export of gems & jewellery turned positive after three successive months of decline. The official said this fact would be kept in mind while reviewing the scheme.

CLSA downgrades BPCL to underperform on Q2 results

(The company’s net profit…)
MUMBAI: Shares of oil marketing company BPCL were witnessing profit booking after CLSA downgraded the stock to 'Underperform' from 'Buy' after second quarter results.
The company's net profit in September quarter fell by about 50 per cent to Rs 464.20 crore from Rs 931.13 crore in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.
According to the management, sharp fall in crude oil prices impacted gross refining margins (GRMs )in second quarter. It expects to see improvement in GRMs in third and fourth quarter.
Average GRMs for half year ended September was $2.36 per barrel.
The company is taking measures to improve non-fuel side of business.
CLSA is of the view that that oil marketing companies no more benefit from falling crude price. The brokerage cautions that these companies may have to bear one-time inventory losses due to declining crude oil prices.
"Recent stock price builds in continuation of supernormal marketing margins and ignores the risks of upcoming competition from private players," the CLSA report said.
"Marketing margin and volumes of OMCs will be at risk as competition from private players ramps up in the auto fuel marketing space in the coming months," it added.
The last minute subsidy reimbursement from government has boosted Q2 earnings, the report says
CLSA has revised its target price upwards to Rs 800 from Rs 675 earlier.
At 12:25 p.m.; the stock was at day's low at Rs 731, down 4.23 per cent, on the BSE. It touched high of Rs 754 intraday.

Use psychology to beat stockpicking prosUse psychology to beat professional stockpickers
By John Authers
Orthodox view on behavioural finance is being turned on its head
Behavioural finance has been talked about, urgently for at least a decade now. Many, perhaps most, professional investors now accept its central insight that flaws in human psychology and perception ensure that markets cannot be as efficient as they were once supposed to be. But until now there has been a persistent complaint. Behavioural finance may be a great idea, but you cannot make any money out of it.
That orthodoxy is now being turned on its head, along with other orthodoxies, by a cheerful career academic from Denver, who took up professional investment management only in his sixties.
More
October’s market jitters are just a taste
Tom Howard, of AthenaInvest, is a finance professor who used to accept modern portfolio theory but was ever more impressed by the literature about behaviouralism, and started to do his own research on active fund managers .
This found, against received wisdom, that most active managers pick stocks well, and that strong performing funds could be identified in advance. Using data on managers’ holdings, Mr Howard could spot the most popular stocks among good managers and pick them in a successful portfolio. He also identified the worst picks of the worst managers, and sold them short, profitably.
As for his own fund, it has been successful. But those interested in investing in it should beware of the following. It has only ten stocks. Mr Howard does not know the names of any of the stocks he holds. And he does not know the price he paid for them.
Concentrated bets
All of this makes more sense on a second examination than it does at first. Mr Howard’s analysis of fund managers involves looking at all their holdings. Past performance is not predictive, but past behaviour does have importance.
This revealed three key traits. First, a manager must show that they have a strategy which is disciplined. Second, that strategy must be followed consistently. Finally, successful managers follow their strategy with high conviction.
That conviction shows itself in a concentrated portfolio. There is little extra diversification in adding more than about ten stocks to a portfolio. Concentrated bets have the best chance to outperform. Such a portfolio will be more volatile, but that is different from being more risky.
Note that this aptly describes Warren Buffett , who calls diversification “di-worsification”. But Mr Howard found other strategies, beyond Mr Buffett’s, that can outperform. The key is to pursue them consistently and with conviction.
These traits are most likely to be found in small and young funds, run by young managers. Once funds grow much above $1bn in assets, and the manager grows older, returns go off the boil. They have a high active share, meaning that they differ significantly from the index.
On Mr Howard’s research, some 80 per cent of active fund managers prove to be good stockpickers. But they are not so good at building portfolios. In general, they will only have a dozen or so truly good ideas, and they come unstuck when they pad out their portfolio, to reach a typical count of 100 stocks.
From 1997 to 2012, the S&P 500 averaged 6.1 per cent per year. Truly active funds managed 8.9 per cent, while a more concentrated portfolio of good managers’ best ideas made 13.9 per cent. Meanwhile, the low-conviction stocks used by poor managers to pad out their portfolios prove terrible picks that should be shorted.
Iron control
Behavioural finance is gaining traction. Mr Howard may even be right that it is emerging as the dominant paradigm, following modern portfolio theory, which held sway from 1974, and before that fundamental investing, inspired by the work of Ben Graham, which emphasised careful analysis of balance sheets.
Behavioural investing is about rigid control of emotions, jettisoning the notion that risk is about volatility, or about the chance of underperforming the benchmark.
But behavioural investing is very difficult. It requires iron control of our emotions. Mr Howard takes this to what many will regard as eccentric lengths by deliberately ignoring the names of the stocks he holds. He builds up a long list, and then sweats it down to a short list without viewing the names of the stocks . This makes him immune to waves of sentiment surrounding the stock.
He also does not record the price at which he buys, because it is irrelevant. This avoids loss aversion, one of the greatest behavioural flaws; the tendency to believe that the difference between -0.5 and +0.5 per cent cent is greater than the difference between +5 and +6 per cent.
His results are great, so far. His fund has gained 66 per cent since inception in 2004, against 38.8 per cent for its benchmark, the Russell 2000.
But to achieve this, he needed such indifference towards the sentiment surrounding his holdings that he could not even remember their names. This may be a great way to make money, but few will find it easy to copy such iron self-control.

US stocks: Dow at record but S&P flat as energy weighsDow
(The Dow industrials closed…)
NEW YORK: The Dow industrials closed at a record high on Thursday, boosted by gains in Wal-Mart, but the S&P 500 was little changed as energy shares tracked crude futures prices lower.
The energy sector cut its losses late in the session after Dow Jones reported Halliburton is in talks to buy Baker Hughes. Halliburton ended up 1 per cent after earlier falling as much as 4.6 per cent, while Baker Hughes rallied to close up 15.3 per cent at $58.75.
They were, however, the only two stocks to finish higher in the energy sector of the S&P 500, which closed down 1.3 per cent. Energy shares fell as Brent crude slid below $78 a barrel while US crude tumbled 3.6 per cent to $74.39, both at their lowest in more than four years.
Wal-Mart closed up 4.7 per cent at $82.94 after posting higher same-store sales for the first time in seven quarters. It earlier hit a high of $83.06.
"Wal-Mart is showing strength, showing the natural relation it should have with (lower) energy prices," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.
Consumer-related companies are expected to see more demand as lower gasoline costs free up cash.
"But while we're waiting for (other) consumer stocks to rise, lower energy prices continue to be a headwind," Hogan said.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.59 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 17,652.79, the S&P 500 gained 1.08 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,039.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.01 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,680.14.
Despite the slight gains, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1,974 to 1,085, for a 1.82-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,800 issues fell and 893 advanced for a 2.02-to-1 ratio.
  Apple rose as high as $113.45 to a fresh record while Microsoft, up 1.7 per cent to $49.61, swelled to a market cap above $408 billion. It overtook Exxon Mobil as the second-largest publicly traded US company, behind Apple.
DreamWorks Animation shares jumped 14.1 per cent to $25.52 after the New York Times said toymaker Hasbro Inc was in talks to buy the Hollywood studio. Hasbro shares lost 4.3 per cent to $54.98.
US-traded BlackBerry shares jumped 7 per cent to $12.06 after it unveiled its new mobile-device management and security platform and struck wide-ranging partnerships.
The S&P 500 posted 67 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 139 new highs and 63 new lows.
Volume on US exchanges hit 6.4 billion, below the month-to-date average of 6.55 billion, according to BATS Global Markets data.

B-School campus placements set to rock; e-commerce & startup industry tops chartsAmazon
(“The students are rooting…)
MUMBAI: Recruiters heading for campus placements will find the batch of 2015 free of the usual jitters. Placement cells of more than 11 top B-schools point out this may be the best placement season in the past few years.
Factors such as bigger pay packets, more job offers and companies waking up from a hiring freeze have resulted in students displaying a larger risk appetite and testing the market for recruitments despite pre-placement offers (PPOs) in hand.
Placement cells of IIM Indore, XLRI, MDI Gurgaon, NMIMS,IIM Calcutta and IIM Lucknow have found students in larger-than-expected groups, wanting to join the e-commerce and startup industry. "E-commerce is the most buzzing sector on campus," says Prabudh Jain, student placement coordinator, MDI, Gurgaon. Agrees Suvarna Athavale, external relations secretary, IIM Calcutta , "E-commerce is growing rapidly in India, and many students are interested especially because of its unique challenges. Students are also expecting to bag more offers than before."
Banking and consulting, the traditional favourities, are still popular on campus, especially when it comes to strategy consulting roles from the likes of McKinsey & Co, BCG, Bain & Co and the like.
An earlier indication of the popularity of ecommerce was revealed during the 'ET Top Recruiters in B-School' survey when, for the first time, e-commerce recruiters such as Flipkart and Amazon joined the top 10 rankings, alongside traditional recruiters such as Cognizant , ICICI Bank and Deloitte, which have consistently been making it to the top 10 over the past few years.
At Mumbai-based NMIMS, the placement team is trying to double the number of startups they got last year to placate one-fourth of the batch who want to join these new-age firms. NMIMS has 450 students to place and had five start-ups hiring from their campus, last year.
"The students are rooting for smaller companies that are below the radar like Salt n Soap, and not just larger ones like Flipkart and Amazon," says the chairperson , placements of one of the top B-schools who does not wish to be named. Students believe opportunities to learn may be more in smaller firms. Besides, the large number of deals in the startup phase has boosted their confidence, adds the chairperson.
Arpit M (name changed), an IIM Bangalore final year student has a PPO like many in his batch. However, most of his classmates, despite their PPOs, will sit for interviews again during final placements. "In any other year, a PPO would have sealed our decision, but those trying their luck this time despite PPOs could be higher," he says.
Student placement committee member, Mahima Sushil of IMI Delhi, says, "It's still early days but we are expecting a good number of first-time recruiters as well." Deferred placements may also increase because more students want to start their own ventures, in an economy that whets the risktaking appetite. Around 20 graduates from the Class of 2014 across the six older IIMs alone had opted out of cushy corporate jobs to launch their own ventures.
Rajiv Mishra, chairperson, placements at XLRI has already seen a couple of students discussing deferred placements. XLRI has 180 students to place. Usually, a few students opt for deferred placements, but this year could see more doing so. B-schools offer deferred placements to top students who want to start their own businesses but in case of a failed attempt, get help from their alma mater for another shot at recruitment.
Indications are that companies may shell out more for their choice of candidates. A placement cell member at one of the newer IIMs, IIM Rohtak, says that freshers are expecting anywhere between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 16 lakh per annum. "This, despite the fact that average work experience for this batch is about 14 months as compared to three years last time. For the batch of 2014, the average salary was at Rs 9.72 lakh," he says. "The season has begun with a bang," says Jain from MDI Gurgaon. "It's still early days, but as compared to last year when the average salary was at Rs 14.74 lakh, we are expecting around or above Rs 16 lakh."
Although students are treading with caution, some positivity from the summers has rubbed off on the students of IIM Bangalore. "During summer placements, firms made more offers and if that happens again during finals, it will change the game," says Sapna Agarwal, head, Career Development Services of IIM Bangalore. Summer placements ended in record time for most B-schools, and many companies across campuses had to be declined.
At XIM, Bhubaneswar, feelers have been sent from IT firms and FMCG companies that had not hired in the past four years, for IT system profile and roles in marketing.
At IIM Lucknow, PE firms and investment banks are returning with more profiles, says Pushpendra Priyadarshi, chairperson, placement. "The batch of 2015 has also shown signs of being selective about their roles and plans to wait for the right offer than accept the first one," says a student placement cell member of IIM Indore.

Eighty US troops sent to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Liberia returned to the United States on Thursday and began a 21-day period of monitored isolation, the Pentagon said.
None of the troops showed symptoms of the deadly disease, a Pentagon statement said.
The men and women landed at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia and were taken to a specially prepared monitoring area, where they will be screened twice a day.
Access to the area is restricted to medical and support personnel, but the troops will be able to contact family and friends by telephone and through social media.
The United States has more than 2,000 troops in Liberia as part of the US Ebola response mission. They were assigned to build up to 17 Ebola treatment units and provide mobile testing labs.

Provident Housing to foray into NCR  Mumbai ...Provident Housing to foray into NCR, Mumbai markets

(The company is currently…)
MUMBAI: Provident Housing, the affordable housing subsidiary of Bengaluru-based Puravankara Projects, plans to foray into bigger property markets including Mumbai, National Capital Region, Pune and Hyderabad in the next one year, a top company executive said.
The company is currently in advanced talks with other developers and land owners in these markets to enter into joint development agreements for undertaking projects totalling over 10 million sq ft. "We will be working on capital-lite joint development model. In the long run, we will be a pan-India developer of affordable housing, which is the most in-demand and under-serviced segment," said Jackbastian Nazareth, group CEO, Puravankara Projects. "For now, we will be focusing on these new cities and our existing markets in the next 3-5 years." In Hyderabad, Provident Housing and its partner have already sought civic approvals for a 2.2 million sq ft development.
In Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the company is in talks for a project that will have total development of a little less than a million sq ft, while in Pune it is in talks for two projects, he said. The company is currently developing projects spread over 9.38 million sq ft comprising total 9,048 units, while it has already delivered 4,430 units spread over 4.55 million sq ft so far.
"Out of our seven ongoing projects, four are through joint development agreement with landlords. This works better in managing cost as we enter as development manager , while the landlord brings land parcels as his/her equity participation," Nazareth said.
In 2008, Puravankara Projects launched wholly-owned subsidiary Provident Housing to exclusively focus on affordable housing projects. The company has four major projects in Bengaluru and has also ventured in other markets in southern India like Chennai, Coimbatore and Mangalore in the last six years since its inception.
Provident Housing was among the first property developers to focus on affordable housing. In order to reduce its construction cost, the company incorporated precast technology wherein panels or units are manufactured at site and assembled.
"Contrary to general perception that affordable housing is mere volume game, we have enjoyed operating margins of around 35% due to precast construction technology and other efficiency measures," Nazareth said. "However, now the operating margins stand slightly reduced at around 25-30% due to rising raw material cost."

Chinese students shunning an outdated education systemChina’s university system faces criticism for being unfit for a modern economy
By Patti Waldmeir
©Reuters
Parents of students newly arrived at university in Wuhan sleep on the floor of a gymnasium on the campus as they help their children settle into university life
Every year at this time, thousands of parents sleep on the floor of university gymnasiums throughout China, eager to help their precious only child secure what for many is the family’s chief asset: a degree from a Chinese university.
But in recent years that certificate has lost its lustre: hundreds of thousands of Chinese families have voted with their tuition dollars to avoid the domestic university system and send their child overseas to study . The flight from Chinese universities has accelerated to the point where nearly one in three international students in the US is now Chinese (a total of 287,000). And education experts back home say the deficiencies of the local university system – from excessive bureaucracy to poor-quality teaching, from corruption to lack of academic freedom – are largely to blame.

How universities use architecture to market themselves
The difficulty in navigating these choices was highlighted in early September when three of China’s leading universities responded to a call from President Xi Jinping to intensify “ideological education” in China. The Chinese Communist party committee of Fudan University, one of the mainland’s most prestigious, published a commentary in the official press saying: “It is an extremely important political mission of the party committees at universities to guide middle-aged and young teachers who lived overseas for many years – and are tempted to compare the developmental levels overseas with ours, who have only an obscure knowledge of the social system, development path and values of our country – to overcome their shortages and grow in a healthy way.”
For centuries, when much of the world was sunk in the dark ages, China boasted one of the world’s most advanced education systems. From the seventh century until the early 20th, its renowned “imperial examinations” controlled entrance to the ranks of the Emperor’s civil service; scholars spent years preparing for them. But Mao Zedong’s cultural revolution, which targeted universities along with other symbols of privilege, hobbled higher education in China for a decade. By the time universities resumed normal admissions in the late 1970s, only about a quarter of a million students were enrolled for university study each year – out of a total mainland population of nearly 1bn. Since then, university admissions have exploded: by 2012, the latest year for which figures are available, China was turning out nearly 7m graduates a year, or three-quarters of those who sat the college entrance exam, known as the gaokao, compared with fewer than 5 per cent of those who sat the exam in 1977. The goal is to educate 40 per cent of those of university age by 2020. According to the ministry of education, 34.5 per cent of that age group were in higher education in 2013.

But numbers are not everything – local education experts criticise the domestic university system for failing to turn out the kind of creative thinkers on which the increasingly innovative society depends for future growth. “The kids who have the best memory and ability to conform to the system succeed, but their number one quality is an ability to take orders and be micromanaged,” says Jiang Xueqin, education consultant. “That kind of student is easy to manage at junior levels, but at senior levels they have never learned the things that allow them to be good managers,” he says, echoing complaints often heard from multinational employers in China.
Beijing is aware of the problem and has adopted a decade-long plan to reform the university system – and the much-hated gaokao. But at almost the mid point of the plan period, which covers the years 2010-20, not much has been achieved, education experts say. Parents and children, increasingly exposed to overseas education systems through travel, are less and less willing to submit to the rigours of the current system, which relies on years of rote learning and memorisation to pass an exam whose relevance is increasingly coming into question.
The number of students taking the gaokao has declined from a high of 10.1m in 2007 to 9.4m last year, partly because it requires at least a year of near round-the-clock study, sometimes with the support of a parent who must give up their job to ensure the test taker can devote every waking moment to hitting the books. Only those earning the best scores can gain entrance to China’s top universities; the rest are left in mediocre provincial institutions or studying subjects not of their choice. “The problem with Chinese higher education is that universities in China are run by the government. They are overly bureaucratic and have no autonomy,” says Xiong Bingqi, vice-president of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing. “You end up with 1,000 universities that are all alike – and they focus too much on scale and not enough on quality,” he says.
The reform plan calls for administrative power to be devolved from central government level – heads of 31 top Chinese universities have a civil service rank equivalent to deputy minister in the current system – to local government and then to the university itself. Schools would also be given more autonomy in choosing students, and students in choosing schools, and there would be a relaxation of the ultra-rigid gaokao. Some autonomy is built into the current system: bonus points are awarded to those participating in some sports and international competitions, to minorities and even sometimes to rural females (to help redress a gender imbalance in rural society). Extra “morality points” are also available.

Undercover tricks: equipment used by students to cheat, and confiscated by the authorities
But giving universities more power over the admissions process can lead to problems. Late last year, the head of admissions for China’s prestigious Renmin University was detained for selling university seats.
Last month the ministry of education tightened up the criteria for bonus points, reducing the number of sports for which extra points are awarded from 70 to 17.
Frustration with the system led in 2007 to the establishment of a revolutionary new university, the South University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, which initially tried admitting students without requiring them to take the gaokao. But within a few years it had capitulated to pressure from central government, using gaokao scores as the main criterion for choosing students. The reformist head of the university was also replaced by a government appointee. “The experiment at the South University of Science and Technology has failed,” says Xiong of the 21st Century Education Research Institute. “Their ideals were inevitably consumed by reality.” Overall, little of the ambitious national reform plan has been implemented. “University heads are still appointed by government and have administrative ranks, and there is still no clear path agreed to reform the gaokao,” says Xiong.
The problem is… universities in China are run by the government. They are overly bureaucratic and have no autonomy
“Some Chinese people were at first very optimistic about the education reforms. But now the reality that the reforms are hard to pursue has disappointed them,” he says. “Therefore, more and more choose to send their kids to study abroad.”
So these days, Chinese parents are faced with the choice of forcing their child to endure the ordeal of the gaokao to grab one of the few seats at a top local university or saving and sacrificing even more to send their only child overseas to study. And no one is predicting that students will stop fleeing the Chinese educational system anytime soon.

Amazon  Hachette end monthslong dispute...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — One of publishing's nastiest, most high-profile conflicts, the monthslong standoff between Amazon.com and Hachette Book Group, is ending.
Amazon and Hachette announced a multiyear agreement Thursday. With e-book revenues reportedly the key issue, Amazon had removed pre-order tags for Hachette books, reduced discounts and slowed deliveries, hurdles that should be gone well before the crucial holiday shopping season.
"This is great news for writers," Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch said in a statement. "The new agreement will benefit Hachette authors for years to come. It gives Hachette enormous marketing capability with one of our most important bookselling partners."
David Naggar, an Amazon vice president, said the company was pleased that the deal "includes specific financial incentives for Hachette to deliver lower prices, which we believe will be a great win for readers and authors alike."
The agreement takes effect early next year. Restrictions on Hachette books are being lifted immediately, according to the announcement, although delays on Carlos Santana's "The Universal Tone," J.D. Salinger's "Nine Stories" and other works remained in place several hours after the news broke.
The Amazon-Hachette dispute had filled publishing headlines and conversations for much of the year, extending to debates over the power of Amazon and the viability of traditional publishing. James Patterson, John Green and hundreds of authors from various publishers had condemned Amazon, and Hachette author Stephen Colbert mocked the online retailer, which prides itself on customer service.
Meanwhile, Hugh Howey, J.A. Konrath and other writers published by Amazon had blamed Hachette and praised Amazon for keeping prices down and allowing authors unhappy with traditional publishers to release their work elsewhere.
Neither side seemed to benefit.
Later Thursday, Hachette's corporate parent, Lagardere, issued an earnings report showing an 18.5 percent sales decline for Hachette in the third quarter and blaming "punitive measures" by Amazon for a drop in the U.S. market share of e-books for adult trade releases.
Amazon, the country's leading bookseller and dominant e-book seller, issued a disappointing earnings report last month, although the impact of Hachette books was unclear.
Douglas Preston, a Hachette writer who had organized a public campaign against Amazon, wrote in an email Thursday that he was relieved by the news and hoped that "if disagreements arise in the future between Amazon and publishers, Amazon will never again seek to gain leverage by sanctioning books and hurting authors."
Howey called Thursday's announcement "great news" and wrote in an email that he was "glad Hachette stopped this crazy campaign which only hurt itself and its authors."
Hachette was among five publishers sued in 2012 by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly fixing e-book prices. The publishers, who had worried that Amazon was charging too little for e-books, settled and were required to negotiate new deals with Amazon and other retailers.
Under the new agreement, Hachette will set prices for e-books, "and will also benefit from better terms when it delivers lower prices for readers."
Amazon last month reached a multiyear deal with Simon & Schuster, another publisher that was sued in 2012 and eventually settled. Like Hachette, Simon & Schuster will set e-book prices, a top priority for publishers. The terms also included a priority for Amazon: "financial incentive for Simon & Schuster to deliver lower prices for readers."
Precise numbers were not announced for the Hachette or Simon & Schuster deals, but Howey noted in his email Thursday that for authors who self-publish through Amazon, the retailer takes a higher percentage of revenues when e-books are above a certain price.
Thursday's news raised expectations that agreements with the remaining major New York publishers, HarperCollins, Macmillan and Penguin Random House, can be achieved without disruption.
But with the Amazon-Hachette conflict resolved, more long-lasting tensions may return. The Authors Guild, which represents hundreds of published writers, had strongly supported Hachette and welcomed Thursday's news. But Guild president Roxana Robinson also pointed out in a statement that in light of authors' loyalty to Hachette "throughout this debacle," publishers should consider raising "the standard e-book royalty rate of 25 percent," an issue that has led some writers to sell their e-books through Amazon and others who offer higher rates.

Uber plans to set up national level ops in I...Africa
(“We’re a start-up but…)
NEW DELHI: Taxi-hailing app Uber plans to set up national level operations in India, a shift from its typical model operated across different countries where a skeletal workforce operates city-centric business, even as it expands its footprint into new cities in its largest and fastest growing market outside the US.
The popular app, which introduced a mobile wallet for cashless payments on Wednesday, now plans to add a managerial layer on top of its existing operations in 10 cities where it offers high quality taxi rides, while it plans to hire hundreds of people on city-level operations across the country.
"We're a start-up but increasingly as the number of cities grow, there is so much that our teams in each market are working on," Allen Penn, head of Asia operations at Uber, told ET. "It makes sense to add some extra levels, so that the core remains at the city-level where the action is," he said, while adding that Uber will be looking to hire strategic finance managers and community operations managers who would oversee city operations across India, which is growing at 40% month-on-month. "We want to make sure that India retains that crown."
At present, San Francisco-headquartered Uber principally follows a set up on a city-basis, where a general manager runs each city, a community manager looks after marketing and an operations manager looks after supply side and operations. Though Uber will stick to its model of using minimum staff, the new staff layer will be another first for the taxi-provider, which started off by launching a vehicle financing programme in India, which has the most employees outside the US. It followed up with a first of its kind tie-up with mobile wallet provider Paytm, using which Uber users in India can make payments via netbanking, debit cards and credit cards.
"We will be hiring several hundred people over the next year in India, incredibly fast here to staff up our city teams," Penn added. Product customisations, which have started out from India, will be done in other fast growing, high potential markets in South East Asia, Africa , West Asia and Latin America.
ET reported on Wednesday that Uber plans to invest $400 million in India. Penn did not comment on the quantum of investment but said that the company's India business will see heavy capital getting invested across sections. "Increasingly, you're going to see our investment, which means everything from capital, people, technology and product, to flow to international markets where we see very high growth and potential. India sits on the top of that list," he said.

Apple Faces Lawsuit Over Vanishing Text MessagesApple Faces Lawsuit Over Vanishing Text Messages
Reuters
By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Apple Inc
was ordered to face a U.S. federal lawsuit claiming it failed to tell consumers that its messaging system would block them from receiving text messages if they switched to Android-based smartphones from iPhones.
U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California said Apple must face plaintiff Adrienne Moore's claim that the message blocking interfered with her contract with Verizon Wireless
for wireless service, which she kept after switching in April to a Samsung <005930.KS> Galaxy S5 from an iPhone 4.
Moore, who seeks class-action status and unspecified damages, claimed that Apple failed to disclose how its iOS 5 software operating system would obstruct the delivery of "countless" messages from other Apple device users if iPhone users switched to non-Apple devices.
In a Monday night decision, Koh said Moore deserved a chance to show Apple disrupted her wireless service contract and violated a California unfair competition law, by blocking messages meant for her.
"Plaintiff does not have to allege an absolute right to receive every text message in order to allege that Apple's intentional acts have caused an actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship," Koh wrote.
The judge also dismissed some claims tied to another California consumer protection law.
Apple did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. Roy Katriel, a lawyer for Moore, did not immediately respond to similar requests.
In court papers, Apple said it never claimed that its iMessage service and Messages application, which ran with iOS 5, would recognize when iPhone users switched to rival devices.
"Apple takes customer satisfaction extremely seriously, but the law does not provide a remedy when, as here, technology simply does not function as plaintiff subjectively believes it should," the Cupertino, California-based company said.
For its fiscal year ended Sept. 27, Apple reported sales of 169.2 million iPhones.
Apple now has an online tool to help people who switch to non-Apple smartphones retrieve messages from iPhone users.
The case is Moore et al v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 14-02269.

TESTIFYING HISTORY: The 800-year-old inscription found at Poigaikaraipatti Temple tank.

Inscriptions found at Poigaikaraipatti near Alagar Koil record the existence of a rich green environment.
Poigaikaraipatti, a small hamlet at the foothills of Alagar koil woke up to its long forgotten history last Sunday, when archaeologists and history enthusiasts deciphered age-old inscriptions found around the famous temple tank situated at the heart of the village. The tank which has a perimeter of two kilometres contains a quaint little mandapam standing in the centre. A flight of stone steps lead to the muddy water collected inside the square-shaped structure constructed during the Vijayanagara reign. With the majestic Alagar hill, the feeding source to the tank, forming a green backdrop to the setting, the sight is to behold.
Every February, during the Masi Thiruvizha, Lord Kallazhagar is brought down to the Poigaikaraipatti tank for the float festival. “Float festivals were popularised by the Nayak kings. Earlier, the tank must have been a poigai (small natural pond), from which the village gets its name,” observes Dr. V. Vedachalam, retd., Archaeological Officer, who recently discovered an 800-year-old inscription on the southern bank of the tank. The stone inscription belonging to the later-Pandya period talks about the existence of a beautiful garden with flowering plants surrounding the water body. It refers to one Manjakudaiyan Uyyavandan Thirunoku Alagiyan Thondaiman from Pudukottai who designed the garden. “Three more inscriptions were found earlier on the other sides of the tank. They state that there were gardens on all sides of the tank and were donated by different people from various kingdoms,” says Vedachalam. Today, except a few Banyan trees, the banks of the tank are glaringly dry and bare.
History lovers state that the idea behind construction of temple tanks was also to save water and nurture environment apart from religious purposes. “Since Alagar koil has thick forests and received good rainfall, the Vijayanagara kings must have modified what was once a natural pond into an elaborate temple tank,” says Vedachalam, noting that the tank resembles the Vandiyur Teppakulam in the design and structure. However, villagers of Poigaikaraipatti rue the encroachment and blockage of channels that lead rain water from the hill to the tank.
Members of DHAN Foundation which organised the Heritage walk in association with INTACH and Madurai Travel Club came forward to develop gardens around the tank with the help of the villagers. “We will assist the village panchayat in all ways to bring back water from the hill and to redevelop the lost gardens,” says Vasimalai, executive director of DHAN Foundation. “Also to make the villagers aware of the historical importance, we will be coming out with a small handbook with pictures that can be introduced as learning material at the middle school in the village.”
Poigaikaraipatti also has another part of history hidden inside a private farmland. A three-foot long stone inscription belonging to the time of later-Pandya king Maravarman Sundarapandian dating to 1307 A.D. is found half-buried at a maize field. The Tamil inscription refers to a meeting held by the Kammalas who lived in one part of the village called as ‘Pavithra Manickapuram’. It further hails one Vembitrur Sundarathol Nambi who guarded the village. “The region around Alagar koil is mentioned as ‘Keezh Iranyapuram’ in historical inscriptions. It’s said that the Sangam age poet Perungundranar belongs to the area,” adds Vedachalam.
During the walk, Vedachalam also demonstrated how to take paper-ink impressions of stone inscriptions without damaging the structure. He also deciphered the letters written in old Tamil font. “Though the first line ‘Swasthi Sri’ is inscribed in Grantha script, the rest are in Tamil,” he says. “All the four inscriptions found around the tank have the motif of ‘poorna kumbham’ as a symbol of auspiciousness.”

Ex-CEO of mine that blew up  killing 29  indicted...and
versions
CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Don Blankenship, the steely-eyed executive once dubbed "The Dark Lord of Coal Country," on Thursday became the highest-ranking coal official to face federal charges in the nation's deadliest mine disaster in 40 years.
A federal grand jury indicted the former Massey Energy CEO on numerous counts of conspiracy in the April 2010 underground explosion that killed 29 men at the Upper Big Branch Mine in Montcoal, West Virginia.
The 43-page indictment said Blankenship "knew that UBB was committing hundreds of safety-law violations every year and that he had the ability to prevent most of the violations that UBB was committing. Yet he fostered and participated in an understanding that perpetuated UBB's practice of routine safety violations, in order to produce more coal, avoid the costs of following safety laws, and make more money."
His attorney, William W. Taylor III, said in a statement that Blankenship "is entirely innocent of these charges. He will fight them and he will be acquitted."
"Don Blankenship has been a tireless advocate for mine safety," the statement said. "His outspoken criticism of powerful bureaucrats has earned this indictment. He will not yield to their effort to silence him. He will not be intimidated."
But Pam Napper, whose son, Josh Napper, was among the miners who died that day, said "it's about time" Blankenship was called to account.
"He was a big part of this," she said. "He knew what was going on in that mine and continued to let it go. I hope he gets what he deserves. I am so excited. They aren't sad tears today. They're happy tears."
Earlier this year, Blankenship sponsored and appeared in a 50-minute documentary titled "Upper Big Branch — Never Again." In it, he argued that regulators never got to the truth about what happened underground.
"If someone wants to know the truth about what happened at UBB, they need to go ubbneveragain.com and watch the documentary," Blankenship, in his signature even baritone, told MSNBC's Chris Hayes early last month.
But U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said the truth is contained in the indictment.
In February 2013, a former longtime subordinate, David Hughart, testified that Blankenship ordered the widespread corporate practice of warning coal miners about surprise federal inspections. The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause of the blast was Massey's "systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts" to conceal life-threatening problems. MSHA said managers even maintained two sets of pre-shift inspection books - an accurate one for themselves, and a sanitized one for regulators.
The indictment says Blankenship conspired to violate standards at the mine from January 2008 until April 2010, when the explosion tore through the tunnels.
The explosion prompted federal officials to begin monthly "impact" inspections at problem mines throughout Appalachia in addition to routine state and federal visits. MSHA said last month that it has conducted 823 "impact" inspections sites and issued more than 13,000 citations since the explosion.
Alpha Natural Resources bought Massey for $7.1 billion in June 2012. Blankenship retired ahead of the merger.
"We can only hope that the outcome of the upcoming proceedings that were announced today will provide some level of comfort and closure for the families of the fallen miners and to the larger community where we live and operate," Alpha said in a statement.
Four investigations into the disaster found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of coal dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno.
Blankenship started a blog to push his assertion that the presence of natural gas in the mine, and not methane gas and excess coal dust, was at the root of the explosion. He said getting to that "truth" was "the best way to honor the victims of Upper Big Branch ..."
In the November 2010 Rolling Stone article in which the "dark lord" moniker was coined, Jeff Goodell described the former $18 million-a-year man as "the undisputed king of coal in West Virginia."
"Other Big Coal CEOs who operate in Appalachia are business-school types who have offices in other states and leave the dirty work to their minions," he wrote. "Blankenship, by contrast, is a rich hillbilly who believes that God put coal in the ground so that he could mine it, and anyone — or any law — that stands in his way needs to be beaten down, bought off or tied up in court.
"Blankenship is hated, feared and respected, but nobody wants to tangle with him."
Until now. If convicted, Blankenship could face up to 31 years in prison.
Others have been convicted in the case. Former White Buck Coal Co. President Hughart, who testified that Blankenship ordered the inspection warnings, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges. Hughart, who never worked at Upper Big Branch, was eventually sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for his role.
Former UBB superintendent Gary May was sentenced last year to one year and nine months in prison on charges he defrauded the government through his actions at the mine, including disabling a methane gas monitor and falsifying records. May cooperated with prosecutors.
He testified at the February 2012 sentencing of former Massey security chief Hughie Elbert Stover, who was sent to prison for three years for lying to investigators and ordering a subordinate to destroy documents. It was one of the stiffest punishments ever handed down in a mine safety case.

Leonardo Dicaprio: Let s Not Wait Until We Pass More Tipping Pointsreddit
Around 250 million years ago most life was extinguished from our planet in a cataclysmic extinction event. Today, it could happen again.
That's the story Leonard DiCaprio tells in Last Hours, another installment of a four-part climate change documentary series directed by Leila Conners, the director of the 11th Hour film.
"Consider this," DiCaprio states at the start of the film, "Nearly all life on Earth could go extinct because of manmade climate change."
The film then takes us back to the Permian Mass Extinction 250 million years ago, an extinction event that wiped out 95% of all life on the planet. Scientists, many of whom appear in the film, are just beginning to understand what caused the Permian extinction, and it's very bad news: that wipeout of life on Earth was caused by rapid global warming.
As the film explains, science shows that massive volcanic eruptions near Siberia released enormous amounts of greenhouse gasses, sending the planet into a warming spiral. As temperatures increased, more potent greenhouse gasses like methane that had been locked away in ice under the sea for hundreds of millions of years melted and bubbled up into the air as well, pushing us past a tipping point into irreversible and catastrophic global warming.
Last Hours argues this may be happening again.
Modern society's addiction to burning fossil fuels is releasing large amounts of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere in much the same way as were released during the volcanic eruptions of the Permian extinction. These gasses during the Permian then warmed the oceans, leading to releases of methane that spiked global warming.
Dr. Michael Benton with the University of Bristol explains in the film, "Looking at these ancient events shows us times of global warming and the atmosphere doesn't care whether the carbon dioxide comes from human activity or from a volcano. It has the same end effect."
Climate change is too often talked about in terms of dollars and cents. But as Last Hours argues, it must be talked about in terms of human survival. The film paints an alarming picture of the future if humans don't respond by reducing carbon emissions today.
In a call to action at the end of the film, DiCaprio states, "The world community must come together, step forward, and take decisive action." He goes on to call for "the largest movement in human history" to respond to climate change.
"It could mean our very survival," DiCaprio says.
Last Hours is a warning that tells us all just how high the stakes are on a planet with rapidly increasing temperatures.

Judge sticks to BP gross negligence ruling...and
versions
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A federal judge in New Orleans is sticking to his ruling that said BP's conduct in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil rig disaster amounted to "gross negligence."
It could mean close to $18 billion in federal penalties for the oil giant.
U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier on Thursday rejected BP's call to either amend his Sept. 4 judgment or hold a new trial on the issue.
BP attorneys filed a motion in October arguing that a key finding that led to the "gross negligence" ruling was based on testimony about cement used to seal the completed Macondo before the April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. BP asserted that the testimony from Gene Beck, an expert for cement contractor Halliburton, had been excluded from a trial on the issue.
"Initially, it requires some effort to identify exactly what testimony is the target of BP's motion," Barbier wrote in an 11-page ruling that included excerpts from the testimony. He said some testimony was excluded. However, he said, some critical testimony was elicited by BP's attorneys on cross examination.
"Even assuming that the complained-of testimony was excluded during direct examination, BP's own counsel later opened the door to this testimony," Barbier wrote.
Barbier said there was no basis for BP's claim that the testimony was unfair or prejudicial. BP did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20, 2010, killing 11 workers and spewing millions of gallons into the Gulf of Mexico for months. BP leased the rig from Transocean Ltd.
Barbier has scheduled a January trial to determine how much in Clean Water Act fines BP will face.
Under the Clean Water Act, a polluter can be forced to pay a maximum of either $1,100 or $4,300 per barrel of spilled oil. The higher limit applies if the company is found grossly negligent — as BP was in Barbier's ruling. But penalties can be assessed at lower amounts.
Government experts estimated that 4.2 million barrels spilled into the Gulf. BP urged Barbier to use an estimate of 2.45 million barrels in calculating any Clean Water Act penalties.

Virgin America says its initial public offering of 13.3 million shares has priced at $23 apiece.
The offering values the Burlingame, California, airline at about $994 million and was priced below the top of the expected range of $21 to $24 a share. The carrier is selling 13.1 million shares and shareholders are offering the rest.
Virgin America, backed by Richard Branson, says its shares will start trading Friday on the Nasdaq stock market under the ticker symbol "VA."
Virgin America started flying in 2007 with the goal of being low-cost but high-flair. Its Airbus jets feature mood lighting, leather seats and seatback touch screens for watching TV, ordering drinks or chatting with passengers in other rows.

Tariff-based bids may make debut in airport operations
Mihir Mishra, ET Bureau Nov 14, 2014, 04.14AM IST
(The move is aimed at curbing…)
NEW DELHI: In an attempt to protect consumers and airlines from escalating prices at private airports, the Ministry of Civil Aviation may, for the first time, seek tariff-based bids from companies seeking to operate airfields at Jaipur and Ahmedabad.
Bidders quoting the lowest tariff would win the projects, two government officials said. The move is aimed at curbing sharp increases in charges at airports after they are privatised, as seen in some cases that were awarded on a revenue sharing basis. "The model is being discussed...the cost that the prospective airport operator would incur in terms of expansion or construction would be known to the bidder beforehand. Airports Authority of India would either ask for a one-time charge for using the infrastructure or lease rentals... Modalities are being discussed," explained a senior AAI official, who did not want to be identified.
Analysts feel the fixed-tariff model isn't appropriate for sectors such as aviation. Such bidding is possible in sectors that are mature and where traffic and costs can be reasonably predicted, they said, adding this model has failed even in road and metro rail projects, with bidders chickening out once they realise that traffic and costs are beyond what they had predicted.
"In a volatile world of aviation wherein passenger traffic, fuel prices, dollar exchange rate, interest rate, price of airport equipment and construction material cannot be predicted even for the next 12 months, expecting bidders to bid at a fixed tariff for a period of 30 long years sounds impractical," said Amber Dubey, Partner and India Head of Aerospace and Defence at global consultancy KPMG. In most developed economies in the US and the European Union, airport tariffs are kept flexible and are adjusted periodically to make it fair to passengers and developers.
In Australia, airports fix their own tariffs while the regulator keeps an eye from a distance, Dubey said.
An airline body said bidding on tariffs would bring relief for passengers and airlines. "This would be a good move as it would bring respite from high charges at private airports. However, the government should ensure that the charges keep falling every year," said an airline body representative.
High charges at Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru airports have been criticised by airlines and passenger bodies. The ministry has received complaints from them about higher charges at private airports.
In one of the representations, an airline body said the cost of turning around a jet (a short-haul Airbus 320 or Boeing 737) is about $6,000 at an Indian private airport, whereas it costs $2,300 at Singapore's Changi airport. The civil aviation ministry plans to award the airports at Jaipur and Ahmedabad on a publicprivate partnership. Charges at all major airports, are decided by the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority.

Decoding India s consent to an indefinite  p...November 14, 2014, 2:25 am IST Economic Times in ET Commentary | Economy , Finance | ET

By Dr Biswajit Dhar
NEW DELHI: After months of impasse, India finally agreed to relent on its opposition to allow progress on the post-Bali work programme of the World Trade Organization (WTO), after concluding a “bilateral agreement” with the United States. According to the terms of the agreement, a mechanism will be in place under which WTO Members will not challenge India’s food security programmes under WTO dispute settlement procedures until a “permanent solution” regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted. In other words, India has agreed to an indefinite “peace clause”. The agreement further adds that elements for an intensified programme of work and negotiations to arrive at such a permanent solution would be set out. This deal will clear the decks for the adoption of the agreement on trade facilitation, which, as per the time-table agreed to at the end of the Bali Ministerial Conference, was to come into effect on July 31 of this year.
This “bilateral agreement” to break the logjam that the multilateral trading system has been facing for the past several months raises at least two sets of issues. First, is this manner of doing deals in conformity with the spirit of multilateralism, where decisions are to be taken collectively by countries? The agreement also points to the fact that the United States continues to have the whip hand over the WTO, which can broker critical deals without the members of the organization having participated in the process. In short, the deal may not have set the most ideal precedence for the multilateral trading system.
The second and the more important issue is the outcome of this deal for India. In the discussions on this issue thus far, India has made it clear that it was looking for a permanent solution to the problem that the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) could create for the country’s ambitious food security programme. The AoA requires that when a WTO member undertakes public stockholding for food security purposes, the difference between the prices at which the foodgrains are acquired (the minimum support price, in India’s case) and the average of the international prices prevailing during 1986-88 must be counted as subsidies. Further, this Agreement allows developing countries to grant agricultural subsidies only up to 10% of their value of agricultural production. India’s concern is that if this threshold is breached; the domestic food security programme could be in jeopardy. Since the current acquisition prices have to be set against an historical set of international prices, namely 1986-88, India, along with the G-33 countries (a group that currently has 46 countries), has argued that this inherent anomaly for the calculation of subsidies needs to be corrected, which is the essence of the “permanent solution”.
Now that the deal has been done to introduce an indefinite “peace clause”, the question that arises is whether the discussions on the permanent solution would also drag on indefinitely.
The “peace clause” does not come without conditions. The Bali Decision on public stockholding requires that countries using this facility should “have provided, and continue to provide on an annual basis … information… for each public stockholding programme that it maintains for food security purposes”. Additional information, including those related to the management of food security stocks and the number of beneficiaries would have to be provided “as soon as possible after it becomes available”. Thus, India’s food security programme would be strictly monitored by the WTO: whether this organization has the right to question the sovereign right of a country to feed its poor is therefore the moot point.

 Government to Review Gold Policy After Imports SurgeGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi/Mumbai: Government is considering curbs on gold imports by private trading firms after foreign purchases surged in the past two months, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
October shipments into India, the world's No.2 gold consumer after China, jumped to about 150 tonnes, compared with under 25 tonnes a year earlier and 143 tonnes in September, a third source, a top finance ministry official, said on Thursday.
All three sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Measures under discussion would restrict imports by private trading firms, which started importing gold around the middle of this year after being barred from doing so from July 2013, the first two sources said.
Officials from the Indian central bank and finance ministry are meeting on Thursday to discuss the policy, local media and Bloomberg have reported.
The October jump follows a 450 per cent surge in September imports to $3.75 billion that weighed on the country's trade deficit, sparking fears that the government could tighten the screws again on gold.
Any new restrictions could increase local premiums to the global benchmark and hurt consumer demand.
Reduced Indian gold buying would also pressure global prices, already smarting from weakening demand in China.
Struggling with a high trade deficit, India last year raised its gold import duty to a record 10 percent and made it mandatory to export a fifth of all bullion imports.
The moves crimped supply, boosted local premiums and encouraged smuggling.
Earlier this year, India eased some of those rules by allowing private agencies to import gold. Imports have since been higher than last year's low levels.
India's gold imports are typically strong in the second half of the year as banks and retailers stock up for major festivals such as Dhanteras and Diwali, when it is considered auspicious to buy gold. The ongoing wedding season is also boosting consumer demand.
India's appetite for gold jumped by more than a third to 225.1 tonnes in the July-Sept quarter, in sharp contrast to the rest of the world, boosted by jewellery demand, the World Gold Council said on Thursday.
"Given the recent seasonality, it would be advisable to wait for another month or two of gold import data before re-imposing any restrictions," Nomura analysts said in a note on Thursday.
"There has been some increase in underlying gold demand as well, but we do not expect this to be sustained."

The ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are also discussing tightening limits on gold imports by trading houses, two other sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The Top 5 Reasons Employees Quitreddit
It is essential to hire, develop and retain top talent to ensure your business stays innovative, efficient, successful and long lasting. Losing top talent can affect a company's morale, leave a skill deficit, and place a burden on the remaining employees to pick up the slack. Turnover is also a burden because employers must dedicate resources to finding replacement personnel to ensure productivity and service quality levels remain high.
Despite popular belief, employees actually value loyalty to their employer. They shun the idea of job hunting and looking for another business to join every 5 - 7 years. Employees want to be on a winning team whose growth and development can provide them with new skills and opportunities for professional advancement.
As a business psychologist and HR consultant that assists businesses with recruitment, development and retention of their top talent, I often ask their job candidates why are they leaving their current employer for our open position. Many, if not most of the reasons shared, usually fall within the same 5 categories. Below are the top 5 reasons employees express why they are leaving their current employer and what business owners can implement to retain their top talent.
1. They don't feel appreciated
Companies lose sight of their employees' value. They maintain a Theory X mindset that an employee should be lucky to have a job, especially in this economy, and are easily replaceable.  Employees express good fortune at being employed, but they also express a desire to belong to an organization that cares about their well being. When employees feel they are only padding the pocket of their employer and their basic Maslow needs of belonging and esteem aren't being met, they are prime to quit. Simple strategies such as employee appreciation days, handwritten notes to thank them for their effort and work and demonstrating care towards employees can go a long way to keeping them around for the long haul.
2. They aren't innovating
Companies that have exited the start-up phase remain stagnant in their development of new ideas. Businesses must remember employees like being part of a winning team where they can leave an indelible mark. Businesses cannot forget to be innovative, launch new products and services, develop a pipeline of new contracts and groom current employees to participate in these new endeavors, if they want to remain competitive, both in the marketplace and in recruiting. As these opportunities come to fruition, businesses should talk with their employees to learn about how they can contribute to these new opportunities and provide them with training to work in these new, exciting arenas.
3. They aren't properly trained
Employees want to be set-up for success and not failure. They recognize that with all new positions they must demonstrate the willingness to be a self-starter, go-getter and quick learner. Improperly or untrained employees express frustration that their employers overly rely on them being a quick-learner and don't provide them with enough training, mentorship or plain guidance and direction to be successful on the job. A lack of training often results in unnecessary errors, reprimands and low employee morale. When an employee regularly feels defeated, they are prime for voluntarily exiting the company to find an employer who will take the time to train them to do their job and do it well. Businesses must set-aside time to properly train their employees, partner them up with senior employees who can walk them through the ins and outs of the job, and give the employee continuous guidance and feedback to improve their performance, ensure their success and the company's success.
4. They feel like they're in a toxic work environment
Employees leave when they perceive their work environment as an unhealthy one. Managers and employees must learn how their words and actions can set the tone for an unhealthy workplace, how to determine whether their department is on the verge of toxicity and how to implement techniques to boost morale and foster a healthy workplace. By giving managers the tools and skills to effectively communicate, coach and motivate their team, they will be better equipped to manage conflicts, and collaborate and influence others, thus reducing employee turnover.
5. They don't have work-life balance
Employees dislike when work bleeds into their personal time. In fact, in the U.S. approximately 40% of all workers today feel overworked, pressured and squeezed to the point of anxiety, depression and disease, and 63% of Americans report they are not coping effectively with stress. When workers feel there is no balance between work and home, and they are always on call miss out on touching moments in their family members life, they will likely quit regardless of financial compensation. Business owners who overly rely on employees should consider hiring another employee even on a part-time basis so they don't invoke employee burnout. Companies can also provide and insist that employees take vacation time to refresh and recuperate, protect employees personal time by not calling or asking them to work on their days off, and sticking to the work schedule and responsibilities originally defined in the job interview.
Businesses that take the time to reflect as to whether they are creating circumstances that contribute to employee turnover can increase the likelihood that they retain their top talent and ensure their company's success.

Duracell battery deal: Buffett s new razor bladesEMAIL
AP
Warren Buffett sees value where others see trash. Batteries are Buffett’s latest target — and investors are looking to follow suit.
Shares of Energizer Holdings (ENG) , maker of batteries and the biggest rival to Duracell, are up $3.39, or 2.7%, to $128.45 as investors renew their interest in the industry. Investors are rediscovering batteries following Buffett’s announcement that he’s buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble (PG) .
The battery business is somewhat akin to the razor blade business, which Buffett has long shown an affection for. Users are batteries are constantly needing to buy replacements, setting up the industry as somewhat of an annuity.
But with Duracell snapped up by Buffett, that leaves Energizer at the last pure play for investors. Investors are also bullish on Energizer since it in April announced it will split its household products and personal care businesses into two separate companies.
Batteries aren’t a growth industry. Energizer’s revenue is expected to fall about 1% to $4.4 billion in 2015. But analysts like the stability. Energizer’s adjusted earnings per share is expected to be flat at $7.34 a share in 2015, says S&P Capital IQ.
Battery and lighting products account for roughly 45% of Energizer’s revenue. Shaving products are the second biggest source of revenue at 36%. The stock is rated “outperform” by analysts, who have a $130.50 average 18-month price target on the stock.
And while batteries might not seem like a growth industry — investors have been profiting. Shares of Energizer are up 122% over the past five years, topping the S&P 500.

The huge Warren Buffett - Duracell deal will save both sides billions in taxesBy Drew Harwell November 13 Follow @drewharwell

Warren Buffett on Thursday unveiled one heck of a playground swap: The legendary investor said he’ll give back $4.7 billion in shares he owns in Procter & Gamble, if the consumer-products giant hands over its newly recharged Duracell battery brand.
But don’t call it a sale. The unusual maneuver requires a level of cash and savvy that few mega-dealmakers could ever offer. The best part? Both sides could end up saving billions of dollars in taxes.
It’s called a “cash-rich split-off,” and it’s 100 percent legal under the country’s tax code. It’s also become a Buffett signature, offering all the perks of a high-level business trade with none of the costly downsides of a traditional sale.
“It’s a fantastic transaction,” said Bob Willens, a New York tax expert. “Every single time you see one, you marvel at how beneficial it is.”
It works like this. Procter & Gamble will give about $1.8 billion to Duracell, America’s biggest battery maker, then trade the company for the 52 million P&G shares owned by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.
The switcheroo is great for Procter & Gamble, which said last month it wanted to slim down by ditching half of its nearly 200 brands. The conglomerate gets to drop Duracell quickly and cleanly, dodge the mess and shareholder concerns of a protracted sale, and even stop paying regular dividends to Buffett’s Berkshire, which now owns a 2 percent stake in P&G.
But it’s just as sweet for the famed “Oracle of Omaha,” who will take over a big business for chump change. That wouldn’t have been the case if it was a sale. Because Buffett’s Berkshire bought its shares for about $336 million and they’re now worth about $4.7 billion, he would have had to pay a tax rate of about 38 percent on those billions of dollars in corporate gains.
Procter & Gamble will likely save just as much on its corporate taxes through “splitting off” Duracell instead of selling it. The deal, as P&G  put it , “maximizes the after-tax value of the Duracell business and is tax efficient for P&G.”
The cash-rich deal is unusual — Willens can remember about 30 such trades since the ’90s — because it takes a lot of different factors to accomplish: Namely, the cash part. The “seller” must agree to pump a ton of money into something it’s getting rid of, and the “buyer” must both own shares tied to the seller and want to give them away.
But it’s a tactic Buffett has tapped several times in deals involving the Phillips 66 energy company, Whitemountain Insurance and Graham Holdings, formerly The Washington Post Co. The latter deal, which likely saved both sides $675 million in taxes , was so emblematic of Buffett’s engineering that tax expert Willens, in a report earlier this year, called it “divorce, Omaha style.”
Berkshire became one of P&G’s biggest stakeholders in 2005 when the conglomerate bought razor giant Gillette, one of Buffett’s many investments. Berkshire owns more than 80 brands, including Geico and Fruit of the Loom.
Duracell is a titan of the world’s alkaline battery industry, creating not just the AA, C and 9-volt batteries that go in your kids’ toys and TV remotes, but batteries for hearing aids, cell phones, medical devices and home security systems.
“I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,” Buffett said in a statement. “Duracell is a leading global brand with top-quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.”

Activewear retailers make a run for Bucktown0
Activewear for several years has been propelling apparel sales, as comfort-seekers wear yoga pants and sweats as their leisure clothes instead of jeans, and performance fabrics are embraced in everyday wardrobes. Activewear grew 7 percent in the 12 months ended in June compared with the previous year, outpacing the 1 percent growth rate of the apparel market as a whole, and following growth of 10 percent in 2013 and 8 percent in 2012, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
As a result, traditional athletic apparel has become more fashionable and traditional fashion brands have invested in athletic apparel. If you peek into the window of Joe's Jeans, also on Damen Avenue in Bucktown, you see the premium denim brand's new Off Duty line for "fashion-forward fitness," including snake-print workout leggings and sateen joggers.
Bucktown, while not unique, has landed a notable concentration of sporty stores.
Ian Feinerman, a senior commercial broker with @Properties, wonders if the proximity to the 606 trail has something to do with it. The 2.7-mile elevated recreational space, expected to open next summer, cuts through Bucktown and will have an entrance on Damen.
"It's going to be a big draw for biking, jogging, walking," said Feinerman, who along with his partner, Michael Weber, brokered the Fjallraven lease. "It's an active activity, you have to have active lifestyle clothing to go with it."
But the trend also reflects Bucktown's desirability among popular first-to-market national and international retailers, which have increasingly moved into the neighborhood as several local independent shops have been priced out.
Los Angeles-based Toms is expected to open its first Midwest store at 1611 N. Damen Ave. this month, selling not only its famous one-for-one canvas shoes (it donates a pair for every pair sold) but also operating a cafe with Wi-Fi.
Detroit-based Shinola plans to open its first Chicago store late this month at 1619 N. Damen Ave., where it will sell its American-made watches, bicycles, journals and leather goods, and offer space for community events.
New York-based Steven Alan, San Francisco-based Peek Kids, Dutch retailer Scotch and Soda, and Swedish clothier Gant Rugger are other high-end brands that have entered the city via Damen Avenue over the past couple of years.
"A lot of these stores are the first in Chicago and they're choosing the Bucktown market over the Gold Coast," Brenner said.
In part that's because of the affordability of retail rents. Bucktown is pricey at upwards of $65 per square foot, up 25 percent from five years ago and exceeding rents in the tony retail corridors in Lincoln Park, yet far less than the $250-plus per square foot in the Gold Coast, Brenner said.
But it also has an attractive neighborhood feel that lends to its strength as a retail destination.
"People make it a point to go shopping on Damen Avenue in addition to hitting (the Gold Coast's) Oak and Rush," Brenner said.
Tricia Tunstall, owner of p.45, a boutique that has been on Damen for 17 years, said that while it has been sad to see some of the smaller stores leave, the quality of many of the newcomers, such as Shinola and Marine Layer, have kept the neighborhood feeling unique.
"Yes, they're corporate stores, but they're corporate stores that are not overexposed," Tunstall said. "They're different."

Ebola s True Toll Is Still Untallied As Another Deadly Fever LoomsEbola's True Toll Is Still Untallied As Another Deadly Fever Looms

Dr. Ross Donaldson recalls traveling around the Sierra Leone city of Kenema a decade ago, "telling people not to eat rats."
The multimammate rat, which is ubiquitous in sub-Saharan Africa, can carry a deadly hemorrhagic illness akin to Ebola, known as Lassa fever. Yet for many residents of the impoverished region, the animal remains a staple food.
"From a foreign perspective, it seems like a no-brainer," said Donaldson, who spent the summer of 2003 at Kenema Government Hospital's Lassa ward as a medical student studying the virus and treating its victims. He now directs the Emergency Medicine Global Health Program at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles County. "But when I was there, I could see a lot of things factoring in: the poverty, the lack of protein in the diet."
The scenario may sound eerily familiar. The hunting of primates and bats for food has been identified as a possible source of the current Ebola outbreak, which has claimed at least 5,000 lives in West Africa. While the cause is not proven, the outbreak's first victim, a 2-year-old child, may have been exposed to the virus while handling or eating an Ebola-infected bat.
Now Lassa fever too is threatening in those countries hard hit by Ebola -- Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea -- and other parts of the region.
Every year around mid-November, as the rains taper off and the dry season begins in West Africa, cases of the hemorrhagic fever generally ramp up. Nigeria reportedly began seeing its first Lassa outbreak of the season in October, only about a week after successfully containing Ebola. Estimates of Lassa fever's impacts in West Africa vary widely. Annually, anywhere from 100,000 to nearly 13 million people are infected, and between 5,000 and 67,000 die from the disease.
Experts warn that greater Lassa outbreaks across the region could be one of many ripple effects triggered by Ebola's re-emergence. With a severely strained health system scrambling to treat Ebola victims, care for and containment of Lassa patients may be limited. Other people may miss out on the medical care they need for prevalent infections such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, or even for common complications during childbirth. Sierra Leone already has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.
None of these sicknesses or deaths are counted in the official Ebola statistics.
"The Ebola outbreak itself probably pales in comparison to the true burden of disease from all the other illnesses worsened by the breakdown of the health care system," said Donaldson, who wrote a book chronicling his experiences, The Lassa Ward: One Man's Fight Against One of the World's Deadliest Diseases.

Unlike Ebola, treatment does exist for Lassa fever. However, it is usually effective only if administered early in the course of the disease -- at a time when Lassa's fever and vomiting can be easily confused with other conditions, including malaria, typhoid fever and Ebola. Consequently, some Lassa patients may be misdiagnosed, go untreated or even be exposed to one of those other diseases if admitted to a wrong ward. Adding to the challenge, fears of catching Ebola at a hospital are now keeping some people suffering symptoms from seeking treatment. In other cases, the help is simply not available. A number of doctors and nurses, including several Lassa specialists, have died in recent months from Ebola and malaria. Many more have walked off the job out of fear or are simply overburdened by Ebola patients.
In fact, when the current Ebola outbreak began, Kenema's Lassa ward was quickly repurposed to isolate and treat Ebola victims.
"Now, [they] don't have any place to put the Lassa patients," said Lina Moses, a Lassa researcher with Tulane University's Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium. She flew from New Orleans to Sierra Leone over the weekend as part of an international effort, she said, to get Lassa incident surveillance and patient care "back up and running."
No one is sure, Moses said, why only West Africa is affected by Lassa fever despite the multimammate rat's pervasiveness elsewhere in Africa. And some fear the disease could spread.
Thierry Wirth, a professor at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, told The Huffington Post of his concern that "scared emigrants" may attempt to escape the Ebola belt to countries not yet affected by either Ebola or Lassa. They could potentially carry one or both diseases with them.
He also agreed with other experts that the Ebola outbreak could heighten the risk of Lassa outbreaks where the latter disease is already endemic. Wirth co-authored a study in 2012 that concluded the Sierra Leone civil war -- which ended around the time Donaldson arrived in that country -- had probably amplified Lassa fever's spread by decimating the land and altering the movement of people and rats. Not all animals handle habitat disruption the same way. Compared to other creatures, the multimammate rat appears better able to adapt and thrive in a range of natural and human habitats, even as it carries and transmits a disease like Lassa.
Similarly, increased poverty as a result of the Ebola outbreak, said Wirth, could force people into more rudimentary lifestyles and more contact with these opportunistic rodents. Greater hunger might even drive more people to be "tempted by bushmeat," he said.
On the flip side, the attention Ebola has brought to the potential dangers of hunting local wildlife could also discourage the consumption of rats. "There are a tremendous amount of people terrified of eating bushmeat right now," said Moses.
But even if people avoid eating the rats, they can still be exposed to the Lassa virus. As the animal burrows into the common mud-and-stick homes, scurries under beds and scavenges for scraps of food, it leaves behind infected urine and feces.
With good reason, the global health community remains focused primarily on containing the Ebola outbreak and aiding those affected. But what will happen once Ebola does finally dissipate? Will world health officials turn to helping West Africa develop capacity to tackle the host of other illnesses plaguing its people? Will researchers seek greater understanding of the economic, cultural and environmental drivers of emerging infectious diseases, in an effort to prevent their spread the next time around?
Tara Smith, an infectious disease researcher at Kent State University in Ohio, is not optimistic. "I think we're going to see the same thing we see most of the time with epidemics in Africa," she said. "We get this short-term influx of supplies and good will and physicians, but then it gets ignored again."
Lassa fever is one of the "prototypical neglected diseases," said Donaldson.
"We could have vaccines or other interventions, but these things don't actually get made because there is not a perceived large market to make money," he said. "Much could be potentially done with a little bit of resource."
"I hope one of the benefits of this very tragic situation with Ebola," Donaldson added, "is that both Lassa fever and the health care system in West Africa get some longer-term help."

Chaniya Cholis, Dhamaals and Other Things We Make In India
She was a key witness in the Naroda Patiya massacre trial. That is not the only way Shakeela’s life is embedded in history though. The lives of three generations of Shakeela’s family tells the story of modern Ahmedabad.

The Garba season was about to begin. It was already mid-day and Shakeela still had three chaniya-cholis to go. Stitching five sets would get her Rs 200. Her legs moved frantically on the sewing machine as the red satin chaniya, with its immaculate pleats, went under the needle. She didn’t want to be disturbed but her two boys, Ashfaq and Junaid, 10 and 8 respectively, just wouldn’t reduce the television volume. She wanted to make enough money this Navratri season to be able to pay the monthly Rs 1,500 rent and buy a new pressure cooker.
Since she moved back to this neighborhood in 2006, it has mostly been about putting up a sometimes stoic, sometimes aggressive front, displaying her will to survive and fight. She can’t afford to be seen as being weak and struggling. She needs to prove that she is there to stay, no matter what.
Shakeela has been provided with two policemen – security arrangements by the Special Court for being a witness in its 2002 ‘dhamaal’ trial – but she does not always let them stay with her. They sit in the beat box on Naroda Main Road. Nor do they like being inside Patiya. There is only one narrow entrance to the ghetto. There are small alleys, open drains, garbage piles, choked gutters, flies and mosquitoes. Every other day, there is sparse water and even sparser power supply. Even the autos refuse to go inside. Who would believe that this is also a part of the ‘Manchester of the East’ or the ‘Gujarat model’ that the country wants to imitate?
The areas outside Patiya, in the rest of Naroda, are not like this. The neighborhood of Naroda has a rising skyline, new residential societies, hoardings with banks offering low interest rates to buy houses, new BRTS (Bus Rapid Transport System) stops, industrial parks, malls, multi-storey parking complexes, new factories and broad clean roads; some of it is even visible from the garbage dump a few meters from Shakeela’s house.
Shakeela calls the guards only when needed, like when she needs to leave home to go to the market. How can she trust them? It is the police who were mute spectators when her mother Qudrat and brother Mahmood cried for help twelve years ago. The police did nothing to save them when they were doused in petrol and set ablaze while still alive. Her brother Shabbir, his wife Zubeida and their children Sameena and Asif were maimed in front of their eyes. Nadeem, her three-month-old nephew, the prettiest child born in their family till date, was thrown alive onto a mass pyre. Shabnam, her 14-year-old niece, was raped and then cut into pieces by the same people who had cut open the womb of her cousin, Kausar Bano Shaikh. The police repeatedly misdirected them to areas where the tolas, a colloquial term used for mobs, were waiting to kill.
A fortnight ago, Shakeela’s husband Saleem worked for daily wages in a mill that was being renovated. This week he didn’t get any work. A year after the ‘dhamaal’in 2002, Saleem was forced to move back to Naroda Patiya while Shakeela and her four children stayed back in the Shah Alam camp. It was not safe for them, but all the daily wage jobs were in this part of the city. Real estate, new highways, airport renovation, the expansion of the industrial area – it was all happening here. He worked as a daily wager for a year.For the next eight years, Saleem was a street vendor in the Nehru Nagar market in Ahmedabad. In 2012, 200 street vendors were evicted from the market, following complaints of traffic congestion on the road. Since then, he has largely been doing odd jobs.
From 2003 to 2004, Saleem visited his family every 15 days, sometimes once a month. For the longest time, the children believed that Saleem was working in some other city. Almost like Shakeela’s father, Khurshid Ahmed, who worked in the textile mills in Ahmedabad and visited them in their village in Bulsar, on the Gujarat-Maharashtra border, every month, four decades before Saleem.
In the early 1960s, Khurshid and several thousands of other workers migrated to Ahmedabad to work in the textile mills. It was here in 1861 that Ranchhodlal Chhotalal established the first textile mill in Ahmedabad and successfully established the ‘Made in India’ brand in the next three decades. In the early years of Independence, there were 75 textile mills here, which reduced to 40 in the 1960s. Workers claim this was the last time pay was revised for them before 2012. On September 25, 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the ‘ Make in India ’ campaign to invite corporations from across the globe to invest and manufacture in India, the number of the mills here had shrunk to 15.
Around the time Khurshid settled in Naroda Patiya in the 1960s, migration to Ahmedabad had led to a 38 percent rise in the city’s population, Christophe Jaffrelot and Laurent Gayer’s book Muslims in Indian Cities: Trajectories of Marginalisations indicates. The book also suggests that most of them were landless Dalits and Muslims from rural areas in the vicinity who had moved, eyeing employment opportunities in the mills. Khurshid’s job as a weaver brought some respite to his family’s economic situation but it predictably didn’t go on for long. They worked as agricultural laborers before that.
Towards the end of the decade, seven mills shut shop. Seventeen thousand workers were left unemployed. Khurshid was one of them. The Majdoor Mahajan Sangh, a once-powerful and still extant trade union founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, could do nothing. Fewer jobs and greater competition eventually resulted in divisive, religious politics. The 1969 communal riots that began in Ahmedabad and spread to other parts of Gujarat were the last nail in the coffin. These Hindu-Muslim riots, the worst after the 1947 partition, took place during September-October of 1969 and claimed 660 lives, according to official records. Khurshid didn’t find a job after that for the rest of his life. Shakeela remembers her mother’s efforts to get Khurshid off alcohol. He was convinced he couldn’t find a job because he was a Muslim. Her mother Qudrat Bibi always retorted that he wasn’t getting a job because he was sinning by drinking alcohol.

A year later, Qudrat Bibi packed her family of four children and mother-in-law to Naroda Patiya. There were no jobs but there was work as a very poorly paid daily wager. This is how, all members of the family except Khurshid, who was an incorrigible alcoholic by then, started working in the nearby mills. Shakeela and her three siblings worked in the packaging department earning Rs 10-12 per day while Qudrat and her mother-in-law worked at the loom and earned Rs 30 a day. Their collective monthly wages matched what Khurshid had earned. And this how the family lived for twenty years.
Once, while working at the loom, the edge of Qudrat’s saree pallu got stuck in the machine. She got twenty stitches in her scalp, but the factory didn’t pay for her medical expenses. Shakeela remembers the factory manager telling them that they only paid for permanent workers. Qudrat was not one of them in spite of working for them for 10 years. By then, Khurshid was dead, and Shakeela’s elder brothers Mahboob Shaikh and Shabbir Ahmed had started receiving contracts from readymade clothes factories as tailors. They were paid per piece, like Shakeela is now.

Shakeela’s cousin Kausar was much younger than her. She had learnt diamond cutting and polishing. She fell in love with Shahid Sheikh and the two got married in 2001. On February 28, 2002, she was pregnant with their first child. She was due to deliver that night.
Shakeela was in the Shah Alam relief camp with Kausar’s father Khaliq Noor Mohammed Sheikh, when they found out what happened to Kausar. Earlier in the day, Sheikh had escaped to a nearby dhabha where he fell unconscious and had been brought to the camp. That day, Shakeela, her two kids, her sister in law, her niece and nephew had hid in the same dhabha. Her mother Qudrat was still alive though completely burnt, her legs and arms charred. When the rescue team came after several hours, there were very strict instructions for the only ‘properly alive’ to enter the rescue bus.
Shakeela still remembers her mother asking her to take her along but they were forced to leave her behind. She shivers each time she remembers that decision to leave her mother to save the rest of the family. They stepped on charred corpses to escape. She found the corpses of Qudrat, Mahmood, Sameena and Asif four months later. She never found the rest, nor has she ever managed a death certificate or a post-mortem report for any of them. Eighteen of her clan were killed in the dhamaal.
In the Shah Alam camp later that day, Reshmabano, one of the eyewitnesses who also testified in the Special Court later, told them what she had seen. The tola had dragged Kausar Bano and cut her stomach open. Her unborn child was swirled on a sword. Kausar was then set ablaze. In 2002, Kausar’s father, 70-year-old Sheikh, was the only surviving member in a family of 12. He was a contract painter who earned Rs 4,000 per month. Decades ago, with Khurshid, he too had lost his job in the mills. He had tried several times to get Khurshid work as a painter, but Khurshid was too far gone. Since the incident, nobody has been able to trace Kausar’s husband Shahid. In 2002 after his family was killed, Sheikh sold his two houses and moved to Karnataka where his in-laws still lived. No one knows if he is still alive.
* * * 
In 2008, Shakeela told Jyotsanaben Yagnik, the judge of the Special Court, how the police did nothing to save them or the hundreds who were killed in Patiya in 2002. The killers were also from the neighborhood, people who had once brought orders from readymade factories for Mahmood and Shabbir. Shakeela says some of the killers used to call themselves Dalits back then. After 2002, they began to call themselves Hindus – the ones who stay on the other side of the electric pole that divides the Hindus and the Muslims.
Shakeela remembers that in 1969 after the riots, the Majdoor Mahajan Sangh organized Hindu-Muslim unity rallies. She still remembers the posters and big processions. None of that happened after the dhamaal. After all, they were just daily wagers, not permanent workers with a union to support them, get them together.
After the 2002 dhamaal, none of the Sindhi mill owners or the Hindu factory owners wanted to employ Muslims, but lots of Dalits in her neighborhood found work at the same places. In a neighborhood that once had a large population of Dalits and Muslims, today only 500 Dalits are left out of the roughly 4,600 people who live in the ghetto, according to a rough estimate by Nazir Khan Pathan, who runs the only school in the Patiya. In 2002, he says the population of the area was close to 15,000. Most of them have managed to afford houses in better, ‘developed’ areas. More Muslims are moving into the area for safety in an increasingly paranoid city.
Qasimbhai, for example, who recently moved next to Shakeela’s house after the 29 August 2012 verdict in which 32 people – including Maya Kodnani, former Gujarat cabinet minister and BJP MLA from Naroda Patiya and Babu Bajrangi of the Bajrang Dal – were convicted. Nineteen members of Qasimbhai’s family were killed during the dhamaal in Gulbarg society.
The Muslims in this area have since found work as daily wagers in the factories for Rs 50-80 per day. The very skilled ones are paid Rs 150 per day. The minimum wage fixed by the Gujarat government for unskilled labor in these industries is Rs 214. The rest turned to street vending like her husband Saleem, with paan shops, tea shops, clothes, Chinese electronics, ceramic etc. Though with Ahmedabad being developed every month with new road-widening, road-beautification and flyover projects, there’s no room for street vendors with this progress. Shakeela’s cousin, who once sold panipuri on by Kankaria lake, has had no more access after its ‘beautification’ in 2008. Only licensed kiosks can now sell snacks to visitors. The cousin is now a daily wage laborer in a chemical factory. His entire family now accompanies him to work. Just like Shakeela’s did three decades back. The children are paid Rs 30 a day and the adults Rs 100.
After the 2012 judgment sentencing 32 convicts to life imprisonment, the threats to Shakeela have increased. The families of some of those 32 still live in that area. Every day, as they pass by, somebody or the other mentions how they will teach her a lesson for testifying in court. They do the same with other witnesses in the area.
Just yesterday when Shakeela was on the sewing machine, a woman whose husband has been convicted for rape and murder came to her door and said, “Stitch as much as you can. Will make sure this does not happen next year onwards. Tyohaar humara, paisa bane tumhara? (The festival’s ours, but you make the money?)”
Was garba-dandiya not hers to participate in? No time to waste thinking about it. She has to stitch the rest of the chaniya-cholis before the power cut in the evening.

WASHINGTON: Something about the deal smelled fishy.
China Marine Food Group Ltd, a Chinese company then on the New York Stock Exchange, spent $27 million in January 2010 to acquire a firm whose main asset was ``algae-based drink know-how.'' The weird thing: Three months earlier, the beverage formula had been valued below $8,800.
But when the US Securities and Exchange Commission tried to review the deal, it got nowhere. The company's Chinese accounting firm refused to provide documents. And the SEC has been stymied since.
And China Marine? Its share price topped $8 in 2010. It's now around 12 cents.
The case represents a cautionary tale for investors eager to invest in Chinese companies on American exchanges. Chinese companies like Alibaba, whose initial public offering this year set a record high, operate under lax standards compared with other stocks on US exchanges. That means higher risks for investors.
Worries about the risks of Chinese stocks also emerged from a recent Associated Press investigation of Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd. When that Chinese company went public in June, the US investment banking powerhouse Morgan Stanley helped it raise $654 million from foreign investors. But Tianhe's stock has lost 39 per cent since allegations emerged that it had exaggerated the value of its business.
``The protections that are often taken for granted are just not there,'' says Joseph Carcello, an accounting professor at the University of Tennessee.
More than 100 Chinese companies were suspended or kicked off US exchanges in 2011 and 2012, most of them for failing to file timely financial reports. These companies, including China Marine, had exploited a legal loophole so they could merge with American shell companies. By doing so, they elude much of the SEC oversight that comes from selling shares on US markets for the first time.
About two dozen of these companies have also been hit with SEC fraud or accounting charges. Yet the investigations have stalled because the companies' audit papers are in China _ beyond the SEC's reach.
  There are currently about 100 Chinese companies trading on the NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
China restricts foreign investment in some businesses. To bypass that hurdle, Alibaba and many other Chinese companies deploy a structure called a ``variable interest entity'' or VIE.
It works like this: The company listed on the US exchange isn't the actual Chinese company. Rather, it's a holding company, typically based in a tax haven like the Cayman Islands. Foreign investors have no say in the company's management.
As a result, Chinese managers can restructure a company in ways that threaten investors. Alibaba CEO Jack Ma, for instance, spun off Alibaba's payment service into a company he controlled without telling Yahoo, a major investor in Alibaba.
The VIEs are also legally dubious in China. In 2011, a Chinese panel rejected a contract between Taiwan-based GigaMedia and a Chinese gambling business that GigaMedia thought it controlled through a VIE. The manager of the gambling business had seized documents required to operate in China. And GigaMedia could do nothing.
In 2012, China's Supreme People's Court threw out contracts a Hong Kong businesswoman had used to dodge Chinese rules to invest in a Chinese bank. It cited agreements that ``conceal illegal intentions.''
Beijing could invoke similar reasoning to one day ban all VIEs, potentially imposing huge losses on American and other foreign investors, analysts say.
China bars US inspectors from audits done by Chinese accounting firms _ in order, it says, to protect its state secrets. This means most Chinese stocks on US exchanges don't comply with American law.
``It's a very serious problem,'' says James Doty, chairman of the Public Company Oversight Accounting Board.
Experts say Beijing likely fears the documents would confirm suspicions that Chinese companies are delinquent on loans from state-owned banks or are involved in corruption. Its stance has hobbled US investigations of stock fraud.
  Consider the China Marine case. Shares in the snack and beverage firm began trading on US markets in 2007. US investigators grew suspicious over China Marine's $27 million purchase of most of a company that was built around a drink formula it had bought a year earlier for just $8,776.
Had China Marine's accounting firm reviewed the deal? If so, had it determined the value of the acquisition?
Problem was, the accounting firm wouldn't turn over the papers. And China Marine's stock price plunged.
Two years ago, the SEC sued the China affiliates of the Big Five accounting firms, saying US law required them to provide the documents. In January, an SEC administrative law judge agreed and barred the firms from auditing US-traded companies.
The accounting oversight board is pursuing a deal with China to obtain the audits, an effort that Doty has made a high priority. Without a deal, more Chinese companies could be forced off US markets. And more investors would be burned.
Many analysts doubt it will come to that. Chinese companies want access to American capital. And American investment firms and stock exchanges want the fees they earn when Chinese stocks list on US exchanges.
In the meantime, the stocks trade on American markets without offering investors the protections they're supposed to enjoy.
For now, warns Dartmouth University finance professor Anant Sundaram, Chinese stocks aren't safe: ``I would not invest in those stocks. Period.''

Discovery of new India: Congress & BJP have a riot of words over Nehru | ViewBJP
(Jawaharlal Nehru’s 125th…)
NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru's 125th birth anniversary eve turned into a bad-tempered battle on Thursday, with BJP and Congress trading barbs, accusing each other of current and historical wrongs — and not inviting each other for their respective Nehru celebration events. Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, Congress president and V-P, respectively, called BJP illiberal, angry and governing by photo-ops.
Congress pointedly did not invite BJP leaders for its Nehru celebration functions.
BJP, whose government had celebrated Nehru without inviting the Gandhis, responded by saying the most harm to Nehru's legacy had been done by Nehru-Gandhis themselves and that photo-ops were a Rahul Gandhi speciality. Sonia Gandhi's strong attack on BJP urged Congressmen to fight those out to "demolish Nehru's idea of a liberal India." Her son, Rahul, said "angry people" are ruling India now and undoing Congress' "good work".
BJP responded in kind. The party's general secretary Murlidhar Rao told ET, "Congress has already demolished Nehru. Who dismantled Nehruvian socialism in 1991? Congress leadership has dismantled all aspects of Nehru's legacy of socio-economic policies long ago. Now, there is a big problem if one family tries to appropriate Nehru's legacy," Rao, an RSS wholetimer-turned-BJP politician, also argued RSS or BJP has not changed its attitude towards Nehru, but has merely acknowledged the role of the leader in steering the nation at a critical juncture.
"That does not mean that we accept everything that Nehru has said or done. Even Congress cannot do it because our world is not the one Nehru inhabited," said Rao.
Mohan Gopal, head of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Contemporary Studies told ET that, "from its inception, the only aim of the Indian right wing is to fight and defeat the Gandhi-Nehru ideology of social harmony, particularly, Hindu-Muslim unity, and the establishment of a new social order in which the masses enjoy equality and freedom. Any pretense of respect for, or acceptance of, any aspect of Gandhi and Nehru thought by the right-wing is only subterfuge intended to distort and confuse people about their true message and legacy."
Congress leader Beni Prasad Verma termed Modi's celebration of Nehru as a Congress victory: "The present prime minister , who had given the slogan of Congressfree India, first remembered Patel, then Gandhi and now Nehru. It is a good thing. Till the memories of these leaders remain among the people, the country cannot be free of Congress."
Such Congress claims received strong counters from the Sangh Parivar. Former editor of the RSS magazine, Organiser, R Balashankar, argued there is no change of heart in the Sangh Parivar over Nehru. "RSS has its own icons, but it has also inherited all the icons of the national movement as they belong to the entire nation. All the leaders of the national movement are our leaders too. Nehru led the country for 17 years. He was a patriot and we acknowledge it."
But Balashankar also hinted at the parivar's ideal approach to preserving Nehru's legacy: "It was Congress that distorted Nehru's image by giving him more importance than even Mahatma Gandhi...by appointing official historians to write about Nehru and to compile his writings. All that needs to be changed."
BJP's counter-attacks gained force after Sonia and Rahul Gandhi's pointed barbs at the party and its PM. "Massive attempts are on to destroy the vision of Nehru, the way he used to look at India. The forces which are doing this are targeting not only his persona but also his ideology, his vision, his life-long contributions and struggle," Sonia had said.
Rahul was no less critical. "They (BJP government) said do away with English. We should work only in Hindi. Had we done this after independence, our youths would not have been able to go to IITs, IIMs and foreign countries. Big promises were made and it was claimed that this or that will happen. But nothing of that sort has come out so far. Only photo opportunities are happening. I am fully confident that it is the Congress party which will once again lead the country."
BJP's response, that Rahul Gandhi's life has been a series of photoops, was as quick as it was in keeping with the day's political mood. Political scientist Jyotirmaya Sharma dubbed this entire exercise as poverty of ideas and principles. "A nation that has nothing to show in terms of ideas or soft power, only such a nation needs heroes. Only a nation that can't rectify its present harks back to the past. These parties are merely appropriating people and not their principles. A country that puts people before principles is doomed to mediocrity and failure. I think it was Brecht who said, pity the nation that needs heroes," said Sharma.

Asia Dips While Japan Bucks Trend, Oil Hovers Near Lows
Reuters | Updated On: November 14, 2014 08:25 (IST)
Tokyo: Asian stocks dipped in early trade on Friday following fresh signs of slowing Chinese growth, while crude oil hovered near a four-year low in an oversupplied market.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.25 per cent.
The index has been confined to a narrow range this week as the US economy outperforms the euro zone and China.
China's economy lost further momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low.
"As the Federal Reserve policy shifts towards monetary tightening, the kind of risk aversion stemming from emerging markets we saw at the start of the year may take place again," said Junichi Ishikawa, a market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.
"The European Central Bank will play a key role in preventing such risk aversion. We may see instability continue in emerging markets until they are convinced that easing from the ECB and Bank of Japan can provide global support."
Tokyo shares outperformed their Asian peers, continuing to draw support from expectations that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call an election in December and possibly delay a sales tax hike. The Nikkei was up 0.1 percent, after hitting a fresh seven-year high.
The dollar hit a seven-year high of 116.20 yen on swirling Japanese election speculation.
US retail sales numbers due later in the day are awaited for further impetus.
The focus is on how the US Treasury market would react to the data after slightly softer than expected U.S. jobless claims numbers nudged bond yields lower on Thursday and momentarily capped the greenback.
The euro fetched $1.2465, continuing to inch away from a two-year low of $1.2358 struck last Friday.
US crude oil was up 13 cents at $74.34 a barrel, although the bounce paled in comparison to the 3.9 percent drop the commodity suffered on Thursday, when it fell to a four-year low of $74.07.
Oil has been hit this week by factors including a stockpile surge at a delivery point for US crude and reluctance by Saudi Arabia to cut output when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27.
Crude prices have slumped more than 30 per cent since June.

Buffett - Duracell deal will save billions in taxesBy Drew Harwell November 13 Follow @drewharwell
Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway chairman and chief executive, during an interview Thursday. (Nati Harnik/AP)
Warren Buffett on Thursday unveiled one heck of a playground swap: The legendary investor said he’ll give back $4.7 billion in shares he owns in Procter & Gamble, if the consumer-products giant hands over its newly recharged Duracell battery brand.
But don’t call it a sale. The unusual maneuver requires a level of cash and savvy that few mega-dealmakers could ever offer. The best part? Both sides could end up saving billions of dollars in taxes.
It’s called a “cash-rich split-off,” and it’s 100 percent legal under the country’s tax code. It’s also become a Buffett signature, offering all the perks of a high-level business trade with none of the costly downsides of a traditional sale.
“It’s a fantastic transaction,” said Bob Willens, a New York tax expert. “Every single time you see one, you marvel at how beneficial it is.”
It works like this. Procter & Gamble will give about $1.8 billion to Duracell, America’s biggest battery maker, then trade the company for the 52 million P&G shares owned by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.
The switcheroo is great for Procter & Gamble, which said last month it wanted to slim down by ditching half of its nearly 200 brands. The conglomerate gets to drop Duracell quickly and cleanly, dodge the mess and shareholder concerns of a protracted sale, and even stop paying regular dividends to Buffett’s Berkshire, which now owns a 2 percent stake in P&G.
But it’s just as sweet for the famed “Oracle of Omaha,” who will take over a big business for chump change. That wouldn’t have been the case if it was a sale. Because Buffett’s Berkshire bought its shares for about $336 million and they’re now worth about $4.7 billion, he would have had to pay a tax rate of about 38 percent on those billions of dollars in corporate gains.
Procter & Gamble will likely save just as much on its corporate taxes through “splitting off” Duracell instead of selling it. The deal, as P&G  put it , “maximizes the after-tax value of the Duracell business and is tax efficient for P&G.”
The cash-rich deal is unusual — Willens can remember about 30 such trades since the ’90s — because it takes a lot of different factors to accomplish: Namely, the cash part. The “seller” must agree to pump a ton of money into something it’s getting rid of, and the “buyer” must both own shares tied to the seller and want to give them away.
But it’s a tactic Buffett has tapped several times in deals involving the Phillips 66 energy company, Whitemountain Insurance and Graham Holdings, formerly The Washington Post Co. The latter deal, which likely saved both sides $675 million in taxes , was so emblematic of Buffett’s engineering that tax expert Willens, in a report earlier this year, called it “divorce, Omaha style.”
Berkshire became one of P&G’s biggest stakeholders in 2005 when the conglomerate bought razor giant Gillette, one of Buffett’s many investments. Berkshire owns more than 80 brands, including Geico and Fruit of the Loom.
Duracell is a titan of the world’s alkaline battery industry, creating not just the AA, C and 9-volt batteries that go in your kids’ toys and TV remotes, but batteries for hearing aids, cell phones, medical devices and home security systems.
“I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,” Buffett said in a statement. “Duracell is a leading global brand with top-quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.”

On spoofing  smurfing  Ebola and branding outrageIt's a reference to the little blue workers of movies, TV, toy and book fame who use "smurf" in place of various words. Appropriately, like "spoofing," "smurfing" also has come to define a variety of other activities, legal and illegal.
But it's still enough to stop a casual news consumer in their smurfs and smurfing engage them.
After all, if something can't catch fire on Twitter and the cable news channels, it might as well not have happened.
Maybe it's that we're all exposed too often to too much bad stuff. Maybe we've found we can't keep wringing our hands without risk of becoming raw-skinned and arthritic. But after a while, both hackles and blood pressure become difficult to raise.
And, at the risk of invoking one cliche to banish another, let's stop pinning "-gate" on the end of words to convey that there has been potential wrongdoing or conspiracy. It's been 40 years since President Richard Nixon was drummed out of the White House because of the Watergate scandal and coverup and at least 20 years after the term grew tiresome.
Even the laziest comedians have grown weary of mocking the practice, consigning their annoyance to the same mausoleum for cliches that entombs wry observations about airplane flotation devices and mother-in-laws.
Seriously, Reuters on Tuesday reported on HairGate, a dust-up in which Apple iPhone 6 users are complaining that their follicles somehow are getting snagged in their new handsets. No. Just no.
BridgeGate, TrooperGate, NippleGate, HackGate, BillyGate, RatherGate, AngolaGate … enough.
Say what you will about the Secret Service scandal at the White House, at least it is virtually impossible to turn into a "-gate." FenceGate and OpenDoorGate simply don't work. But the Treasury Department unit entrusted to protect the president has an image problem.
#SecretService is getting rebranded for ridicule.
It's the one thing it can't get out of the way of, for smurf's sake.

Oil @ $80: Stocks that look poised to gain mostbranded textiles leader
(Investment theme: Stocks…)
MUMBAI: Indian markets are well positioned as with the fall in commodity prices such as crude oil & metals.
It will help companies which use these commodities as raw material, in improving their profit margins. According to analysts, the companies may pass through the lower input cost to customers still it gives some leeway in managing the efficiency and improving margins
Crude oil has corrected sharply after Saudi Arabia cut down oil price to the US after rise in US shale gas production. Metals, which rallied sharply in the last bull cycle, are facing a tough time due to slowdown in China.
"In the previous bull cycle of the equity markets we saw a significant rise in commodity prices which is not happening this time maybe because of slowdown in China or whatever other reason. So that is a very big positive for the raw material consuming industries," said Kunj Bansal , ED & CIO , Centrum Wealth Management.
"Companies like auto ancillary, companies like some of the consumer durables, companies like electrical and electronic equipments, fans and all which use steel could be a big idea wherein we can see a margin efficiency improvement," said Bansal added.
The other trend is the drop in crude oil prices. Industries such as plastics, petrochemicals, chemicals etc. use oil as raw material and are likely to benefit from lower input cost.
According to experts, overall the consumer goods sector will be a beneficiary commodity downturn. They can be bought at current levels and dips despite the stretched valuations most of them are available at.
"They are trading at stratospheric valuations and with some reason. Even as the economy was floundering for a while, the aspirational mode of consumers and families kept demand high for these products. The demographics are still favourable towards these companies," said Dipen Sheth, Head-Institutional Research, HDFC Securities
"Some of these valuations might look absurd right now but I do not think these valuations are likely to go away so if you look at the established leaders in the FMCG space like an Asian Paints or Nestle . Why should not a consumer goods company also trade at that kind of multiple and plus of course if they get benefits of lower commodity prices," he added.
He is bullish on Asian Paints despite the high valuations.
Sheth is also bullish on two stocks from consumer industry which he expects to give good returns in the long term.
Siyaram Silk Mills: They are going to announce results shortly. I do not think the results are going to make the stock run away anywhere but it is the branded textiles leader in the value space, it is a poly viscose fabric leader and has got an interesting bit of product mix. Higher value added fabrics are getting into their product mix. They have a fantastic distribution chain. They have been investing in their business for the last two or three years.
They are at the end of their capex cycle so there will be reasonably clean cash flows, high payouts. It is still going at 10x. I think there is value here.
Speciality Restaurants: They went into hibernation after the IPO. Their restaurants will take off as urban consumption revives and so you know what Jubilant trades at for example.
I do not think it is going to happen so spectacularly in the case of Speciality. But gross margins being where they are and food inflation now coming off, it is likely to drive their margin structure especially when occupancies increase.
When this catches the fancy of investors over the next two or three years when urban consumption takes off, people will notice this stock so we are putting our bets there for example.

Delhi elections: Arvind Kejriwal s AAP announces first list of candidatesNarendra Modi government for Gita as national scripture
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) today released its first list of 22 candidates fielding former ministers Somnath Bharti, Saurabh Bhardwaj, Satyendra Jain and Girish Soni in the Delhi Assembly elections, the dates of which are yet to be announced.
The party, however, has not included the name of its chief Arvind Kejriwal in the first list. It said that it is now screening all the applicants and some names, which have not made it to the first list, will be accommodated.
Soni, Bharti, Bhardwaj and Jain have been fielded from the same constituencies they had won in the last Assembly elections. Eight sitting MLAs also figure in the list.
AAP has not included any new face in the first list while fielding 11 other candidates who fought last Assembly elections but were defeated by a close margin.
“AAP has formed a probe committee led by party’s senior leader Anand Kumar and it will look if allegation emerge against any candidate during elections. If allegation is proved, party can even cancel their ticket in the last moment,” AAP’s PAC member Sanjay Singh told reporters here.
Asked why party then fielded Bharti, who is facing serious charges in Malviya Nagar midnight raid, Singh maintained that the former Law Minister was innocent and that he had gone there on request of local people and tried to help them in busting a “prostitution and drug racket”.
Among the sitting MLAs, who have again been given tickets, are Bharti from Malviya Nagar, Bhardwaj from Greater Kailash, Satyendra Jain from Shakur Basti, Girish Soni from Madipur, Manoj Kumar from Kondli, Jagdeep from Harinagar, Jarnail Singh from Tilak Nagar, Vishesh Ravi from Karol Bagh, Sanjeev Jha from Burari, Bandana Kumari from Shalimar Bagh, Som Dutt from Sadar Bazar and Commando Surender from Delhi Cantt.
The 11 candidates, who had unsuccessfully contested the elections in 2013 but given ticket again are Sandeep (Sultanpuri Majra), Anil Bajpai (Gandhi Nagar), Atul Gupta (Vishwas Nagar), Rajesh Rishi (Janakpuri), Gulab Singh (Matiala), Vijendra Garg (Rajendra Nagar), Kapil Mishra (Karawal Nagar), Jitendra Tomar (Tri Nagar), ND Sharma (Badarpur) and Bhavna Gaur (Palam).
AAP said the candidates have been selected based on their performances in their constituencies.
“Party may also release its second list of candidates in the next seven days,” another AAP leader Ashutosh Srivastava said.
He also said that the party would fight the forthcoming assembly elections on the issues of water, electricity, development, health and education.
In the last elections, AAP had selected candidates, who had attached signatures of 100 voters in their constituencies along with their applications, but it didn’t adopt such a process this time.
“In these Assembly elections, party has dropped the process of directing applicants to get signatures of 100 voters attached along with their applications,” Srivastava said.
In the assembly polls held in December last year, AAP had won 28 seats in its debut performance, but BJP was the largest party with 32 seats including a lone Shiromani Akali Dal nominee.

Military begins first quarantine-like monitoring in U.S. for Ebola mission troopsBy Dan Lamothe November 13 Follow @danlamothe
U.S. Air Force personnel assigned to the 633rd Medical Group loaded onto a C-17 Globemaster at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va., on Sept. 26, on their way to Liberia to assist with the U.S. effort to control the Ebola virus. The first troops to return to the United States will arrive on Thursday. (Photo by Senior Airman Kayla Newman/U.S. Air Force)
More than 80 U.S. service members will arrive in Virginia on Thursday after deploying to Liberia as part of the U.S. effort to stop the spread of the Ebola virus and will remain in conditions resembling a quarantine for 21 days.
The troops will arrive around noon at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, about 70 miles southeast of Richmond, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. None of the troops are showing any signs of the virus, but they will be in “controlled monitoring” for the next three weeks. It marks the first time the military has monitored troops in that manner in the United States.
The group includes 51 members of the Air Force; 27 from the Navy; four in the Marine Corps and two in the Army, Kirby said. They will undergo medical screening twice a day and be housed in a secluded area of the base west of the flightline that includes a dining hall and a gym. They will not be able to see their families in person.
“Troops will be able to communicate with family members via telephone and electronic means,” Kirby said. “Access to controlled monitoring area will be limited to health care, support and facilities maintenance personnel.”
Langley-Eustis will be one of several locations in which troops are placed in controlled monitoring. Others are at the Army’s Smith Barracks in Baumholder, Germany; Fort Bliss and Fort Hood in Texas; Fort Bragg in North Carolina; Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington; and at the Army base in Vicenza, Italy, according to the Defense Department .
The Vicenza site already has been used by a first wave of service members who returned to Europe after deploying. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel decided Oct. 29 that all troops returning from Operation United Assistance, the Ebola mission, be put into quaratine-like monitoring for 21 days, citing concerns from troops and their family members.
“This is also a policy that was discussed in great detail by the communities, by the families of our military men and women,” he said at the time. “And they very much wanted a safety valve on this.”
The troops in controlled monitoring at Langley-Eustis will stay in an area called the Langley Transit Center. Military officials have called it precedent-setting. It includes 21 buildings – dormitories, the dining hall, a gym, and an entertainment center built and managed by the Air Force’s 633rd Air Base Wing.
Langley-Eustis was chosen because it has a hospital with the capability to isolate patients, proximity to an airfield and the ability to provide lodging, transportation and controlled access to facilities, military officials said .
The military has released a number of photographs to show what the Langley Transit Center looks like. They prepared it for the arrival of troops in about 72 hours, using existing facilities on base:
The 633rd Air Base Wing established the Langley Transit Center in an expeditionary training center, shown here on Nov. 4. Base civil engineers retrofitted facilities with new heating, ventilation and air conditioning units, and lines were installed to pipe in telephone, high-speed Internet and TV service.

New Orleans police ignored hundreds of reported sex crimes  report saysBy Mark Berman November 13 Follow @markberman
A New Orleans police officer last year. (Doug Parker/AP)
A handful of detectives with the New Orleans police department routinely failed to investigate hundreds of reported sex crimes, following up on only one out of seven such cases over a period spanning multiple years, according to a blistering new report .
These five detectives, all with the special victims section of the New Orleans police, neglected to follow up on cases that involved injured infants and did not submit sexual assault kits for review, among other findings outlined in the report issued Wednesday by Ed Quatrevaux, the city’s inspector general.
In response to the report, the New Orleans Police Department said the five detectives, who were not named, had been transferred out of the special victims section. A task force was appointed to conduct a full review of all cases handled by these detectives during their time, the police said.
“There is no place for this type of behavior in our department,” Michael Harrison, the police superintendent, said in a statement. “I am committed to getting this right and continuing to work to rebuild the trust between our officers and our community.”
The police department also said its public integrity bureau is launching an investigation into each of the detectives cited in the report.
Investigators looked at 1,290 calls related to sex crimes that were assigned to the five detectives between 2011 and 2013. The five detectives only wrote 179 reports suggesting additional investigation beyond the first report, which covered just 14 percent of the total calls these detectives were assigned.
The report includes a series of troubling missteps that covered a variety of crimes. In one case, an infant taken to the emergency room with a skull fracture was found to have an old skull fracture as well. The child’s mother changed her story multiple times, the report says, but the detective determined there was no criminal action needed and closed the report. In another situation included in the report, after an infant was taken to the hospital with a skull fracture that a nurse determined may not have been accidental, the same detective conducted no investigation.
A different detective also reported that no results were found during an examination of a woman who said she was sexually assaulted, but it turned out the rape kit was never submitted to state police laboratory.
Supervisors in the police force were harshly criticized in the report for failing to notice the improprieties. In response, Harrison said the leadership at the special victims section has been replaced. In addition, detectives investigating sex crimes will now have more oversight from their supervisors while they are looking into these reports, the police department said.
This police department has come under fire before, with the Justice Department concluding in 2011 that the department routinely violated constitutional rights and discriminated based on gender, sexuality or race.
The latest investigation into the five detectives was launched after the inspector general’s office released a report in May outlining major problems with the way rapes were classified by the New Orleans Police Department. That inquiry found that the police incorrectly classified rapes as other offenses, which the inspector general’s office said raised concerns about the way investigations are documented.

Rahul says  angry  Modi destroying Nehru legacyNarendra Modi government for Gita as national scripture
Congress party leaders President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of spreading the “poison” of communalism and asked party men to fight those out to demolish Jawaharlal Nehru’s “liberal India”, intensifying the battle over his legacy.
While both the Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi did not take the name of Modi, the reference was obvious when they spoke at a party function on the eve of the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru here.
Rahul Gandhi said that “angry” people are nowadays running the country and had a dig at Modi over the “Swachchta Abhiyan” saying “photo opportunities” are galore.
“These days, the foundation of love and brotherhood is being demolished. On one hand houses are being painted and roads are being cleaned. Photo opportunities are happening. Snaps are being taken. On the other hand, poison is being spread. The very foundations are being weakened,” Gandhi said.
In her speech made in the presence of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit, Sonia Gandhi asked party men to be united and strengthen the organisations and connect and fight those forces out to demolish Nehru’s vision of a liberal India.
“Massive attempts are on to destroy the vision of Nehru, the way he used to look at India. The forces, which are doing this are targeting not only his persona but also his ideology, his vision, his life-long contributions and struggle,” she said.
The Congress President said that had Nehru been alive, he would have asked all Congressmen to fight communalism of all hues by becoming a “valiant secular soldier” for protecting the soul of India.
Out of power for the last six months after a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, the party is utilising the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru to rally round non-NDA parties on a platform raising the pitch of secularism.
It has organised an international meet on November 17 and 18 for which it has not invited Modi, who it accuses of appropriating the legacy of freedom movement leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Sardar Patel. Sonia Gandhi has extended invitations personally to leaders including Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee.

Flipkart’s Sachin Bansal discusses internet penetration, GST & India Post with IT Minister

(Bansal visited Ravi Shankar…)
NEW DELHI: A day after Amazon India head Amit Agarwal met communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Flipkart's founder Sachin Bansal , the largest domestic ecommerce company, called on the minister to discuss greater cooperation with India Post and for the implementation of the Goods and Services tax ( GST ).
Bansal also told Prasad that a disproportionate share of Flipkart's revenue came from the top 10 cities and better logistics as well as internet connectivity would increase the share of tier II and III cities.
"I spoke to the minister for a fast nationwide roll-out of 4G for better connectivity as this would boost e-commerce in the country, especially rural India," Bansal told ET. Speaking to ET, Prasad said that on the issue of India Post, his government was willing to modernise and recast the world's largest postal network.
"I was very glad to see a young entrepreneur from this country has raised an e-commerce giant," Prasad said of Bansal, drawing similarities between him and Mark Zuckerberg , the Facebook founder whom he met last month. "Our government has been pushing the Digital India project because we believe digital connectivity will push trade and e-commerce in rural areas," Prasad said. "Flipkart has been working towards bringing small weavers from parts of this country on their online platform and I told them they must make it bigger and involve weavers from all over the country — Meerut, Tirupur and Bhagalpur," Prasad said.
As reported by ET, Amazon's Agarwal met the minister the day before and spoke of strengthening the company's ties with India Post by allowing the use of new technologies such as real-time tracking and monitoring devices to develop a delivery mechanism based on smart logistics.
India's surging online retail market is expected to touch $45 billion from about $2 billion now, driven by an increasing internet user base backed by surging smartphone sales. This has attracted significant foreign investments recently in Flipkart and Snapdeal, even as Amazon itself announced a $2 billion investment in its India operations.
Both Agarwal and Bansal have pushed for the long-delayed goods and services tax (GST) to be implemented, saying it would facilitate the growth of e-commerce in the country as it dismantles interstate barriers and creates a common market.
Flipkart has also pitched for greater cooperation with India Post, as has Amazon, which already has a tie-up with the state-run organisation. "Bansal, like Agarwal, pointed out poor logistics, multiple taxation and lack of internet connectivity as the biggest hurdles in spread of e-commerce in the country," another person aware of what took place at the meeting told ET.
According to sources, Snapdeal's co-founder Kunal Bahal is also scheduled to meet the minister next week. Snapdeal declined to comment.

Rules for payment bank by month-end: RBIBank of India
(Instead of having local…)
MUMBAI: India Post and mobile companies have a good chance of getting a payments bank licence, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which is expected to come out with detailed guidelines by the end of the month. Besides, successful microfinance institutions may get a chance to migrate to commercial banking.
The state-run India Post was denied a licence in the first round of the recent licencing scheme. "We visualise mobile companies, but also companies with a large rural presence... maybe shops, maybe kiosks, but as well as possibly post office that would come into the payment bank licencing scheme," Raghuram Rajan, governor, RBI, said at a conclave on microfinance organised by agricultural lender Nabard.
The guidelines are now with the government for comments. "In the weeks to come, we will put out guidelines on new entities called payment banks , which will basically offer accounts to the excluded," Rajan said.
RBI also expects to give licences to small finance banks. Instead of having local area banks focussed on two or three districts, there are suggestions that there should be all-India small finance banks which are focused on small lending though they would be allowed to accept deposits. "This licence would offer avenue... should allow successful microfinance institutions to migrate towards a banking licence without abandoning the core business of working with the small and the excluded," the governor said. Rajan, however, warned the microfinance lenders against usurious lending practices and was also critical of the loan waiver practices of certain state governments.
Several entities, including Nabard, have expressed interest in setting up banks. "We would be keen to look at it closely and consider it as an option if the guidelines permit," said Nabard chairman Harsh Kumar Bhanwala .
Nabard is keen to seek a banking licence through its subsidiary NABFINs , a non-banking finance company with a focus on the bottom of the pyramid.
"We still want to be a fullfledged bank. The government will decide whether they want to give to us or not," said Pradipta Kumar Bisoi, chief postmaster general of Maharashtra circle, at an event in Mumbai.

(Asian stocks dipped in early…)
TOKYO: Asian stocks dipped in early trade on Friday following fresh signs of slowing Chinese growth, while crude oil hovered near a four-year low in an oversupplied market.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.25 per cent.
The index has been confined to a narrow range this week as the US economy outperforms the euro zone and China.
China's economy lost further momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low.
"As the Federal Reserve policy shifts towards monetary tightening, the kind of risk aversion stemming from emerging markets we saw at the start of the year may take place again," said Junichi Ishikawa, a market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.
"The European Central Bank will play a key role in preventing such risk aversion. We may see instability continue in emerging markets until they are convinced that easing from the ECB and Bank of Japan can provide global support."
Tokyo shares outperformed their Asian peers, continuing to draw support from expectations that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call an election in December and possibly delay a sales tax hike. The Nikkei was up 0.1 per cent, after hitting a fresh seven-year high.
The dollar hit a seven-year high of 116.20 yen on swirling Japanese election speculation.
US retail sales numbers due later in the day are awaited for further impetus.
  The focus is on how the US Treasury market would react to the data after slightly softer than expected US jobless claims numbers nudged bond yields lower on Thursday and momentarily capped the greenback.
The euro fetched $1.2465, continuing to inch away from a two-year low of $1.2358 struck last Friday.
US crude oil was up 13 cents at $74.34 a barrel, although the bounce paled in comparison to the 3.9 per cent drop the commodity suffered on Thursday, when it fell to a four-year low of $74.07.
Oil has been hit this week by factors including a stockpile surge at a delivery point for US crude and reluctance by Saudi Arabia to cut output when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27.
Crude prices have slumped more than 30 per cent since June.

Dow at Record But S&P Flat as Energy Weighs
Reuters | Updated On: November 14, 2014 07:19 (IST)
Buy UltraTech Cement, Sell TCS Today: Sanjeev Bhasin
New York: The Dow industrials closed at a record high on Thursday, boosted by gains in Wal-Mart, but the S&P 500 was little changed as energy shares tracked crude futures prices lower.
The energy sector cut its losses late in the session after Dow Jones reported Halliburton is in talks to buy Baker Hughes. Halliburton ended up 1 per cent after earlier falling as much as 4.6 per cent, while Baker Hughes rallied to close up 15.3 per cent at $58.75.
They were, however, the only two stocks to finish higher in the energy sector of the S&P 500, which closed down 1.3 per cent. Energy shares fell as Brent crude slid below $78 a barrel while US crude tumbled 3.6 per cent to $74.39, both at their lowest in more than four years.
Wal-Mart closed up 4.7 per cent at $82.94 after posting higher same-store sales for the first time in seven quarters. It earlier hit a high of $83.06.
"Wal-Mart is showing strength, showing the natural relation it should have with (lower) energy prices," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.
Consumer-related companies are expected to see more demand as lower gasoline costs free up cash.
"But while we're waiting for (other) consumer stocks to rise, lower energy prices continue to be a headwind," Hogan said.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.59 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 17,652.79, the S&P 500 gained 1.08 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,039.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.01 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,680.14.
Despite the slight gains, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1,974 to 1,085, for a 1.82-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,800 issues fell and 893 advanced for a 2.02-to-1 ratio.
Apple rose as high as $113.45 to a fresh record while Microsoft, up 1.7 per cent to $49.61, swelled to a market cap above $408 billion. It overtook Exxon Mobil as the second-largest publicly traded US company, behind Apple.
DreamWorks Animation shares jumped 14.1 per cent to $25.52 after the New York Times said toymaker Hasbro Inc was in talks to buy the Hollywood studio. Hasbro shares lost 4.3 per cent to $54.98.
US-traded BlackBerry shares jumped 7 per cent to $12.06 after it unveiled its new mobile-device management and security platform and struck wide-ranging partnerships.
The S&P 500 posted 67 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 139 new highs and 63 new lows.
Volume on US exchanges hit 6.4 billion, below the month-to-date average of 6.55 billion, according to BATS Global Markets data.

Markets closely track Dolly Khanna s portfolio for her  magic picksAmara Raja Batteries
(Most of these stocks —…)
ET Intelligence Group: Every bull market produces stars — those who churn one multi-bagger after another. One such name which is being closely tracked by avid market watchers, and participants these days, is Dolly Khanna.
With stakes of more than 1% in 14 listed companies, Khanna's shareholdings are worth at least a few hundred crores. Most of these stocks — mainly small-caps — have multiplied several times, earning her a devoted fan following on Dalal Street in recent years. But, there is one thing that flummoxes them: they don't know who Dolly Khanna is.
That is strange because such impressive stock pickings usually spark frenzied hero worship, especially among those who prefer to piggyback rather than identify their own winners to make big money.
The only time her name pops up is when she buys more than 1% or more in a company. No one knows how she looks though traders' blogs have some versions of her identity. But, those market watchers who insist on knowing more about the thoughts behind picking the stock winners, could benefit better by talking to her husband, Rajiv. The low-profile investor revealed to ET that Dolly Khanna is a homemaker and that he manages her investments.
For Chennai-based Khanna, stock investing is more of a hobby than a profession. The Khannas own Kwality Milk Foods, which sold its ice-cream business to Hindustan Unilever in 1995. With the money he got after selling the ice cream business, Rajiv Khanna, 67, started investing in the market in 1996-97 for the first time.
"It started as a hobby and remains a hobby. My core business is of milk products," said the lowprofile investor, who agreed to talk to ET over phone after weeks of persuasion. He did not respond to requests seeking an interview in person. Hawkins Cookers was his first multi-bagger. Khanna started accumulating the stock in 2007 and went on accumulating it till June 2009 at an average price of 130-140. Today, the stock is trading at Rs 3,400, and the company has given at least 70% of its profits as dividends.
Then, there was nothing stopping Khanna. He went on to identify small-cap winners such as Wimplast (more than 7 times in two years), Cera Sanitaryware (more than 7 times in two years ), RS Software (4 times in less than two years), and Avanti Feeds (more than 4 times in less than 6 months). Khanna's passion for picking stocks through extensive research can be traced back to his first job. A chemical engineer from IIT Madras, Khanna worked for ICI Ltd, a pharmaceutical company as a research person in the field of industrial explosives and blasting physics. In 1986, he started his company - Kwality Milk Foods. In the first decade of his investing career, gains from the market were modest. It was only after 2007 that the stakes started becoming bigger.
Dolly Khanna's portfolio (companies in which she holds more than 1%) has grown from Rs 1 crore in 2007 to Rs 175 crore at present. She also holds shares in several other companies but that does not appear in the shareholding of those companies. "We also have holdings in larger companies but we can't buy more than 1% of them," he said.
  Khanna has held most of the stocks in his portfolio for a long time now but he has also played the momentum game. For instance, he had purchased 1% stake in Amara Raja Batteries worth Rs 13 crore in the June quarter of 2012 and sold the entire stake in less than six months for Rs 39 crore, making three times the profit. "I am just somebody who got lucky. People just see the profits we make, nobody knows the kind of hits we have taken."
Khanna's latest bets (bought in the last one year) include Premier Explosives, Mold-tek Packaging and Nilkamal. These stocks have at gained significantly from the time of the purchase. He declined to talk in detail about his investments. But, when asked about Nilkamal, a plastic product company and the only stock in which he increased his holding in the September quarter, Khanna said "Crude has started correcting. Let's see what happens." He claims he does not talk to company managements before buying a stock. "We purely rely on the public information and act on it."
ET spoke to top officials of three companies, including Liberty Shoes, Manjushree Technopak and Nilkamal, in which Khanna's holding is more than 1%.
The officials said they have not heard of Dolly Khanna. While the name is well-known on Dalal Street, few in the market know about Rajiv Khanna. "Although I have never got to meet them, I'vebeen hearing of them. They have been able to identify good companies at a very early stage and have made good money through investments," said a Chennaibased fund manager.
When asked about the investment strategy, Khanna said, "It all depends on the underlying market condition. Like in tennis you play different games on different courts — hard court, clay court and lawn, we also study the market situation and pick our stocks accordingly. It can be either a value stock, growth stock, momentum stock or buying based on technicals." He feels market is the most complex puzzle, "It's not the money, it's the challenge what is exciting. Money is just the outcome. And once you start to understand the game, making money is not difficult," he said.

PM Modi arrives in Brisbane for G20 summitPM Modi arrives in Brisbane for G20 summit
PTI  Brisbane, November 14, 2014
First Published: 08:05 IST(14/11/2014) | Last Updated: 09:09 IST(14/11/2014)
Comments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday arrived in Australia on the second leg of his three-nation tour during which he will attend the annual G20 summit and hold bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott.
Modi reached Brisbane after attending the ASEAN-India summit and the East Asia Summit on November 12-13 in the Myanmarese capital Nay Pyi Taw.
The Prime Minister is on a 10-day visit of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji to attend key multilateral summits and undertake bilateral meetings.
Before his departure from India, Modi had said the importance of global cooperation against black money will be a "key issue" he will highlight at the G20 summit.
"A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money," Modi had said in a pre-departure statement.
As India attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad, Modi is expected to renew the country's commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
At the annual summit of the Group of 20 of the world's biggest developed and emerging economies, Modi had said he intends to discuss how it can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure, and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The two-day summit will be held from November 15. G20 accounts for 85 per cent of the world's economic output.
During his visit, Modi will also hold talks with Prime Minister Abbott in Canberra after the G20 summit.
Modi is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.
"While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential.
"A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India's economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood," he said referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney besides Canberra.

Fadnavis govt invalid; ask it to prove majority: Shiv Sena to Maharashtra Guv'Kiss of love' protest in Kozhikode marred by violence as 'Hanuman sena', cops intervene
Sharpening its attack on the Devendra Fadnavis government for its “manipulative” victory in the trust vote in Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, Shiv Sena yesterday met Governor C Vidyasagar Rao here and demanded that it should be declared a “minority” government and he should order a fresh confidence motion.
The former ally of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that Fadnavis government with current strength of 10 ministers is “invalid” as it fails to fulfil the provisions of Article 164.
Senior Sena leader Diwakar Raote said they have requested the Governor to ask BJP to prove majority “or else declare it a minority government and seek a fresh trust vote.”
“The President of India has appointed Governor to uphold the Constitution. But if the government itself is unconstitutional (then) is it not his duty to take action in the interest of people?,” Raote told PTI after meeting Rao at Raj Bhavan.
The fledgling BJP government won the trust motion in the Assembly through a voice vote yesterday, drawing angry reactions from Shiv Sena and Congress which have accused the ruling BJP of failing to prove its majority and “strangulating democracy”.
Terming the Fadnavis-led government as “illegitimate” which is formed by “violating” the constitutional provisions, Raote said, “Our delegation, led by (Leader of Opposition Eknath Shinde) has reminded the governor that this (BJP) government is an invalid government as per (provisions of) constitution.
“When it has only 10 ministers, how have they fulfilled the provision of Article 164 of the constitution?,” Raote questionned.
Article 164 (1A) provides that strength of council of ministers headed by the CM cannot exceed 15 per cent of the strength of the Assembly (the total number of MLAs) but it can’t be less than 12 members either.
Besides Shinde and Raote, the delegation comprised Pratap Sarnaik, Neelam Gorhe, Sunil Prabhu, Deepak Sawant and Ajay Chowdhary.
Raote alleged that minds of people have been “muddled” by the BJP, and that the party failed to provide clarity on the total number of legislators who voted for the party during the trust vote.
The withdrawal of PPAC in July had resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
PPAC is a surcharge given to the discoms to compensate variations in the market-driven fuel costs like additional costs on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
According to DERC figures, the private discoms operating in the city have a revenue gap of a whopping Rs 19,500 crore.
Official figures show that around 80-90 per cent of total revenue of discoms goes into purchasing power from central and state government owned entities through long-term power purchase agreement, at rates determined by the central and state regulators.
The city has seen a series of hike in power tariff in the past two years.
The tariff was hiked by 22 per cent in 2011 followed by five per cent hike in February 2012. The tariff was increased by up to two per cent in May 2012 year and again by 26 per cent for domestic consumers in July 2012.
It was hiked by up to three per cent in February last year and again by five per cent in August last.
The cost of buying power has increased primarily on account of an increase in the input prices of raw material like coal and gas, officials said.

Modi reads out the riot act to expanded Cabinet
New Delhi, November 11:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has read out a new set of conduct rules to his expanded Council of Ministers. These include instructions to work 24x7, even on public holidays and weekends.
In his evening meeting with the Cabinet after 21 new members were sworn in on Sunday, Modi spelt out what he believes constitutes desirable conduct for his ministerial colleagues.
While the older lot is already familiar with his gruelling work schedule which he expects others to follow, the PM made sure the message that there are “no holidays” is clear to the newer lot of ministers as well.
Most ministers in the new government are already putting in 14-16 hours of work every day and the PM drives them harder. “You work 13 hours, I will put in 14. You work 14 hours, I will do 15,” he had said in his Independence Day speech.
Modi also reportedly stressed on the need to maintain discretion about the internal functioning of the Government and avoid “leaks” to the media.
This applies to all internal communication, including something as casual as his instruction to the new ministers not to touch his feet or bow before him, which has been the usual practice after the formation or expansion of any Cabinet in recent decades.
These instructions were leaked to the media and Modi was not pleased even though he has made public statements to this effect.
“Please do not touch my feet, I feel awkward and embarrassed,” Modi had told his party MPs in the first meeting of the BJP’s new parliamentary party in June this year.
The PM is also strict about foreign jaunts by ministers, especially during Parliament sessions.
In the Sunday evening meeting, the PM also instructed the Cabinet Ministers to interact frequently with the Ministers of State in their respective departments.
Weekly meetings
He reportedly said it is a good idea for the Cabinet Ministers to have a structured weekly meeting with their junior ministers.
As the countdown begins for the Winter Session of Parliament, the PM asked his colleagues to be well prepared and briefed with regard to legislations concerning their respective departments.
No tours, either abroad or within the country, are allowed during the session and the PM wants maximum attendance in both the Houses.

A New Paradigm for Accountability: The Joy of Learningreddit
Now that we have endured more than a dozen long years of No Child Left Behind and five fruitless, punitive years of Race to the Top, it is clear that they both failed. They relied on carrots and sticks and ignored intrinsic motivation. They crushed children's curiosity instead of cultivating it.* They demoralized schools. They disrupted schools and communities without improving children's education.
We did not leave no child behind. The same children who were left behind in 2001-02 are still left behind. Similarly, Race to the Top is a flop. The Common Core tests are failing most students, and we are nowhere near whatever the "Top" is. If a teacher gave a test, and 70% of the students failed, we would say she was not competent, tested what was not taught, didn't know her students. The Race turns out to be NCLB with a mask. NCLB on steroids. NCLB 2.0.
Whatever you call it, RTTT has hurt children, demoralized teachers, closed community schools, fragmented communities, increased privatization, and doubled down on testing.
I have an idea for a new accountability system that relies on different metrics. We begin by dropping standardized test scores as measures of quality or effectiveness. We stop labeling, ranking, and rating children, teachers, and schools. We use tests only when needed for diagnostic purposes, not for comparing children to their peers, not to find winners and losers. We rely on teachers to test their students, not corporations.
The new accountability system would be called No Child Left Out. The measures would be these:
How many children had the opportunity to learn to play a musical instrument?
How many children had the chance to play in the school band or orchestra?
How many children participated in singing, either individually or in the chorus or a glee club or other group?
How many public performances did the school offer?
How many children participated in dramatics?
How many children produced documentaries or videos?
How many children engaged in science experiments? How many started a project in science and completed it?
How many children learned robotics?
How many children wrote stories of more than five pages, whether fiction or nonfiction?
How often did children have the chance to draw, paint, make videos, or sculpt?
How many children wrote poetry? Short stories? Novels? History research papers?
How many children performed service in their community to help others?
How many children were encouraged to design an invention or to redesign a common item?
How many students wrote research papers on historical topics?
Can you imagine an accountability system whose purpose is to encourage and recognize creativity, imagination, originality, and innovation? Isn't this what we need more of?
Well, you can make up your own metrics, but you get the idea. Setting expectations in the arts, in literature, in science, in history, and in civics can change the nature of schooling. It would require far more work and self-discipline than test prep for a test that is soon forgotten.
My paradigm would dramatically change schools from Gradgrind academies to halls of joy and inspiration, where creativity, self-discipline, and inspiration are nurtured, honored, and valued.
This is only a start. Add your own ideas. The sky is the limit. Surely we can do better than this era of soul-crushing standardized testing.
*Kudos to Southold Elementary School in Long Island, where these ideas were hatched as I watched the children's band playing a piece they had practiced.

By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:30 pm
The Supreme Court today asked the Centre to convene a meeting of chief secretaries of all the states within 10 days to find out the steps taken by them so far to provide shelter to homeless persons.
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu also asked the Urban Development Ministry to “find out ways and means to provide necessary temporary shelter to all homeless people in the entire country”.
“It is desirable that a responsible person of the Urban Development Ministry will call a meeting of chief secretaries of all the states to find out what steps they have taken in implementing the scheme of urban homeless people,” the bench, also comprising justices Madan B Lokur and A K Sikri, said.
It said that a report, giving details of the actions taken so far, be filed within three weeks and the meeting of the Chief Secys has to be convened within 10 days.
During the brief hearing, the bench said that it will not hear the matter relating to homeless persons in the national capital as the Delhi High Court is already seized of it and has been monitoring the development in the case.
Perusing the affidavit filed by some of the states, the bench said, “We can make out nothing from the affidavit. It’s not clear as to what they have done.”
The counsel for Delhi, however, said that 231 night shelters have been set up in the national capital and out of them, 84 are permanent and they can provide shelters to 17,000 homeless people here.
Prashant Bhushan, appearing for one of the parties, said that as per the census of the Delhi government, there are 39,000 homeless people in the city alone and the government claims that it can provide shelters to 17,000 persons only.
Moreover, these shelters lack basic civic facilities like water and sanitation, he said.

2002 Gujarat riots: Supreme Court for winding up proceedings within three monthsPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 6:42 pm
The Supreme Court on Thursday asked a trial court in Ahmedabad to wind up within three months the proceedings in Gulberg Society massacre case of 2002 Gujarat riots in which former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri and 67 others were killed.
Expressing concern over the accused languishing in jail due to delay in trial, a special bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu asked the Special Investigating Team (SIT), which probed the nine riot cases, to expeditiously proceed in the case.
The bench, however, said that judgement should not be pronounced by the trial court without its permission. Former CBI Director R K Raghvan, who is heading the SIT, said that it would be difficult to wind up the proceedings within three months.
The bench, thereafter, asked him to proceed expeditiously and allowed him to approach the court in case it is not completed within three months.
The bench in its earlier hearing had said it was considering to pass some order as letters have also been received from some of the accused that they are in jail for almost 10 years.
During the hearing on April 3, the court had expressed satisfaction over the progress of nine cases of post-Godhra riots in Gujarat probed by Special Investigation Team (SIT) which had given a clean chit to then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.
“There has been a lot of progress and out of nine cases, six are over and three are almost at final stage,” the bench had observed after perusing the progress report filed in a sealed cover.
The apex court has been monitoring nine sensitive cases after the National Human Rights Commission and various NGOs termed the investigation into these to be shoddy and unreliable.
Those cases were about the riots in Gulberg Society, Ode, Sardarpura, Narodao Gaon, Naroda Patya, Machipith, Tarsali, Pandarwada and Raghavapura.
An estimated 2,000 people were killed in post-Godhra riots in 2002.
The SIT had submitted its final report in the apex court in March, 2012 regarding Ahmedabad’s Gulberg Society riot case giving a clean chit to Modi and others in the 2002 riot cases.

Gogoi warns officers  says wont tolerate excuses for delaying projectsPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 13, 2014 8:36 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 2:00 am
Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, known for his take-it-easy stance, Thursday sounded tough when he warned officers against dilly-dallying projects and said no excuses would be tolerated especially in case infrastructure projects got delayed. This warning comes at a time when the Congress government has started gearing up for the next assembly polls slated for early 2016.
“There should not be any delay in moving the files for obtaining ceiling for funds. Timely utilisation of certificates is a must for getting the next installment of funds. The departments must submit the utilisation certificates without fail. No excuses will be tolerated for dilly-dallying things,” Gogoi said. He was reviewing the progress and utilisation of Plan funds with ministers and senior officials of various departments here on Thursday when he issued this warning.
Gogoi particularly directed officials to start various infrastructure projects without further delay and identified a major storm-water drainage project and a JICA-funded water supply project for greater Guwahati, apart from several roads and bridges including the Guwahati-Chandrapur-Morigaon Road.
Asking the departments to submit utilisation certificates on time to obtain funds from the ministries, Gogoi said he would strictly monitor utilisation of Plan funds by the departmental heads and would evaluate their performance by noting it down in their Annual Confidential Report (ACR). “How the senior officials of the departments have utilised their Plan allocation would be reflected in their ACRs,” he said.
The chief minister also asked the departmental heads to prepare specific-project and scheme on the basis of the benefits that would accrue from it. “The departments must identify the areas where specific projects can bring in benefits to the people. It must focus on backward and far-flung areas to ensure that the fruits of development reach out to the people. Projects must bring in benefits and they must be viable and cost-effective,” he said.
Joining Gogoi, state chief secretary Jitesh Khosla on his part asked senior officials to exert to the full in utilising Plan allocations to the optimum level. “Don’t go home, stay overnight and finish your job. The process of sanction and release must not be delayed at any cost. The impact in the fields has to be seen,” he said.

Satya Nadella  Ajay Banga  Dinesh Paliwal on Fortune Business Person of Year listInfosys founders, including Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
Three leading India-born CEOs, including Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, who took their companies “full speed ahead” have featured in Fortune’s Businessperson of the Year list topped by Google CEO Larry Page.
Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Harman International Chairman Dinesh Paliwal have been named among 50 global corporate heads by Fortune Magazine in its annual ‘Businessperson of the Year’ compilation.
Banga is ranked 28th on the list, Nadella 38th and Paliwal 42nd.
These corporate heads “kept a steady hand on the tiller — and took their companies full speed ahead” in a year of “tumult from volatile markets to viral outbreaks to a striking return to Cold War politics.”
Page, who topped the list, has “shown himself to be the world’s most daring CEO” by not only building the Internet’s “most profitable franchise” but also revolutionising transportation and “upending medicine.”
Fortune said Page has built his factory of the future while keeping Google’s multi-billion dollar business humming and positioning the company for a dominant role in the era of wearables and Internet-connected cars and homes.
“In a world where only the paranoid survive, Page has redefined paranoia into unbounded ambition,” Fortune said.
On Banga, Fortune said: “Sometimes it’s about being in the right place at the right time.”
For MasterCard, that very well could come in the form of Apple Pay, which may finally break the barrier between consumers and mobile payment, the magazine said.
“MasterCard and Banga could benefit from increased transactions using mobile phones. But the CEO isn’t letting MasterCard rest on its laurels, as the company continues its efforts to expand in China and other parts of Asia,” it said.
MasterCard’s presence in the region grew by 15pc through three quarters of 2014, compared to 2013, at a time when Asian economies have begun to show some signs of weakness, it said.
Fortune said Nadella introduced a “humbler, leaner, and hipper” Microsoft in his first year as CEO.
“Nadella, who took the helm from the notoriously outspoken Steve Ballmer last February, has initiated a complete strategic overhaul at the software giant.
“His ‘cloud-first’ approach, embodied in Microsoft’s own cloud platform Azure, is well on its way to become a USD 4- billion-a-year player, big enough to take market leaders Salesforce.com and Amazon head on,” Fortune added.
Paliwal has been leading Harman since 2007, and has overseen the development of Clari-Fi, a technology that restores the nuances that get lost when music is digitally compressed.
“Strong demand from clients like Ferrari, BMW, Audi, and Chrysler has turned Harman into a Wall Street darling, beating analysts’ earnings estimates seven quarters in a row.
“Business is so good that Paliwal recently announced a USD 500-million share buy-back over the next three years,” Fortune said.
The list also includes Apple CEO Tim Cook on the second spot whose recent coming out made him the first openly gay CEO in the Fortune 500.
“Replacing a legend is an exercise filled with peril. Yet three years into his stewardship of Steve Jobs’ company, it is becoming increasingly clear that Tim Cook knows what he is doing as CEO of Apple,” Fortune said of Cook who replaced Apple co-founder Steve Jobs after he died in 2011.
With the company’s stock at an all-time high, booming sales of larger iPhones and renewed enthusiasm for Mac computers, Fortune said the coming Apple Watch and the already released Apple Pay service show that “Apple remains an innovator — even under a CEO known more for operational prowess than product savvy.”
Others on the list are Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger (6), Alibaba Founder Jack Ma (10), Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg (13), Tesla CEO and last year’s business person of the year Elon Musk (18), Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (25), Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (34) and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (47).

Rohit beats Sri Lanka by 13 runsRohit beats Sri Lanka by 13 runs
4TH ODI, KOLKATA—World-record 264 by opener gives India a 153-run win over Sri Lanka.

India 404 for 5 (Rohit 264, Kohli 66) beat Sri Lanka 251 (Mathews 75, Thirimanne 59, Kulkarni 4-34) by 153 runs
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
Rohit Sharma 's first ODI in 10-weeks began with a touch of nerves. He was even kept scoreless in one Angelo Mathews maiden. By the end of the innings, his batting had become cartoonish. There was no shot he had not played. No part of the ground he had not exploited. No bowler who escaped his brutality. Rohit amassed 45 more runs than any ODI batsman had ever managed in an innings, finishing on 264 from 173 balls when he was finally caught off the last ball of the innings. India, almost incidentally, had moved to 404 for 5, despite having travelled at a run rate of less than six for the first 32 overs.
A record that will take some breaking.Rohit's innings was so ludicrous that the first 100 runs, which were hit at a run-a-ball, seems achingly humdrum in comparison to the 164 that followed. The surge had actually begun before he reached his century, when he plundered 14 runs in four balls, in Nuwan Kulasekara 's 30th over. Soon after that, the ball would be leaping off the middle of his bat with almost every stroke he offered.
There were many incredible shots, from among his 33 fours and nine sixes, but the most gobsmacking was the six off Kulasekara at the end of the 48th over, when he walked across to off stump, took a half volley from about a foot and half away from him and flicked it high over the midwicket boundary. It was the kind of shot, and innings, that seemed in open defiance of physics.
Sri Lanka had played a tour match against Mumbai to warm-up for the series, but little did they know Rohit was warming-up against them. He hit 145 from 111 in that match - his first competitive game since fracturing a finger in August - and he has now re-embedded himself at the top of the India batting order in the most resounding fashion imaginable.
The most dispiriting aspect of the flogging for Sri Lanka was their complicity in it. Shaminda Eranga had extracted a thick outside edge from Rohit in the fifth over, and though the ball carried comfortably to Thisara Perera at third man, he shelled the chance. Having been dropped on 4, Rohit would become the third India centurion this series to have been reprieved early in his innings. It makes sense, then, that since he hit a double-century, he should be dropped twice. Seekkuge Prasanna obliged him, when he shelled another straightforward chance off Rohit in the 46th over, with the batsman on 201 this time.
Kulasekara had strayed too straight to Rahane, in particular, who picked him off for a spate of leg-side fours to kick the India innings into gear, in a 14-run first over. Angelo Mathews and Eranga delivered more disciplined new-ball spells, claiming a wicket each inside the first 15 overs, but that is as good as the visitors' bowling effort got. Sri Lanka's lines and lengths worsened gradually from the 20th over onwards, until they had become almost farcical by the 35th over.
Another beautifully orchestrated batting Powerplay from India - between the 30th and 34th overs - brought them 67 runs, and was enough to hammer the Sri Lanka bowlers off their rhythm for the rest of the innings. Short, wide deliveries, thigh-high full tosses and rank long hops were presented with alarming regularity, and the fielding was almost as woeful. Sri Lanka had not expected to begin the series strongly, given their lack of preparation, but in these two disciplines, they have actually worsened significantly through the tour.
Having been joined at 59 for 2, Kohli and Rohit put on 202 brisk runs together, before miscommunication between the wickets saw Kohli run out for 66. That wasn't even the most astounding partnership of the India innings. When Rohit and Robin Uthappa came together in the 41st over, the score was 276 for 4. They would put on 128 runs in 58 balls together. Out of that, Uthappa's contribution was a run-a-ball 16.
By the time Rohit hit Kulasekara down Mahela Jayawardene's throat at long-off, the record for most fours struck in an innings had also tumbled, and Rohit was in possession of half the ODI scores over 200. One record he missed out on by one delivery, was Sunil Gavaskar's record for most balls faced. Gavaskar had made 36 not out.
Kusal Perera attempted to pull a short ball from way outside off stump and ended up scooping a catch to midwicket to collect his second duck of the series. Tillakaratne Dilshan was still visibly out of sorts, but he still outlived his next two partners. Dinesh Chandimal drove Stuart Binny uppishly to cover and Mahela Jayawardene was trapped in front by Umesh Yadav . When Dilshan himself fell, giving a catch to short cover off his leading edge, even the slim hopes Sri Lanka had of running down the total were effectively extinguished.
Mathews and Lahiru Thirimanne forged a 118-run stand for the fifth wicket, with Mathews hitting 75 off 68, and Thirimanne making 59 upon his return to the side. But even as the batsmen progressed briskly by usual standards, the run-rate kept on climbing, until it was above 11, when the pair were separated in the 29th over. Thisara came in to bludgeon 29, scoring 23 of those off a Karn Sharma over. But the Powerplay came, and both he and Thirimanne fell to Kulkarni, within four balls, to usher in the tail. Kulkarni removed two more from the lower order to finish with 4 for 34, and India completed yet another crushing victory.

PM Narendra Modi s agenda is communal'Kiss of love' protest in Kozhikode marred by violence as 'Hanuman sena', cops intervene
Congress national general secretary Madhusudan Mistry today alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was projecting himself as a “global leader” but his agenda was “communal”.
“Though Modi is trying to project himself as a global leader, his agenda is communal,” Mistry told reporters here.
He further charged that “the RSS persons are ruling the roost in the government. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is installing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) men as on high-level posts as officers”.
He alleged that BJP was using Congress leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, Abdul Kalam for political gains, saying that Congress will not let it happen.

Too big to jail  but not to rigFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
From rigging benchmarks in the $5-trillion foreign exchange market to manipulating them in the London inter-bank money market, the world’s biggest banks have not stopped at anything if they believed it would boost their bottom lines, reports fe Bureau in Mumbai.
From JPMorgan to Citigroup, BNP Paribas, UBS RBS, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, they’ve either evaded taxes or resorted to money laundering. Their reputations may have been sullied but it’s not clear how penitent they are — indeed, a couple have been repeat offenders.
To be sure, they’re paying the price for their misdeeds; regulators have fined top international banks a cumulative $320 billion between 2008 and 2014, according to an estimate by Wall Street Journal. The latest to cough up a penalty has been Citi, for misconduct in the forex market. BNP Paribas is expected to pay a record $9 billion penalty to US regulators for dealing with US-blacklisted countries.

Worlds most wanted woman terrorist white widow deadprint
Samantha Lewthwaite, dubbed 'White Widow', wrote an ode to the late al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden proclaiming her love for him
Samantha Lewthwaite or the White Widow has reportedly been gunned down in war-torn Ukraine by a Russian marksman.
According to The Mirror, Lewthwaite, the world’s most wanted woman terrorist,  had joined the Ukraine conflict just two weeks ago and was fighting on the side of a pro-government group, Aidar, as a sniper.
The Russian sniper who killed the British terrorist now has a bounty of $630,000 on his head from Ukrainian special services.
Muslim-convert Lewthwaite, who was married to London 7/7 suicide bomber Germaine Lindsay, had been on the run ever since she was linked to a failed plot to blow up hotels and a shopping centre in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2011.
The mum-of-four has reportedly been seen across Kenya and Somalia after allegedly becoming a top commander within al-Shabaab — the terror gang behind the Nairobi mall atrocity, when at least 67 people died in September last year.
Interpol made her world’s most wanted woman terrorist after her involvement in a Nairobi Mall attack.
Reports last month had said that she had joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and was one of its most prominent female fighters.
However, experts said the latest claims could be plausible if it was found Lewthwaite travelled to Ukraine to join radical Islamists fighting against Russia.
The White Widow’s dad, former British soldier Andrew Lewthwaite, 58, said at his house in Aylesbury, Bucks: “I have heard nothing. No one has told me anything. I’m not saying anything.”
Reports of her death came amid masses of propaganda from Moscow and Kiev over the Ukrainian crisis. And counter-terrorism expert Prof Anthony Glees said the claims could be a “diversion” by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Looks like there might be a wedding brewing on the oil patch, as investors wonder if Halliburton is looking to buy Baker Hughes.
The combination, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is still in the early stages. But if consummated would create an oil services powerhouse.
Investors are treating it like a done deal. Shares of Baker Hughes are up $8.29, or 16%, to $59.16 as investors see value in the deal.

Entrepreneurs from US and India exchange ideasInsurability
(“If you shut down a company…)
Indian entrepreneurs are beginning to think differently about failure and they are more willing to embrace the lessons from it than bemoan ill-luck, say global peers who are watching the boom in startup activity in the country.
"If you shut down a company in the United Kingdom, your mother will disown you. In Silicon Valley if you fail, people will say, good! What did you learn from it? I am seeing a lot of that here,' said Shaukat Shamim, founder of Silicon Valley-based YouPlus who rates this attitudinal shift as an advantage that India holds over China.
With nearly 800 startups launched every year, the country ranks as the third-largest hub for startups worldwide. But it has much to imbibe from mature markets even as it offers insights on how best to start up in an emerging market.
At a recent interaction curated by ET in collaboration with trade body Nasscom, entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and India debated the challenges they face in both markets and the lessons that each can draw from the other.
India offers many unique opportunities for startups that developed markets do not have. Testing her technology under harsh Indian conditions has enabled Rajeswari Kannan, cofounder of imaging technology startup LensBricks, to make her product rugged, which can work anywhere in the world. In Pune, Gautam Morey, founder of Sofomo Embedded Solutions is enabling healthcare devices to connect with the internet for instant delivery of data to doctors at much lower costs than in developed markets.
Self-belief, which several experts consider a pre-requisite for starting up, is taking root in India, as stories of successful entrepreneurs become part of household chatter. Vekrum Kaushik, chief executive at US-based staffing solutions firm for local businesses, PeopleCo, said in the past he would lose engineers in India because the perception was that there is higher risk of failure in small companies. "But now they know there will be other opportunities."
This sense of fearlessness is being fuelled by local role-models. Most urban Indians are aware of the billions of dollars in funding that ecommerce firms like Flipkart and Snapdeal have received. A whole generation of fearless students are passing out of campuses.
"These guys are not looking at the VCs. They are looking at their own ideas, failing, then coming back with something else," said Sofomo's Morey, who graduated from the University of Pune. Such an approach is critical for the development of a strong startup ecosystem -- even in Silicon Valley about 80% of companies fail. "Don't take the VC's word as gospel, it is one person's opinion about how the world is," said Shamim.
What sets back entrepreneurs in India are the multiple operational hurdles. For one, Kannan took three months to launch her company in India, she took just two days to establish the office in the US.
"One element that I find difficult and which emotionally drains me are the number of government dealings," said Anil Gupta, cofounder of Bangalorebased energy conservation technology firm SmartBuildings.
Gupta, who relocated to India seven years ago, after a two-decade long stint in the US, said he engages consultants to deal with this problem.
Through the discussion, the issues that participants agreed on was the negative impact on Indian startup ecosystem due to lack of healthy exits for investors and the attendant low valuation for Indian startups.
Earlier this year, when Facebook bought Bangalore-based tech startup Little Eye Labs, it paid an estimated $10 million. Months later, it snapped up mobile messaging firm WhatsApp for $19 billion. "It spreads like a virus, if 100 million people are subscribed to that I can guarantee you that you can get the same valuation," said BV Jagadeesh, managing partner at Silicon Valley-based venture capital fund KAAJ Ventures.
Anil Gupta of SmartBuildings was of the view that valuation is dependent on the pedigree of the investors and that overseas firms offer far friendlier terms when it comes to investment and valuations.
"We had buyout offers from traditional Indian companies, they are so miserly," he pointed out.
This niggardly attitude, according to entrepreneurs, is due to the fact that there are very few role models of investors who have gained from the startup boom. Only recently has this begun to change.
"The guys who sold redBus,(the online ticketing firm bought by South Africa's Naspers) immediately invested in five startups I know. This happens prominently in the Valley," said Morey of Sofomo.
Pallav Nadhani, who cofounded enterprise software venture FusionCharts while still a teenager, said discovering hot startups is still a problem in India.
In addition, regulatory constraints with regard to cross-border transactions hold back multinationals keen to buy an Indian company, while local players are unwilling to wager a bet.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC, buys 4 cr shares via rights issue & 6.5L in open market

Dalal Street
(He has acquired four crore shares…)
MUMBAI: NCC, a Hyderabadbased engineering and construction firm, has been under the spotlight on Dalal Street of late as investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has been raising its stake in the company in recent quarters. Jhunjhunwala, known to have a following in the market, increased his stake in NCC recently through the open market and by subscribing to the rights issue.
He has acquired four crore shares by subscribing to the rights issue and bought 6.5 lakh shares through the open market on October 31. He held 11.85% stake as on September 30, 2014 and with this purchase, his stake has risen to 12.78%.
So, what makes Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC?
Analysts believe the investor could be betting on a turnaround in the company as the rights share issue and sale of assets could cut debt. "We see an improved growth prospects for NCC with better liquidity and lower debt burden post completion of its rights issue," said Ashish Shah, analyst, IDFC Securities .
"With a leaner balance sheet and negligible capital commitment towards its asset portfolio, we expect traction in NCC's core EPC business."
NCC has risen by 33% in the last one month and 178% so far this year against ET Construction index's gain of 13% and 47%, respectively, during the same period. Private equity firm Blackstone held 9.9%stake in NCC as on September 30.
"NCC has multiple triggers waiting in the wings, which can lead to significant cash accrual and expect robust growth in the order book over the next two years," said Vibhor Singhal, analyst at Phillip Capital .
NCC's Rs 600-crore rights issue has been subscribed by 1.14 times last month. The proceeds from this issue will be used for repayment of its term loans and NCDs, which stand at about Rs 600 crore currently on a standalone basis. The borrowing cost of these loans ranges from 10-15% with the weighted average borrowing cost of about 13%. With these loans now proposed to be repaid, it is expected to result in interest savings of at least Rs 60 crore for the company.
Post the proposed rights issue, NCC's debt-to-equity ratio on a standalone basis will reduce to 0.6 from 1. On a consolidated basis, it will fall to 1 from 1.4.

Cameron plans orders to bar jihadis from returning to UK:BBCCameron is expected to announce exclusion orders aimed at barring citizens from re-entering the UK if they are suspected of being jihadi fighters.
By: Reuters | London | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:34 am
British Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to announce exclusion orders aimed at barring citizens from re-entering the UK if they are suspected of being jihadi fighters from war-torn Iraq and Syria, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported.
Under the orders, suspects would be banned entry into the country unless they agreed to be escorted by police before facing prosecution or close supervision under monitoring powers, the BBC said.
Simultaneously, suspects’ passports would be cancelled and their names added to the “no-fly list”, the BBC reported.
The exclusion orders, which may last up to two years, are central to a Counter-Terrorism Bill that Cameron announced in September, which if passed, will give the police powers to temporarily seize a suspect’s passport at the border to give authorities time to investigate them.
Currently only Britain’s interior minister has the power to withdraw a passport.
In September, Cameron said: “A British government should act in the national interest … to help keep our people safe and we should consider everything in the light of that.” He added that if it became necessary to act quickly he would do so without first seeking authorisation from parliament.

Dow at record but S&P flat as energy weighsDow
(The Dow industrials closed…)
NEW YORK: The Dow industrials closed at a record high on Thursday, boosted by gains in Wal-Mart, but the S&P 500 was little changed as energy shares tracked crude futures prices lower.
The energy sector cut its losses late in the session after Dow Jones reported Halliburton is in talks to buy Baker Hughes. Halliburton ended up 1 per cent after earlier falling as much as 4.6 per cent, while Baker Hughes rallied to close up 15.3 per cent at $58.75.
They were, however, the only two stocks to finish higher in the energy sector of the S&P 500, which closed down 1.3 per cent. Energy shares fell as Brent crude slid below $78 a barrel while US crude tumbled 3.6 per cent to $74.39, both at their lowest in more than four years.
Wal-Mart closed up 4.7 per cent at $82.94 after posting higher same-store sales for the first time in seven quarters. It earlier hit a high of $83.06.
"Wal-Mart is showing strength, showing the natural relation it should have with (lower) energy prices," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.
Consumer-related companies are expected to see more demand as lower gasoline costs free up cash.
"But while we're waiting for (other) consumer stocks to rise, lower energy prices continue to be a headwind," Hogan said.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.59 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 17,652.79, the S&P 500 gained 1.08 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,039.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.01 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,680.14.
Despite the slight gains, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1,974 to 1,085, for a 1.82-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,800 issues fell and 893 advanced for a 2.02-to-1 ratio.
  Apple rose as high as $113.45 to a fresh record while Microsoft, up 1.7 per cent to $49.61, swelled to a market cap above $408 billion. It overtook Exxon Mobil as the second-largest publicly traded US company, behind Apple.
DreamWorks Animation shares jumped 14.1 per cent to $25.52 after the New York Times said toymaker Hasbro Inc was in talks to buy the Hollywood studio. Hasbro shares lost 4.3 per cent to $54.98.
US-traded BlackBerry shares jumped 7 per cent to $12.06 after it unveiled its new mobile-device management and security platform and struck wide-ranging partnerships.
The S&P 500 posted 67 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 139 new highs and 63 new lows.
Volume on US exchanges hit 6.4 billion, below the month-to-date average of 6.55 billion, according to BATS Global Markets data.

Duracell deal: Buffett s new razor bladesEMAIL
AP
Warren Buffett sees value where others see trash. Batteries are Buffett’s latest target — and investors are looking to follow suit.
Shares of Energizer Holdings (ENG) , maker of batteries and the biggest rival to Duracell, are up $3.39, or 2.7%, to $128.45 as investors renew their interest in the industry. Investors are rediscovering batteries following Buffett’s announcement that he’s buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble (PG) .
The battery business is somewhat akin to the razor blade business, which Buffett has long shown an affection for. Users are batteries are constantly needing to buy replacements, setting up the industry as somewhat of an annuity.
But with Duracell snapped up by Buffett, that leaves Energizer at the last pure play for investors. Investors are also bullish on Energizer since it in April announced it will split its household products and personal care businesses into two separate companies.
Batteries aren’t a growth industry. Energizer’s revenue is expected to fall about 1% to $4.4 billion in 2015. But analysts like the stability. Energizer’s adjusted earnings per share is expected to be flat at $7.34 a share in 2015, says S&P Capital IQ.
Battery and lighting products account for roughly 45% of Energizer’s revenue. Shaving products are the second biggest source of revenue at 36%. The stock is rated “outperform” by analysts, who have a $130.50 average 18-month price target on the stock.
And while batteries might not seem like a growth industry — investors have been profiting. Shares of Energizer are up 122% over the past five years, topping the S&P 500.

UK-based workers of Jaguar Land Rover rejected a pay hike offer, saying that it falls short of their expectations, giving rise to a possibility of strike by the staff of the Tata Motors-owned company. However, the company feels the pay rise and pension package offered was generous given the current market conditions. The workers demanded more talks to avoid strike action.

Will central banks again ride to rescue of global economy?
R Sriram, ET Bureau Nov 14, 2014, 05.22AM IST

Australia
(More recently, the global…)
History has shown that landmark decisions affecting global economy and finance are sometimes taken in the shadow of great, dramatic developments. The Bretton Woods conference took place even as Allied armies were fighting their way through France and Belgium while Richard Nixon's famous gold shock of 1971 was driven largely by market turmoil caused by the plunging dollar and a rising Deutsche Mark.
More recently, the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008 sparked off unprecedented central bank intervention and the rise of unconventional monetary policies to lift the US economy out of recession. No such Damocles Sword hangs over the G20 leaders as they gather in Brisbane, Australia tomorrow for two days of hectic discussions.
But they would be mistaken in thinking that the central bank stimulus of the past few years has lifted the western world out of its deflationary spiral and provided enough fuel for emerging markets growth to take off.
While the US economy has improved and continues to perform better despite a political gridlock in Washington, the prognosis for much of the rest of the world remains weak. On October 31, storied economist Dr Nouriel Roubini said that the global economy is like a jetliner which needs all its engines to be functioning normally. Unfortunately, only one of its engines, the Anglosphere, is functioning properly. The other three, Eurozone, Japan and emerging markets are struggling to set right their problems and deliver growth.
The IMF cut its growth forecast for the world economy in October from what it had projected in July and warned of problems of weaker expansions in Japan, Latin America and Eurozone. On Thursday, in a paper published just ahead of the G20, the institution went a step further saying that growth indicators have worsened for both Japan and the Eurozone after the publication of the outlook in October. There is a risk of low potential growth in both advanced and emerging economies in the medium term, it added.
So, when leaders get down to business tomorrow after the toasts and stirring speeches, they have their job cut out. And it is not as if they are clueless. Much of the debate in the developed and emerging economies has focused on one main issue, painful structural reform that will increase competition, reduce bad debt and excess capacity, free up labour markets and deliver jobs, whether it is to the millennials in the US or to the burgeoning youth population in India.
But what is worrying investors and economists around the world is the lack of will among politicians. Whether it is Barack Obama bent upon pursuing his liberal agenda over jobs, or Francois Hollande's failure to tackle unemployment, or Shinzo Abe's inability to deliver to structural reform, there appears to be a general paralysis in decision making.
Eurozone is teetering at the edge of recession, Chinese growth is slowing and moving downwards as President Xi Jinping faces a growing list of problems ranging from corruption to over investment and excess capacity.
Abe's problems are even greater and the Bank of Japan's second round of monetary stimulus on October 31 is perhaps a clear signal that the three arrows programme has run into problems.
In fact, there is probably an even greater tendency among politicians and investors to rely on central banks to do a second rescue act. Far from being wary, central bankers appear to be willing to ride the tiger for the second time.
Federal Reserve governor Janet Yellen in a meeting in Paris early this month justified loose monetary policy and urged all her colleagues to employ all available tools, including unconventional policies, to support economic growth. The ECB appears ready to expand its easing while BoJ chief Haruhiko Kuroda has already served notice of his intentions with his October 31 bolt from the blue. Investors may rejoice in the short term if this happens but there is a price that will be paid in the end for lack of leadership and political will.

AAP announces first list of candidatesNarendra Modi government for Gita as national scripture
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) today released its first list of 22 candidates fielding former ministers Somnath Bharti, Saurabh Bhardwaj, Satyendra Jain and Girish Soni in the Delhi Assembly elections, the dates of which are yet to be announced.
The party, however, has not included the name of its chief Arvind Kejriwal in the first list. It said that it is now screening all the applicants and some names, which have not made it to the first list, will be accommodated.
Soni, Bharti, Bhardwaj and Jain have been fielded from the same constituencies they had won in the last Assembly elections. Eight sitting MLAs also figure in the list.
AAP has not included any new face in the first list while fielding 11 other candidates who fought last Assembly elections but were defeated by a close margin.
“AAP has formed a probe committee led by party’s senior leader Anand Kumar and it will look if allegation emerge against any candidate during elections. If allegation is proved, party can even cancel their ticket in the last moment,” AAP’s PAC member Sanjay Singh told reporters here.
Asked why party then fielded Bharti, who is facing serious charges in Malviya Nagar midnight raid, Singh maintained that the former Law Minister was innocent and that he had gone there on request of local people and tried to help them in busting a “prostitution and drug racket”.
Among the sitting MLAs, who have again been given tickets, are Bharti from Malviya Nagar, Bhardwaj from Greater Kailash, Satyendra Jain from Shakur Basti, Girish Soni from Madipur, Manoj Kumar from Kondli, Jagdeep from Harinagar, Jarnail Singh from Tilak Nagar, Vishesh Ravi from Karol Bagh, Sanjeev Jha from Burari, Bandana Kumari from Shalimar Bagh, Som Dutt from Sadar Bazar and Commando Surender from Delhi Cantt.
The 11 candidates, who had unsuccessfully contested the elections in 2013 but given ticket again are Sandeep (Sultanpuri Majra), Anil Bajpai (Gandhi Nagar), Atul Gupta (Vishwas Nagar), Rajesh Rishi (Janakpuri), Gulab Singh (Matiala), Vijendra Garg (Rajendra Nagar), Kapil Mishra (Karawal Nagar), Jitendra Tomar (Tri Nagar), ND Sharma (Badarpur) and Bhavna Gaur (Palam).
AAP said the candidates have been selected based on their performances in their constituencies.
“Party may also release its second list of candidates in the next seven days,” another AAP leader Ashutosh Srivastava said.
He also said that the party would fight the forthcoming assembly elections on the issues of water, electricity, development, health and education.
In the last elections, AAP had selected candidates, who had attached signatures of 100 voters in their constituencies along with their applications, but it didn’t adopt such a process this time.
“In these Assembly elections, party has dropped the process of directing applicants to get signatures of 100 voters attached along with their applications,” Srivastava said.
In the assembly polls held in December last year, AAP had won 28 seats in its debut performance, but BJP was the largest party with 32 seats including a lone Shiromani Akali Dal nominee.

Alibaba Singles Day sales reach $9 billionStory
Alibaba reports record $9 billion Singles' Day sales

E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding reported more than $9 billion in sales on China's Singles' Day on Tuesday, illustrating the buying power of the Chinese consumer and the importance of the event in the retail calendar.
Real-time figures on a giant screen at Alibaba's sprawling Hangzhou campus surged past 2013's record to 57.1 billion yuan ($9.3 billion) just after midnight after Chinese and overseas shoppers snapped up heavily discounted goods online.
The shopping day, similar to Cyber Monday and Black Friday in the United States, comes less than eight weeks after Alibaba's record $25 billion public share listing in New York.
Founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma said earlier on Tuesday that Alibaba's financial services arm, Alipay, also "will definitely go public", probably in China.
Ma later spoke briefly to reporters, saying he felt a bit nervous" due to the higher pressures and expectations now that Alibaba is a listed company.
Alibaba turned Singles' Day, a November 11 Chinese response to Valentine's Day, into an online shopping festival in 2009.
It copyrighted the "Double 11" term three years later after recognising its commercial potential.
"You're seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer," Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman, told reporters.
Alibaba had sales of 35 billion yuan during last year's festival.
The numbers this year were boosted by a "pre-sales initiative" under which merchants advertised prices as early as October 15, taking deposits for the items but only processing full payments and shipping the goods on Singles' Day itself.
Though the 27,000 vendors that take part can boost their sales and gain customers by being featured on Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping sites, some have complained that discounts and cut-throat corporate rivalry undercut the benefits.
Rivals such as JD.com, Suning Commerce Group Co and Wal-Mart Stores's Yihaodian have all gotten in on the Singles' Day act, but Tsai was bullish about Alibaba's pole position.
"I don't think any other company in China can create a day like this," he said.
The "11.11 Shopping Festival" began with just 27 merchants in 2009. This year's festival is global, reaching shoppers in more than 200 countries, the company said.

Spacecraft Lands On Comet For The First Timereddit
European Space Agency's Rosetta space probe on Wednesday successfully deployed its robotic lander Philae on the Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
This is the first time a spacecraft has ever landed on the surface of a comet. The mission was ten years in the making.
— ESA Rosetta Mission (@ESA_Rosetta) November 12, 2014
EU science chief Anne Glover tweeted that, "I think Europe just boldly went where no one else has gone before."
Philae touched down on an area of the comet named Agilkia, using harpoons and screws to latch on to the surface.
To see a minute-by-minute recount of the historic landing, check out HuffPost Science's liveblog.
Here's a timeline of the spacecraft's historic mission, courtesy of the AP:
DARMSTADT, Germany (AP) — The European Space Agency said it landed a spacecraft on a comet Wednesday for the first time ever. The Philae craft pulled off the audacious landing hours after it was released toward the giant ball of dust and ice by the unmanned Rosetta space probe.
The landing is the highlight of a decade-long mission to link up with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Here's a look at key moments during Rosetta's incredible trip:
___
March 2, 2004: Europe's unmanned probe Rosetta takes off from Kourou, French Guiana, after a series of delays, including an abandoned January 2003 launch window because of a rocket problem.
Feb. 25, 2007: Rosetta carries out a close flyby of Mars. European Space Agency's mission control breaks out in applause after the end of 15 tense minutes of radio silence as the craft passes behind the Red Planet.
Sept. 5, 2008: Probe successfully passes close to an asteroid 250 million miles from Earth. The spacecraft loses its radio signal for 90 minutes as planned during the flyby of the Steins asteroid, also known as Asteroid 2867.
July 10, 2010: Between Mars and Jupiter, Rosetta transmits its first pictures from the largest asteroid ever visited by a satellite after it flies by Lutetia as close as 1,900 miles (3,200 kilometers). It is the closest look to date at the Lutetia asteroid.
Jan. 20, 2014: Waking after almost three years of hibernation, Rosetta sends its first signal back to Earth. Systems had been powered down in 2011 to conserve energy, leaving scientists in the dark for 31 months.
Aug. 6, 2014: Rosetta swings alongside comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Nov. 12, 2014: The probe releases the Philae lander and it drops to the comet's surface. Seven hours later, Philae touches down on the comet.

Chinese President Suggests News Outlets Are The Ones To Blame For Visa ProblemsChinese President Xi Jinping Suggests News Outlets Are The Ones To Blame For Visa Problems

reddit
NEW YORK -– Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested Wednesday that international news outlets are at fault when it comes to problems securing visas for journalists working in China, in response to a question from a New York Times reporter.
The Times has encountered censorship in China, as well as difficulties securing visas for its correspondents seeking to work in the country.
Xi’s comments came during a Beijing news conference with President Barack Obama that included the announcement of a landmark climate change agreement between the U.S. and China.
As Obama wrapped up his remarks, the president acknowledged that the two leaders had agreed to each take one question from reporters. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called on The Times, which a U.S. official told Politico was an intentional move, given the challenges The Times has faced in China.
Obama responded to The Times’ Mark Landler, but a moderator then turned to a Chinese state-run news outlet before Xi could answer Landler's question, which was about extending the same visa rights to foreign correspondents that are afforded to businesspeople and students.
Xi eventually circled back to Landler’s question and said that “media outlets need to obey China's laws and regulations.” He then suggested, somewhat cryptically, that news organizations such as The Times are to blame for visa issues and should examine their own policies.
“When a car breaks down on the road, perhaps we need to get off the car to see where the problem lies,” Xi said, according to a White House transcript. “And when a certain issue is raised as a problem, there must be a reason. In Chinese, we have a saying: The party which has created a problem should be the one to help resolve it. So perhaps we should look into the problem to see where the cause lies.”
In his own report from the conference, Landler noted on Wednesday that the Chinese saying can also be translated as, "Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off."
Joseph Kahn, the international editor for The New York Times, tweeted in response , "The 'bell' he referred to is journalism of the kind we and other good news organizations do everywhere else."
The Times, which found its main website blocked in China in 2012 following an investigative report on the ties between wealthy families and the Chinese government, is unlikely to self-censor to in order gain access. So some tensions can be expected as long as The Times continues to report on areas that the authoritarian Chinese government doesn't want to see covered.
But the paper expressed a willingness Wednesday to further dialogue with authorities over resolving press issues. Kahn indicated in a statement to The Huffington Post that The New York Times is open to discussions with the government about issues related to reporting in China.
"President Xi said today, ‘We need to step down and see what the problem is,’” Kahn's statement said. “We are willing to work closely with the Chinese authorities to resolve the issues that have created a backlog of unprocessed journalist visa applications for our correspondents.”
“China is an important country and a big part of our international report,” Kahn continued. “We are enormously proud of our coverage of the country. Allowing us to have a full complement of correspondents there will enhance our ability to tell China's story fully and fairly."
The Obama administration has faced ample criticism from journalists over its unprecedented use of the Espionage Act to to target news media leaks, as well as over its continued efforts to compel Times reporter James Risen to reveal a source.
Yet over the past year, top administration officials have gone to bat for U.S. journalists trying to report from China. In December 2013, Vice President Joe Biden publicly addressed press freedom in Beijing and also met privately with foreign correspondents to discuss a then-urgent visa situation.
Landler said in his report that “the White House had lobbied intensively for reporters’ questions to be taken, and the Chinese authorities relented only a day before the leaders stood together in the Great Hall of the People.”
Journalists were clearly pleased that Landler was able to pose the question about press freedom directly to China's leader.
The Washington Post’s David Nakamura, who is also covering Obama's trip to Asia, wrote Wednesday that the Times reporter was met with a round of applause from the White House press corps at a hotel following the news conference.

India-born CEOs find place in Fortune listIndia-born CEOs find place in Fortune list
Yoshita Singh     New York   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 20:47 IST
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
Three leading India-born CEOs, including Microsoft 's Satya Nadella, who took their companies full speed ahead have featured in Fortune's Businessperson of the Year list topped by Google CEO Larry Page.
Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Harman International Chairman Dinesh Paliwal have been named among 50 global corporate heads by Fortune Magazine in its annual 'Businessperson of the Year' compilation.
Banga is ranked 28th on the list, Nadella 38th and Paliwal 42nd.
These corporate heads kept a steady hand on the tiller and took their companies full speed ahead in a year of tumult from volatile markets to viral outbreaks to a striking return to Cold War politics.
Page, who topped the list, has shown himself to be the world's most daring CEO by not only building the Internet's most profitable franchise but also revolutionising transportation and upending medicine.
Fortune said Page has built his factory of the future while keeping Google's multi-billion dollar business humming and positioning the company for a dominant role in the era of wearables and Internet-connected cars and homes.
In a world where only the paranoid survive, Page has redefined paranoia into unbounded ambition, Fortune said. On Banga, Fortune said: Sometimes it's about being in the right place at the right time.
For MasterCard, that very well could come in the form of Apple Pay, which may finally break the barrier between consumers and mobile payment, the magazine said. MasterCard and Banga could benefit from increased transactions using mobile phones.
But the CEO isn't letting MasterCard rest on its laurels, as the company continues its efforts to expand in China and other parts of Asia, it said. MasterCard's presence in the region grew by 15pc through three quarters of 2014, compared to 2013, at a time when Asian economies have begun to show some signs of weakness, it said.
Fortune said Nadella introduced a humbler, leaner, and hipper Microsoft in his first year as CEO. Nadella, who took the helm from the notoriously outspoken Steve Ballmer last February, has initiated a complete strategic overhaul at the software giant. His 'cloud-first' approach, embodied in Microsoft's own cloud platform Azure, is well on its way to become a $4- billion-a-year player, big enough to take market leaders Salesforce.com and Amazon head on, Fortune added.

Debt-Burdened Real Estate Firm DLF Posts Higher ProfitBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: India's largest real estate firm DLF Ltd, which has been shut out of capital markets for three years after a regulatory probe, reported a 9 per cent rise in profits in its second quarter, with sales edging higher.
DLF, burdened with $3 billion of debt, said late on Thursday that net profit for the July-Sept quarter was Rs 110 crore ($17.89 million) versus Rs 100 crore a year ago. Sales rose 3 per cent to Rs 2,013 crore.
Analysts on average expected the company, which builds homes, offices and shopping malls, to post a profit of Rs 108 crore, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In its harshest ever punishment, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on October 13 barred DLF and some of its executives from capital markets, penalising them for failing to disclose key information at the time of the company's record-breaking 2007 market listing.
The indebted company received temporary relief after it was allowed to redeem its investment in mutual funds to meet its cash flow needs.
DLF's cash to short-term debt stood at 0.32 at the end of March, suggesting its cash is not sufficient to repay debt maturing within a year.
DLF did not provide a full cash flow statement or an update on its debt position in Thursday's brief statement.

New-age medicines make it easier to control diabetesComments
It is a known fact that diabetes cannot be cured but it can be managed effectively for decades. Apart from the cost of tests and medicines, the biggest downside is that you have to take medicines and insulin injections - very often four in a day - for the rest of your life.
New generation of safer, more effective diabetes medicines and treatments now use long-lasting insulin analogues (a chemical compound similar to the hormone insulin) to control glucose fluctuations in the blood of the patient.
Over the past five years, three diabetes treatments have been approved: exenatide injection (injected twice a day at mealtime by people with type-2 diabetes with poor blood glucose control), pramlintide injection (as an add-on to insulin therapy to lower blood glucose spikes and food intake) and sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin (taken once a day to release insulin over a longer period of time).
"None of these drugs are a panacea but help, in combination with each other, to customise treatment to individual needs and treat those whose diabetes cannot be controlled with conventional drugs such as metformin or glitazone used to regulate blood sugars," says Dr Ambrish Mithal, chairman, endocrinology and diabetes, Medanta - the Medicity.
The injections - exenatide and pramlintide - also cause weight loss.
Huge market
Around 65 million people have diabetes in India, with the number expected to grow to 100 million by 2030. This makes the diabetes drug market as one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical segments in India, currently valued at around Rs. 5,000 crore. It is expected to be valued at Rs. 6,500 crore by 2015, an annual growth of 30%.
In the pipeline
Currently, two new classes of drugs are in the final stages of getting Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approval and are expected to hit the market within six months.
Among them is a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor called gliflozin. It is an oral medication to be taken once a day with or without meals and is used for treating type-2 diabetes.
"SGLT2 inhibitors block glucose reabsorption in the kidney, increase glucose excretion, and lower blood glucose levels," says Mithal.  "These were approved in the US and EU in 2013. Insulin degludec, an ultra-long-acting basal insulin, is the other. It's a convenient option for people who need flexibility in adhering to an insulin regimen for reasons such as frequent travel," says Mithal.
New developments
Globally, drug development is moving at a break-neck speed. Ongoing research has the potential of keeping diabetes at bay for a long duration.
Salk's Gene Expression Lab announcing earlier this year that injecting the protein FGF1 restored the blood sugar levels to within normal range for more than two days without side effects.
Sustained treatment with the protein didn't just keep blood sugar under control, but also reversed insulin insensitivity, the underlying physiological cause of diabetes without side effects, report researchers in the acclaimed science journal Nature.
"Since type-2 diabetes is progressive, therapies need to be changed often as it may lose its effectiveness over time. For example, some people with type-2 diabetes start with oral medications, and then move to insulin for more control," says Dr Sujeet Jha, head of endocrinology at Max Super Speciality Saket, New Delhi.
"Prevention, which includes a healthy diet and physical activity, is the way ahead, but it requires effort. The choices are there; we just have to nudge people towards choosing right," says Mithal.

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON/GENEVA (Reuters) - India and the United States settled a dispute on Thursday that had paralysed the World Trade Organization and risked derailing a $1 trillion package of reforms of global customs procedures.
The deal, which needs to be backed by all 160 WTO members, has resurrected hopes that the trade body can now push through those reforms, opening the way up for further negotiations.
India had plunged the WTO into the deepest crisis in its 20-year history in July by vetoing a deal on streamlined customs rules due to a lack of progress on its demands to be allowed to stockpile food without observing the usual WTO rules on agricultural subsidies.
That put the WTO's future in doubt just months after it appeared to have overcome decades of stalemate on the issue at a meeting in Bali in Indonesia.
"This breakthrough represents a significant step in efforts to get the Bali package and the multilateral trading system back on track," WTO director general Roberto Azevedo said.
"Implementation of all aspects of the Bali package would be a major boost to the WTO, enhancing our ability to deliver beneficial outcomes to all our members."
The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which has said streamlining customs procedures could add $1 trillion and 21 million jobs to the world economy, said the breakthrough would open the door to new trade talks.
"Today's breakthrough is a real victory for all of us: governments, consumers and business," said ICC Secretary General John Danilovich.
Linda Dempsey at the U.S. National Association of Manufacturers said the customs deal was "an unparalleled opportunity to boost global growth and commerce by the simple task of cutting red tape, streamlining border processing and adding transparency to customs operations worldwide".
The breakthrough is the second at the WTO in days, following a U.S.-China pact to cut tariffs on IT products, also billed as a $1 trillion advance. It also comes hot on the heels of a U.S. agreement with China on carbon emissions.
The U.S.-Indian deal is likely to be hailed as a victory for India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has stressed the importance of ensuring that its 1.25 billion people have enough to eat. His tough stance had also risked isolating him at his first G20 summit of world leaders in Brisbane, Australia, this weekend.
But Thursday's compromise included no major revision of the original WTO deal struck last December, which provided for India's food stockpiling to be shielded from legal challenge by a "peace clause".
A source familiar with the negotiation said the compromise replaced the "constructive ambiguity" about the duration of the peace clause with clear language that it would remain until a permanent solution was found.
"There's no renegotiation of Bali," the source said.
The peace clause is subject to disclosure requirements that India has not yet met and also requires that its policy does not distort trade.
Modi instructed aides early last week to strike a deal.
"From Modi's perspective, it's a major victory to say we've got an indefinite stay of execution on our food subsidy scheme," said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC in Singapore.
A food security law passed by India's last government expanded the number of people entitled to receive cheap food grains to 850 million.
In a recent disclosure to the WTO, India said its state food procurement cost $13.8 billion in 2010-11, part of the total of $56.1 billion it spends on farm support. Wheat stocks, at 30 million tonnes, are more than double official target levels.

DoT may offer Rs 11k Cr loan to allay BSNL c...BSNL
(DoT’s plans to deal with…)
KOLKATA: The telecom department is considering offering a soft loan of as much as Rs 11,000 crore to a potential combination of loss-making state-run telecom operators Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam (MTNL) to address BSNL's concerns about taking on MTNL's mammoth debt on its books.
MTNL currently has debt of Rs 14,600 crore, stems from multiple loans taken to buy airwaves four years ago to offer third-generation telecom and broadband wireless services. The burden is likely to lessen to about Rs 11,000 crore, including interest component, by the yearend as MTNL is due to receive a Rs 4,534 crore refund from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for its surrendered broadband wireless spectrum and could use most of that to repay loans.
"There is no decision yet, but a possible option to deal with MTNL's dues in the run-up to any potential merger into BSNL is a sizeable long-tenure soft loan at 1-1.5% to the post-merger entity," a top government official aware of the matter told ET. He said such a soft loan would roughly be equivalent to MTNL's outstanding debt at the point of merger with BSNL. MTNL provides telecom services in Delhi and Mumbai, while BSNL offers the same in the rest of India.
DoT's plans to deal with MTNL's debt come at a time when the government is weighing the pros and cons of delisting MTNL and merging it into unlisted BSNL. The government is considering options to revive the two financially stressed companies. MTNL posted a Rs 834.2 crore loss in the quarter through September, while BSNL reported a loss of Rs 7,085 crore in the year ended in March 2014.
In a recent presentation to the Prime Minister's Office, DoT had said that it hoped to secure Cabinet nod for the proposed BSNL-MTNL merger by June 30. However, DoT sources say dealing with MTNL's sizeable debt remained perhaps the biggest challenge for the government. "A workable solution for dealing with MTNL's debt without hitting Bharat Sanchar Nigam's balance sheet is critical for concluding any merger," a top BSNL official said.
BSNL is cagey about taking on MTNL's arrears in its books in the event of a merger, since it is already saddled with accumulated losses of more than Rs 30,000 crore.
An MTNL director said a soft loan could address BSNL's concerns but the government is fully aware that MTNL would also bring in substantial value into any merger transaction by virtue of its 3G spectrum in Mumbai and Delhi, its substantial real estate holdings and a mix of landline and mobile customers.

Nifty likely to open in red; metals may turn weak

Ashwani Gujral
MUMBAI: The Nifty is likely to open on a weak note following weakness in Asian markets. Disappointing economic data from China is likely to hurt sentiment in metals counters.
China's October factory output rose 7.7 per cent from a year earlier, which was higher August's 6.9 percent rise but below expectations and the second weakest pace since the height of the global financial crisis. Retail sales growth eased slightly to 11.5 percent, the slowest pace since early 2006.
"China's economy lost further momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low, reinforcing views that Beijing will need to do more to fight slackening growth," said Reuters report.
According to analysts, the Indian market is expected to consolidate after hitting all-time high recently. Sector rotation and earnings based price movement can be expected in trade in the near term.
"Sector rotation is going to happen while banks, oil etc go in for a correction, IT and pharma could pick it up from here. The market may not break 8,300-8,330, you may threaten to go down then come back again. IT has given a strong breakout after to four- five days of narrow range," said Ashwani Gujral , Fund Manager , ashwanigujral.com.
After drop in CPI inflation, the market can expect some good news on WPI inflation. It could ease to 5-year low following drop in food and fuel prices. An ET Now poll pegs the figure at a little below 2 per cent compared to 2.4 percent a month ago.
The Nifty ended at 8,357.85, down 25.45 points or 0.30 per cent and the S&P BSE Sensex closed at 27,940.64, down 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent.
In The US, The Dow industrials closed at a record high on Thursday, boosted by gains in Wal-Mart . The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.59 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 17,652.79, the S&P 500 gained 1.08 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,039.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.01 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,680.14.
Asian stocks dipped in early trade following fresh signs of slowing Chinese growth, while crude oil hovered near a four-year low in an oversupplied market. Japan's Nikkei pared gains after hitting seven-year high.
Nikkei 225 was down 0.39 per cent, Shanghai Composite was 0.57 per cent lower, Seoul Composite declined 0.73 per cent and Taiwan Weighted was 0.06 per cent down.

Asia Dips While Japan Bucks Trend, Oil Hovers Near Lows
Reuters | Updated On: November 14, 2014 08:25 (IST)
Tokyo: Asian stocks dipped in early trade on Friday following fresh signs of slowing Chinese growth, while crude oil hovered near a four-year low in an oversupplied market.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.25 per cent.
The index has been confined to a narrow range this week as the US economy outperforms the euro zone and China.
China's economy lost further momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low.
"As the Federal Reserve policy shifts towards monetary tightening, the kind of risk aversion stemming from emerging markets we saw at the start of the year may take place again," said Junichi Ishikawa, a market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.
"The European Central Bank will play a key role in preventing such risk aversion. We may see instability continue in emerging markets until they are convinced that easing from the ECB and Bank of Japan can provide global support."
Tokyo shares outperformed their Asian peers, continuing to draw support from expectations that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call an election in December and possibly delay a sales tax hike. The Nikkei was up 0.1 percent, after hitting a fresh seven-year high.
The dollar hit a seven-year high of 116.20 yen on swirling Japanese election speculation.
US retail sales numbers due later in the day are awaited for further impetus.
The focus is on how the US Treasury market would react to the data after slightly softer than expected U.S. jobless claims numbers nudged bond yields lower on Thursday and momentarily capped the greenback.
The euro fetched $1.2465, continuing to inch away from a two-year low of $1.2358 struck last Friday.
US crude oil was up 13 cents at $74.34 a barrel, although the bounce paled in comparison to the 3.9 percent drop the commodity suffered on Thursday, when it fell to a four-year low of $74.07.
Oil has been hit this week by factors including a stockpile surge at a delivery point for US crude and reluctance by Saudi Arabia to cut output when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27.
Crude prices have slumped more than 30 per cent since June.

Petrol  diesel duty hike to not pinch publicPetrol, diesel excise duty hike will not pinch public, say officials
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 14, 2014  | 09:12 IST

The excise duty on petrol and diesel has been hiked by Rs 1.50 a litre but the increase will not be passed on to consumers as public sector oil companies have been asked to shoulder the burden, a senior petroleum ministry official said on Thursday.
The hike, which was notified on Wednesday evening, will boost government revenue by about Rs 13,000 crore on an annual basis.
On their part, the oil companies expect to offset the increase as prices are declining in the international market and they are making an extra Re 1 per litre which they would have otherwise passed on to the consumer in the fortnightly revision.
The government has taken the step as fiscal deficit has spun out of control due to low tax collections. Excise collections, which indicate the level of economic activity, declined by 1.2 per cent during April-October to Rs 88,330 crore.
Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the nation's largest fuel retailer, said that the excise duty hike will not be passed on to consumers and adjusted against reduction in rates likely by this weekend. The fall in international oil prices had resulted in six consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and two in diesel in the last one month.
Total excise duty on unbranded petrol will rise from Rs 9.20 to Rs 10.70 per litre and on unbranded diesel from Rs 3.46 to Rs 4.96 per litre. Branded petrol attracts excise duty of Rs 10.35 per litre, which would go up to Rs 11.85 per litre, and that on branded diesel from Rs 5.75 to Rs 7.25 per litre. IOC chairman B Ashok said, "Revision in prices will be considered in the next fortnight (November-end).

Sterilisation tragedy: Toll rises to 13  doctor arrestedDeath toll in botched up Chhattisgarh tubectomy rises to 13
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014

Raipur/Bilaspur/Jagdalpur, Nov 12 (IANS) The death toll due to botched up tubectomies in Bilaspur district reached 13 Wednesday while 32 women were still in critical condition, an official said. Eighty-three women had undergone the surgery Saturday in Pendari village.
Doctor R.K. Gupta who conducted sterilisation surgeries on 83 women at Bilaspur's Nemi Chand Jain hospital has been taken into police custody. Four doctors have been suspended. First information report has been registered against four people, including civil surgeon R.K. Gupta.
Meanwhile, three women who underwent sterlisation surgery in Jagdalpur had also to be admitted to ICU after their condition worsened.
Though Ramnesh Murti, medical superintendent of Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, confirmed only 11 deaths, sources said 13 women have died after the surgery.
In another incident, two tribal women in Pendra village of Bilaspur district fell ill after undergoing sterlisation surgery at a tubectomy camp and have been admitted to a hospital in critical condition. Twenty-eight women were operated upon in the camp.
In Bakawand block in Bastar division, three women, who were operated upon for sterlisation, had to be admitted to ICU when their condition deteriorated after the surgery. They too had undergone tubectomy in a government-organised camp.
Hemant Singh, husband of one of the victims, said: "The women complained of pain in stomach after surgery. All three were taken to ICU. Initially, the officials did not disclose their condition."
In Ambikapur, a child reportedly died after vaccination.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has talked to the Chief Minister Raman Singh over phone and asked him to ensure that the guilty are not spared.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Wednesday asked the Chhattisgarh government to explain the deaths.
"The commission has issued notice to the government of Chhattisgarh, through its principal secretary, health and family welfare (department), calling for a report into the incident within two weeks," an NHRC statement said.
Chief Minister Raman Singh, along with state heath minister Amar Agrawal, had Tuesday visited the patients in Bilaspur.
The Chhattisgarh Congress has demanded resignation of the chief minister and state health minister. Defending the health minister, Chief Minister Raman Singh said he is not a doctor and he did not perform the surgeries. "So there arises no question of his removal," he maintained.
A team of seven doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, reached Bilaspur Wednesday to probe the incident.

Taliban releases photo of Wagah suicide bomber'Kiss of love' protest in Kozhikode marred by violence as 'Hanuman sena', cops intervene
Pakistani Taliban’s splinter group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar yesterday identified a 25-year-old man as the suicide bomber who blew himself up at Wagah killing 61 people, minutes after the popular flag-lowering ceremony at the main land border crossing with India.
The Jamaatul Ahrar group led by Omar Khorasani released the details of Hanifullah alias Hamza, claiming that he carried out the suicide bombing at the ceremony, a display of military pageantry which attracts thousands of spectators.
The outlawed group also released a photo of the bomber who belonged to a bordering town in Mohmand tribal agency.
The bomber blew himself up at the entrance of the parade complex soon after the completion of the ceremony last Sunday, said Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesman of the militant group.
He said they will also release a video of the attack, which the outfit claimed was carried out in retaliation to a military operation against the Taliban and tribesmen in the remote Fata region bordering Afghanistan, the Dawn reported.
The horrific attack at the entrance of the Wagah border parade venue killed 61 people, including 10 women and seven children, and left more than 110 injured.
Officials said the damage could have been greater if the attacker had managed to penetrate into the main ceremony area.
Ehsan said they chose Wagah Border because of its “international significance” and that it is occupied by more security personnel. He warned such attacks would continue.
He said that some groups are claiming the responsibility of the attack but those claims are baseless.
Another banned terrorist group Jandullah had also claimed responsibility of the attack.

Border of order and chaosTweet
Who will bend: Viswanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand lock horns at the World Championship, in a still from Album 61
For fans, a chess game is a mental duel. For others, it is two people locked in a room staring at each other. Album 61 succeeds in bringing the tensions to celluloid
One man has the crown. The other man wants it. It is the oldest game in the world. Or as Alexander Kuprin put it somewhat more poetically, “How splendid to be king, ruling not by right of succession or chance plebiscite, but by the power of one’s own mind.” Today at the World Chess Championship in Sochi, current world champion Magnus Carlsen will take on challenger Viswanathan Anand. In May 2012, Anand fought a match with Boris Gelfand for the same title. The documentary Album 61, which released at this year’s Hamburg Film Fest, is based on that clash in Moscow.
I call up the director of Album 61, Halil Efrat, who is based in Tel Aviv. “It’s a sports movie without any sports,” he says with a laugh. I get where he is coming from. Two of the greatest grandmasters on the planet slug it out in a battle of the mind. While these mental heroics transport chess fans into frenzy, what does it look like for ordinary mortals? Two middle-aged men locked in a room for seven hours every day. Who spend most of the time looking at each other. For a month. “The biggest challenge was how to make a sports movie for people who don’t understand chess at all. How do you show people just sitting, not moving, looking at each other for hours? How to make a tense film, how do you show the pressure?” Efrat experimented at the start, “I thought maybe I will try to describe what is happening in their minds with visuals. In the end, I invented a lot in the editing room.”
The World Championship is one of the most exclusive clubs in the world. Since 1886, there have only been 16 champs. While Anand is a living legend, his challenger Boris Gelfand staged an unlikely career renaissance. At 45, he was thought to be too old. Yet the Israeli slashed his way through a gruelling qualification event beating far younger opponents to become the Challenger. Efrat however says, “For me, it was not so interesting to make a film just about the chess match. It could be a good report, but a good film should have a story behind the story.” This underlying story was discovered during his research. Gelfand’s father, Abraham who was an engineer, had obsessively catalogued his son’s achievements over the decades, compiling them into 60 albums — part photo-albums, part scrapbooks.
“When I saw them in Israel, I decided this is what the film is about, this issue about parenthood — should they choose for the child or let them be free. This was for me most interesting.” Abraham Gelfand didn’t have any dilemma. When he found out that his six-year-old son had a natural affinity for the board game, the decision was easily made. Young Boris was going to become world champion. Abraham pushed his son with utter monomania.
A typical entry reads: Schedule: 07:15 Wake Up, Breakfast 7:25-7:30, Radio Show 7:30-7:35, School: 7:35, Lunch 14:00-14:30, (go out for a walk? no). And this when Gelfand was 8 years old! Abraham eventually ended up with 60 enormous tomes, part photo-albums, part scrapbooks, part logbooks, a life captured in graphs representing everything from emotional and physical to intellectual trends, from biorhythms to analysis of postcards sent by Gelfand from his travels — an enormous compendium whose collation ended only with Abraham’s death. The father’s disembodied voice is the narrator, compulsively tracking his son’s every progress.
The film is crisply shot by cinematographer Vitali Krivich, who isolates his subjects in an invisible board that we cannot see. Life is merely a pale reflection of the struggle on the board. Krivich captures the tiny gestures: The final pat on the back that Aruna Anand gives her husband just before he enters the hall, Gelfand winking at his first grade teacher when he spots her in the audience.
As we plunge deeper into the match, we begin to see the performative aspects. The theorist Alexander Shashin said, “Chess lies at the border of order and chaos”. This chaos comes forth as we scrutinise the players. At first they seemed like motionless gladiators locked in an invisible war. Now we see that it is like a Kathakali performance, every gesture, grimace, tic or mannerism stands between victory and defeat. We see the little gestures that form their repertoire — punctiliously arranging their pieces before the game — each player has his own way of pointing the snouts of the knights. For example, Gelfand’s eyebrows shoot up when he sees a move that he hasn’t expected. Anand’s stone-faced immobility rarely breaks, but when some gesture bubbles its way to the surface, is it something that he wants to be seen?
Album 61 sustains the tension right till the end. As the last game is about to begin, Gelfand’s wife Maya jokes, “At least he is not competing in the world parachuting championships. What harm could come to him here?” She knows, of course. As a chess wife, the board is the most terrifying place on earth. A world championship match is about watching someone’s lifelong dreams get crushed, for entertainment. “It is not about memory or math — you have to break someone’s personality,” as the commentator says.

China-India Development Fund looks to park Rs 30 000 crore in India s infra projectsChina-India Development Fund, amounting to $ 5 billion , has been launched for possible investments in infrastructure projects in India. (Reuters)

A private equity fund, christened as China-India Development Fund, amounting to USD 5 billion (over Rs 30,000 crore), has been launched for possible investments in infrastructure projects in India. Over Rs 6000 crore of this fund is expected to flow into Gujarat, official sources said on Tuesday.
The fund launched by Shanghai Entrepreneur Association (SEA) has the support of China India Trade & Investment Centre (CITIC), stated a release from CITIC here.
“Large infrastructure projects in India are not able to find adequate funding. In such a scenario, this fund will help provide the necessary finance. The SEA which has over 100 entrepreneurs is now looking for Indian partners which whom they can cooperate in various ways including joint venture participation for rail, highway, smart city and new city development projects,” said Jagat Shah, secretary general CITIC.
“The USD 5 billion is a private equity fund and we expect USD one billion to come to projects in Gujarat,” Shah told The Indian Express.
The China India Development Fund is looking to invest in Tran-state highways, inter-state highways, city ring-roads, transportation hubs, high-speed railways, international sea ports, airport construction, container wharf, iron ore wharf, satellite cities, industrial and logistic zones and real-estate.
SEA has over 100 entrepreneurs and where the leading company is Shanghai Pengxin Group which has more than 40 subsidiary companies with total assets reaching over 10 billion RMB (Renminbi).

Kelkar panel for PSC regime  market-based gas pricingPrint
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 1:01 am
An expert committee headed by former petroleum and finance secretary, Vijay Kelkar, has recommended a Production Sharing Contract regime or PSC linked to investment multiple for oil exploration and production, a transition to market-determined gas prices by 2017 and empowering the Director General of Hydrocarbons on the lines of Sebi to ensure that it emerges as an independent regulator for the upstream oil and gas sector.
The final report of the committee on a roadmap for reduction in import dependency in the hydrocarbon sector by 2030 indicates that the potential impact of the initiatives proposed by the committee over 15 years — 2016 to 2030 — could lead to annual savings of $70-80 billion in India’s import bill. Concerted policy efforts, such as the one outlined by the committee, could help India lop off a large chunk of its import requirements and decrease it to 40 per cent of the total requirements by 2030, it says.
The committee, whose report was reviewed by The Indian Express, has pitched more for the PSC model rather than the revenue-sharing model based on the Rangarajan panel which was adopted by the previous UPA government.
A PSC linked to investment multiple with a modified contract administration including self-certification of costs by contractors works better than a biddable revenue sharing contract, according to the final report of the committee.
The argument against a revenue-sharing contract is that it could lead to lower levels of production owing to reduced exploration efforts and lower recovery ratios besides high windfall gains to operators which could encourage contract instability.
Adopting the revenue-sharing model could cost heavily with the risk of potentially lower exploration and production, the committee has indicated. What’s more, the so called biddable revenue sharing contract is hardly used globally.
For boosting local production of oil and gas, the Kelkar committee has suggested a suitable contract model, policies and administrative support for coal mining, to provide what it says is a much needed impetus to encourage coal gasification. This could be a potential game-changer for achieving energy security, the report says.
The other key policy recommendations it has made includes producer prices for natural gas, without any government intervention and allowing for gas pricing by producers on a market-determined basis through transparent arms length transactions and in the interim period, linking gas prices to the international price of liquid petroleum products such as fuel oil.
Along with this, the committee has made out a strong case for fiscal reforms such as including oil and gas under the proposed Goods and Service Tax or GST framework to facilitate development of markets by simplifying taxation norms and ensuring similar prices of oil and natural gas country wide and waiving of customs duty on import of LNG for all purposes. Development of petroleum clusters along the east and west coast also forms part of the roadmap.

GST issues: Still no consensus between Central govt  statesPrint
By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 1:03 am
As the government works towards implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 2016, consensus between the Centre and states on crucial issues remains elusive.
After a meeting of the Empowered Committee (EC) of State Finance Ministers held here on Tuesday, chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said, “States have already said that petroleum, alcohol, tobacco should be excluded from GST. We are waiting for a response from the Centre. We have not received the revised draft Bill. We will discuss and offer our comments after we receive it.”
While the Centre is of the view that petroleum should be a part of the GST structure, states are against it. Further, the Centre has ruled out the proposal of constitutionally providing for GST compensation while the states are insisting on their demand for such a structure. The Centre has included its views on the two issues in the revised Bill, which the EC is yet to receive.
Further, the two stakeholders also differ on the issue of threshold for levying the tax. In its August meeting, the EC had decided to peg the threshold for the levy of both Central and state GST at Rs 10 lakh.
However, “In September, the Centre wrote to us suggesting that this decision of the EC should be reviewed. It suggested that the limit should be Rs 25 lakh. Even if it is not Rs 25 lakh, Rs 10 lakh limit should be increased … But finally the Committee took a decision that they will go by the decision that is already taken that is Rs 10 lakh,” Rather said.
As such the final call on threshold will be taken by the proposed GST Council. The Bill proposes to set up a Council that will decide on matters including tax rate and threshold. Interestingly, SAD-BJP- led Punjab has supported the Centre’s proposal of raising the limit to Rs 25 lakh. It argued that small traders should be kept out as their contribution to the tax revenue is minimal.
The Bill that was introduced by the UPA government in 2011 in Parliament has lapsed and the new government has to introduce it again. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has indicated that the Bill may be introduced in the Winter Session. The roll out of the new indirect tax regime has already missed several deadlines.
Rather, however, expressed hope that 2016 deadline for roll out is implementable. The Centre has also suggested the revenue-neutral rate (RNR) for the GST — 13.91 per cent for states and 12.77 per cent for the Centre.
“We have given states 7 days to comment on the RNR report. We will send it to the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy because RNR is based on 2011-12 figures and we have requested them to look at it keeping in mind 2013-14 figures,” he said.

Aviation ombudsman: Raju asks ministry to examine feasibilityPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 1:05 am
With public complaints against organisations like the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Air India (AI) and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) witnessing an upward trend, the aviation ministry has decided to set up an ombudsman “in the interest of redressal of public grievances and for ensuring speedy delivery of services”.
Civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Tuesday asked the secretary of his ministry, V Somasundaram, to examine the “feasibility of having an ombudsman for MoCA (ministry of civil aviation), especially for the attached offices and PSUs AI, AAI, PHL (Pawan Hans Limited), and DGCA”.
A senior ministry official said that the setting up of the body could take another four months after presenting the proposal before the Cabinet and receiving a go-ahead.
“The idea is to create a body empowered to give binding directions to the civil aviation entities run by the government in the country in cases of complaints from the public. It will create the much-needed forum to remedy grievances,” the official said.
While the ministry may plan to hand over the job to a retired judge in due course of time, the official said the forum would provide relief to consumers and act as a check on errant officers and employees. “The orders of the ombudsman would be binding; he could even recommend administrative action against erring employees,” the official said.

Rogue borrowers overdues swell to Rs 40 000 crorePrint
Written by George Mathew | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 1:06 am
Pushed to a corner by soaring non-performing assets (NPAs), banks have filed suits against wilful defaulters for recovery of over Rs 15,000 crore in the last 15 months.
With this, banks are now fighting for recovery of around Rs 40,000 crore involving over 5,000 records of wilful defaulters — or rogue borrowers who have the capacity to repay but defaulted on repayments — as against Rs 25,500 crore in over 3,800 records in March 2013.
According to Credit Information Bureau of India (CIBIL) figures, State Bank of India which has filed suits in 1,104 records to recover Rs 8,961 crore from wilful defaulters tops the list as on June 30, 2014. Punjab National Bank (PNB) has filed for recovery of another Rs 2,000 crore during the 12 months ended June 2014, taking its total suit-filed willful default accounts to Rs 5,122 crore. Central Bank of India has filed a total of 622 suits to recover Rs 2,548 crore.
While Cibil has already compiled the list of 5,096 cases involving Rs 39,656 crore for the quarter ended March 2014, the figure is expected to cross the Rs 41,000 crore mark in the June 2014 quarter following the PNB initiative.
PNB has filed cases against Winsome Diamond for wilful default of Rs 900 crore and Forever Precious Jewellery for Rs 753 crore. It has also filed suit against Zoom Developers for recovery of Rs 410 crore.
Banking sources say the real wilful defaults could be more than double of this at around Rs 80,000 crore as banks are yet to declare many top corporate borrowers as wilful defaulters.
For example, some banks have not declared Kingfisher Airlines which owes Rs 4,000 crore and Winsome-Forever Precious (Rs 5,000 crore) as wilful defaulters. “Getting the money back from a wilful defaulter is a tough proposition. The process can go on for several years. In some cases, there’s no sufficient collateral or assets to recover the money,” said a PSU bank official.
The RBI has defined a wilful default as deliberate non-payment of the dues despite adequate cash flow and good networth, siphoning off of funds to the detriment of the defaulting unit, assets financed either not been purchased or been sold and proceeds have been misutilised, misrepresentation or falsification of records, disposal or removal of securities without bank’s knowledge and fraudulent transactions by the borrower.
However, some of the wilful defaulters have been challenging the banks’ decisions in the courts to delay the process. The RBI has now formed guidelines for non-cooperative defaulters who resist repaying at every corner and hold up the entire repayment process. In such cases, the recourse to legal remedy by a borrower imposes a cost to the system and banks are unable to get back their money using the existing laws such as the Sarfaesi Act.

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
Employee unions of public sector banks went on a nationwide strike today to press for wage revision, affecting banking services like cheque clearance and withdrawal from branches across the country.
However, branches of private sector banks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank remained open. At the same time, most of the ATMs of all banks were functioning normally, as per initial reports.
“Strike is complete and total. This strike has been forced upon us as bank management did not yield to our scaled down demands,” United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) Convener M V Murali told PTI.
Banks, including the country’s largest one SBI, have already informed customers about the inconvenience they are likely to face.
“UFBU has given a notice to IBA calling for nationwide bank strike on November 12 and All-India State Bank Officers’ Federation and All-India State Bank of India Staff Federation, being a part of UFBU, will also participate in the said strike,” SBI had said in a statement.
“Since the said call is given at all-India level covering all banks, the bank will not be impacted separately,” the statement said.
The staff of public sector banks had gone on a nationwide strike for two days beginning February 10 after discussions with the IBA failed. The wage revision of public sector bank employees has been due since November 2012.
The UFBU is an umbrella organisation of nine bank employees and officer unions.
There are 27 public sector banks in the country with a combined employee strength of about 8 lakh. There are about 50,000 branches of these banks across the country.

UK Deputy PM Nick Clegg attributes South Asia growth to Modi dividendBy: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:26 pm
UK’s Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has attributed South Asia’s projected growth momentum this year to the “Modi dividend”, citing the Indian Prime Minister’s initiatives for boosting investment and jobs.
The UK’s coalition leader quoted recent World Bank figures, which forecast South Asia to grow by over 6 per cent this year, making it the second-fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific region.
“A huge amount of this momentum is being driven by what the World Bank calls the Modi dividend,” Clegg said in his address at the annual dinner event organised by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Asian Business Association (ABA) here last evening.
“Prime Minister Modi has made boosting investment, jobs and growth a priority for his Government and, when I met with him in the summer, we discussed the critical role Britain could play in helping India realise its ambitions,” he added.
The Liberal Democrat leader also stressed on the important contribution made by Asian businesses to the British economy.
“There are an estimated 300,000 ethnic-minority led SMEs [small and medium enterprises] in the UK, contributing around 30 billion British Pounds to the UK economy every year.
“You are wealth creators in every sense of the word,” he said, adding, his party stands for an economy that is open to immigration.
“I have been clear about my concerns regarding the way in which the debates over immigration and Europe in this country are moving. There are critical issues to address… but, more than ever, responsible politicians and businesses need to defend Britain’s status as an open economy,” he said.
The ABA was set up in 1995 to provide a voice for London’s Asian origin business community, which brings in approximately 60 billion British Pounds to the UK economy every year and accounts for nearly 13 per cent of the city’s annual turnover.
“We with the London Chamber of Commerce will continue to campaign for a freeze, and gradual reduction, in air passenger duty (APD) to put us on a level playing field with our competitors and European partners,” said ABA chairman Vijay Goel, in reference to a surcharge on air passengers from the UK.
“As an island economy dependent on air links, the UK should encourage, rather than penalise activity like air travel that connects people and markets enabling greater trade,” he added.
The leading NRI lawyer also wowed to continue to campaign for a liberalised immigration policy to secure a “practical policy that facilitates the passage of the highly skilled workers that London needs”.
“In a similar vein, we will lobby for changes to the UK visa regime to ensure that genuine businessmen and women – the very life-blood of the capital’s economy – can swiftly enter the UK to do business without enduring bureaucratic delays in processing or lengthy queues upon arrival at London airports,” Goel said.

Aurobindo Pharma set to acquire US nutritional supplements maker NatrolPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:31 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 4:19 pm
Aurobindo Pharma is all set to acquire troubled US-based nutritional supplement maker, Natrol Inc for USD 132.5 million (over Rs 810 crore) after emerging as the highest bidder for acquisition.
Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc, a subsidiary of the Hyderabad-based firm, has emerged as the highest bidder for acquisition of Natrol Inc and other affiliate entities, under a process to be finally approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
“Under the auction process, Aurobindo USA emerged as the highest and best bidder with a bid of USD 132.5 million to acquire the assets of Natrol with an agreement to take on certain liabilities,” Aurobindo Pharma said in a statement.
The buyout of Natrol would provide the right platform for creating a fully-integrated OTC platform in the US and other international markets, it added.
Natrol, which manufactures and sells nutritional supplements in US and other international markets, provides Aurobindo with strong brand reputation and presence in a variety of attractive supplement markets, it said.
“This acquisition is subject to final approval by the US court and other statutory approvals as may be required, including any termination of the waiting period or approval under the HSR Act, and closing conditions as per the Asset Purchase Agreement,” Aurobindo Pharma said.
Barclays acted as the sole financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as the legal counsel to Aurobindo USA, it added.
Aurobindo Pharma shares were trading at Rs 1,066 apiece on the BSE, up 3.69 per cent from its previous close.

Mumbai, Nov 12:  
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by nearly 99 points at 28,008.90 on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors despite weak global cues.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty ended higher by 20.65 points at 8,383.30.
Among BSE sectoral indices, auto and banking indices were the star-performers and were up 1.18 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.37 per cent, followed by metal 0.9 per cent, PSU 0.57 per cent and capital goods 0.53 per cent.
Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and ITC were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were Cipla, Tata Power, Tata Steel, NTPC and L&T.
The benchmark BSE Sensex surged 203.97 points or 0.73 per cent to trade at a new record-high of 28,114.03 in the morning session, breaking its previous peak of 28,027.96 reached on November 10.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade and hit a new life-time high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-share NSE index crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points or 0.53 per cent to trade at a life-time high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said that the domestic sentiment remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed the trading sentiment, they added.
A report by Equentis Capital said: "We expect markets likely to remain positive. Stay cautious and book profits on higher levels. The government will unveil IIP data for September 2014 and annual rate of inflation based on the combined consumer price indices (CPI) for urban and rural India for October 2014 on 12 November 2014. Inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for October 2014 will be released on 14 November 2014. Slower inflation could support regulators (RBI) to increase liquidity in the market in short-term and positive action by the regulators will be good for interest sensitive sectors/stocks."
European stocks
European shares and core bond yields fell on Wednesday, bucking a strong performance in Japan, with bank stocks under pressure following a landmark $3.4-billion settlement over allegations of price-fixing in currency markets.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 equity index was down 0.6 per cent at 0852 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 banks index was down more than 1 per cent.
Regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on UBS , Citigroup, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan.
Asian shares
Asian stocks extended their gains for the fourth day as Japanese shares climbed after the yen depreciated to a seven-year low amid speculation the nation will delay raising its sales tax again.
Japanese stocks scaled seven-year highs on Wednesday on growing expectations Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will postpone a planned sales tax hike to avoid damaging a fragile recovery, and call a snap election to bolster his political standing.
Nikkei 225 rose 73 points or 0.43 per cent at 17,197 and Hang Seng jumped 184.08 points or 0.77 per cent at 23,992.36.

Kapil Dev launches new app  SlopPho  underlining  Make in India  campaignInfosys founders, including Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
Donning the hat of a businessman and underlining Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ campaign, former cricketer and Indian captain Kapil Dev unveiled SlopPho — a social gamified collaboration platform on Wednesday.
“This social platform is truly for everyone and is our contribution to the Prime Minister’s Make in India initiative. Our aim is to take it to every smartphone user, corporate and professional in the country and then internationally by providing ease of use, accessibility on smartphone OS platform as well as availability in different languages. Since mobile is fast becoming the preferred mode of internet access, we built the final product as a mobile application. We believe the mobile application will help us achieve our target of atleast 5-6 million users and 25 large corporates in the first year,” Kapil said at the app launch.
The platform is targeted to engage users by allowing them to win prizes daily by participating in games, contests, polls and quizzes. “Participants also earn points that accumulate on a leaderboard and can eventually be redeemed or transferred/gifted as prizes or bartered for advertising space on the platform,”  Aman Sahani, CEO of SloPho said. The cumulative average daily prize money to be won ranges as much as R25,000 and will go up significantly during special promotions’ and festivals. Additionally, users have their own page where they can segment their followers into different customisable categories such as friends, family and colleagues among others; to share text, pictures and video. Users can also monetize their page by allowing advertising on it, a first in the world.
Further explaining the concept of SloPho, Kapil said that it was a platform that would not only serve castle gamers but would also let corporates and service providers gain benefits out of it. SloPho also allows businesses to target campaigns by region and language. Registered businesses (corporate, SMEs and self-employed entrepreneurs) will be able to put up gamified promotions directly and engage users around their brand and proposition to build long term communities. “The business can either put up contests on the main games feed page or create their own corporate/professional corner, which can be tailored to their specifications and managed directly. This also provides access to data and the benefit of analytics dashboard for their corner to get regular information around their campaigns,” Shailendra Haruray, director of marketing and sales at SloPho.
Further explaining the revenue model of SloPho, Shailendra said that the main revenue would be from registered corporates who are looking to advertise their products in an interactive manner. The second part of the income  would come from service providers who would be able to sell more data via more user interactions.
“Currently SloPho has 5 lakh users registered and there are expecting to reach the target of 50 lakh users within the next three months,” Kapil said. When asked about his decision to launch a digital venture, the former cricket star said, “I see Facebook, Twitter generating a lot of income and engaging users but these firms are not Indian so with the concept of developing something similar to them and from India we started this venture.” Also, Kapil revealed that he holds ‘a huge stake’ in the company but did not quote a figure. Revealing future plans for SloPho, he said that the app will be  launched in more scheduled Indian languages and will also be introduced internationally in United Arab Emirates and Africa. Outside of India, it will launched in partnership with the telecom ecosystem players like operators and handset vendors.
Asked about their marketing and growth strategy, Shailendra said that Slopho was looking to use a multi-pronged approach. Aprart from regular tools like advertising and CRM, it would try and get the registered corporates to advertise about the platform helping it get more traffic. The co-founders also didn’t give a figure for investments or estimates. “I would like to walk first before I start running so currently we will not speak about lofty targets,” Kapil said. Further explaining the reason for not giving up figures, one of the co-founders said that SloPho was in the middle of business discussions and revealing the figures could jeopardise them.
Though the company was silent on figures, it seems to have taken into account the fear of loss of privacy into account. A regular user is supposed to sign up using existing social media accounts or an e-mail and subscribe openly to corporates on the platform. “This roots out the problem Facebook has with the ‘like’. Our users are identifiable and there cannot be any corruption when it comes to data. The user has complete choice to unsubscribe the moment he wants,” Shailendra said. He added that this model would also authenticate the modus operandi of the firm by making it more transparent.

Phab-ulous face-off: 6 Plus vs Note 4‘Phab-ulous’ face-off: 6 Plus vs Note 4

Does Apple's biggest offering stand tall against Samsung’s latest phablet?
Before we start off with the review, let’s take a look at these facts – the Galaxy Note series has been around for nearly 4 years now. Over the years, it has evolved as one of the best devices that we would recommend for productivity, what with its stylus integration and all. Also, we firmly believed that the iPad has been the best device to roll out from the Cupertino giant’s lab. That is, until they made the iPad Mini. It brought the same cool features of the iOS ecosystem into a more compact package. Who wouldn’t love that?
Under normal circumstances, we usually avoid comparing an iOS device with an Android device in the same segment, for very simple reasons – they belong to different ecosystems and it’s quite like apples and oranges. But Apple has now given us enough reason to pit its latest, biggest iPhone against a device from its most obvious competitor.
At Technophile, we have been walking around with these two mammoth devices, and we used both simultaneously, for the same things.
Bigger is better?
Ever since we started hearing rumours of a phablet from Apple, we wondered if the company would carry the same brilliance in design with the new device as well. And it did not disappoint us. The most talked-about feature of the iPhone 6 Plus was that of its tendency to bend under pressure, and we’d like to add here that it may have been because the phone is so sleek. We love the way the vast expanse of aluminium feels when it sits in the palm. The screen falls gently over the edges, and it’s a great experience when you’re using one of the swiping gestures.
But there are certain things that do bother us. For starters, the curved edges look great but feel slippery . The volume rocker could have been moved a bit down too, for lefties and also for making clicking with the volume button easier. The long reach for the buttons dampens the experience. On the other hand, the Note 4 has come out looking much better than its predecessor, or any other Samsung device (apart from the new Alpha – that’s the best looking Samsung in our opinion). The device comes with machined aluminium around the sides, and that makes it look good and we also assume that it would soak up some impact around the corners (where the screen usually breaks) should you let this phablet slip out of your hand and on to the floor. But that doesn’t look likely, because the ergonomics are spot-on. Despite the flat back, it offers a better grip than the iPhone 6 Plus.
But while we’re at ergonomics, we think that Apple has done a great job with Reachability – a light double-tap on the Home button brings the upper half of the screen down, making one-handed usage come to you on demand and smoothly. With Samsung, activating the one-handed usage mode is quite a few taps and slides away.
The better workhorse?
Most of us know this already, but we’d still like to mention this before we dive right into the performance bit – with Apple, the OS is tailor made for the hardware, while with an Android device, a manufacturer has to depend on specs to get the best out of the operating system (if the version of Android is customised for a manufacturer). Hence, comparing the specs isn’t really something that we’d want to do. But what we do want to compare is the ease of usage, the ability to multitask and how productive the devices are.
Samsung here has the obvious advantage because it has been making the phablet for quite some time. The stylus integration is absolutely great, and you can be very productive with it. In fact, even an entire email can be written using the stylus, making us believe that the handwriting recognition has gotten better with increased precision of the S-Pen. Apart from Reachability, the Apple doesn’t really have any phablet-like software integration to boast of.
But what it does excel at is the marriage of hardware and software. Even though the Note 4 is one of the fastest Android devices around, iOS 8 feels absolutely brilliant in the multitasking and app-switching department. The gestures are smooth and we didn’t find a single reason to complain about the iPhone 6 Plus’s software performance. But that doesn’t mean that the Note 4 is a bad performer – we just think that the UI has become too boring now. Samsung should think of a new skin. Also, Samsung should stop giving the Indian market the Exynos processor – more cores do sound lucrative but then it already has the best Snapdragon processor for the other markets.
Both phones give a battery life of well over a day, but in our opinion the Note 4 has a better and more balanced battery life in our mixed usage pattern, which involves using a plethora of apps over both WiFi and cellular data. On some occasions the Note 4 could give a battery life of more than a day and a half.
Also, while the biometric sensor on the iPhone 6 Plus is faster and easier to use for unlocking, it’s sad that the security is enabled only for Apple Pay, while the Note 4 uses that for PayPal. Moreover, we wish Apple had given the NFC radio more functions. The Note 4 taps its way to brilliance with NFC accessories and in terms of sharing data easily.
Better entertainer?
Apart from productivity, the other reason why one should go for a phablet is because it has a bigger screen, and hence better for keeping oneself entertained. And in this area it’s a close call. The iPhone 6 Plus’s screen, though a lower resolution than the Note 4, has better colour reproduction and viewing angles, making it really brilliant for watching videos. The speakers on the 6 Plus are also way better than the Note 4’s.
The latter, however, is a much better device for gaming with its fast GPU and a Super AMOLED display. It also packs in more pixels per square inch, so if you’re a mobile gamer, you’ll love the Note 4.
The iPhone 6 Plus wins the camera fight hands-down. The iPhone 6 Plus’s 8MP shooter, thanks to a bigger sensor, captures way more light than the Note 4’s 13MP primary camera. On the iPhone, colour reproduction is just brilliant, and low light performance too is fantastic. We used the phones for the same shots, and realised that the Note 4 actually has a slightly less warm colour temperature.
Video shooting is also better on the iPhone 6 Plus, with a superior optical image stabilisation, and the 720p @ 240 fps video actually lets you slow down videos to watch in slow motion.
If you’re a fitness enthusiast, we’d recommend the Note 4 over the iPhone 6 Plus, because the data it records is exhaustive and it is much easier and user friendly to access the database. Also, the Note 4 can readily pair up with its own Samsung wearables in the market now.
Verdict
There’s no easy way to settle the argument about which is better, because both devices are quite different, despite the apparent similarity. After spending a lot of time with both phones we feel that the Note 4 is a dedicated phablet meant for productivity and for people who’d like to have a lot of creative control with a stylus. The S-Pen and its features are the best things Samsung has ever made for a mobile device.
The iPhone 6 Plus, on the other hand is a good device for those who would like to get the iOS 8 experience on a bigger screen. Sure, it isn’t as productive as the Note 4, but we reckon Apple never meant to do that. It’s also the first generation of a phablet from Apple. It’s a bigger iPhone. That’s what it is.

Traders forex chatroom banter exposedTraders’ forex chatroom banter exposed

The traders that attempted to manipulate the foreign exchange markets used chatrooms to share information about currency orders and gave themselves macho pseudonyms such as “The players”, “the A team” and “the 3 musketeers”, the UK financial watchdog’s investigation has revealed.
On Wednesday, the Financial Conduct Authority published chatroom messages showing how traders worked together to manipulate the benchmark, including “how can I make free money with no fcking heads up” [sic] and “cheers for saying you were same way helped me go early”.

Australian banks urged to boost capital
Other messages showed the traders’ fear of being found out: “[don’t] want other numpty’s in mkt to know [about information exchanged within the group] but not only that is he gonna protect us like we protect each other.”
The shared information allowed them to match up orders and align trading strategies at and around the fix. A fix is a benchmark rate based on trades taking place in a given time window; and certain fixings, especially the WM Reuters rate used in calculating key global bond and equity indices, are popular with asset managers who want to trade at the same rate used to value their portfolios.
Foreign exchange dealers usually quote two prices – for buying or selling a particular currency pair – making their money from the spread between the two rates. But banks offering a fixing service guarantee their clients the market mid-rate at this point in time. Traders with big orders to process therefore risk losing a significant amount if the market moves against them in the run-up to the fix – and the incentive to collude and try to make the exchange rate move in their favour is strong.
Citi
The FCA detailed one example of how some traders at Citi were able to manipulate the 1.15pm daily fix of exchange rates by the European Central Bank.
On the day in question, Citi had net buy orders of €200m and would benefit if it was able to move the ECB fix rate upwards.
Traders were able to “build” this order to €542m by using chatrooms to co-ordinate with traders at other firms who transferred their buy orders to Citi.
Furthermore, traders in a chatroom with net orders in the opposite direction to the desired movement at the fix sought to transact before the fix with traders outside the chatroom. The FCA said this practice was commonly referred to as “leaving you with the ammo”, building the volume of orders held by the traders in the chatroom in the desired direction and increasing their potential influence on the fix.
Having netted off its sell order with another party, one trader commented in the chatroom: “U shud be nice and clear to mangle”. The FCA said: “We read the word ‘mangle’ in this context as an attempt to manipulate the fix.”
More video
In the 15 seconds before the ECB fix, Citi placed four buy orders of increasing size and price which were priced at a level above the prevailing offer price. The FCA said Citi’s trading in this case generated a profit of $99,000.
After the fix, traders in the chatroom commented: “impressive”, “lovely” and “cnt teach that”.
HSBC
The FCA gave an example of how on one day it believed HSBC was involved in the manipulation of the 4pm WM/Reuters fix for the sterling-dollar rate. It allegedly colluded with traders from at least three other banks who, like it, were wanting to drive the rate lower.
From transcripts of chatroom conversations, about half an hour before the 4pm fix, a HSBC trader says “Let’s go”. Reply from Firm A: “yeah baby”, then: “hopefuulyl a fe wmore get same way and we can team whack it” [sic].
A trader from Firm D tells the trader from Firm A to “bask the fck out of it”.
Firm A then tells HSBC that a deal has been done with Firm E, which is buying. “Taken him out . . . so shud have iot rid of main buyer for u . . . im stilla seller of 90 . . . gives us a chance” [sic].

HSBC ended up selling £70m between 3.32pm and the start of the fix window. The FCA said these early trades were designed to take advantage of the expected downwards movement in the fix rate following the discussions within the chatroom.
In that time, the rate fell from $1.6044 to $1.6009.
HSBC then sold £311m during the fix window. HSBC and Firms A-C accounted for 63 per cent of the value of sales on the Reuters platform that day. The fix price was eventually $1.6003.
After the fix the traders said the following in the chatroom:
“Nice work gent . . . I don my hat”, “dont mess with our ccy [currency]”, “loved that mate . . . worked lovely . . . pity we coldn’t get it below the 00” and “we need a few more of those for me to get back on track this month”.
HSBC’s profit in this trade was $162,000, the FCA said.
JPMorgan
The FCA gave an example of a day when it says JPMorgan attempted to manipulate the 4pm WMR euro-dollar fix rate.
JPMorgan had net buy orders of €105m and wanted to move the fix rate up.
In a chatroom conversation, it offers to transfer this order to Firm A. Firm A says “maybe”. Firm A is buying €150m at the fix “for a top [account]”, adding “i’d prefer we join forces”. JPMorgan replies “perfick . . . lets do this . . . lets double team em”. Firm A replies “YESsssssss”. Later Firm A says to JPMorgan; “I got the bookies covered”, referring to dealers in the interdealer broker market.
By the fix, JPMorgan had built orders of €278m while Firm A’s orders were €240m.
We were EPIC at the fix yest
- Firm A
JPMorgan bought €57m in the two minutes before the fix window. The FCA said these trades were designed to take advantage of the expected upwards movement in the fix rate following the discussions within the chatroom.
During the fix window, JPMorgan bought €134m and Firm A bought €125m. Between them they accounted for 41 per cent of the euro-dollar trade.
‘So couldnt have been that $hit a week!!
- Firm B
JPMorgan’s profit in this trade was $33,000.
RBS
The FCA used an example of RBS attempting to manipulate the WMR GBP/USD fix on a day when it had net client sell orders at the fix and would benefit if it was able to manipulate the WMR fix rate lower.
Ahead of the fix, RBS shared information with other traders in the chatroom causing two of them to “net off” their buying and selling orders. Another firm responds by netting off part of its sell order with two other parties outside the chatroom.
The FCA said this practice was known as “clearing the decks” as traders netted off their orders with third parties outside the chatroom reducing the volume of orders that might otherwise be transacted at the fix in the opposite direction.
In a separate chatroom, RBS told three other traders: “We getting a lot Betty at fix” which the FCA said was trader slang for sterling/dollar, coming from “Betty Grable” which rhymes with “cable”.
‘We fooking killed it right’
- Trader
In the period leading up to the 4pm fix, RBS built the volume of currency it sold to £399m which the FCA said “was designed to take advantage of the expected downwards movement in the fix rate following the discussions within the chatroom”.
The FCA said that RBS made $615,000 profit on this trade.
UBS
The FCA gave an example of an occasion when it says UBS attempted to manipulate the 1.15pm ECB euro-dollar fix. UBS was a net seller and wanted to move the rate lower.
Ahead of the fix UBS had net sell orders of €250m, Firm A was selling €200m, while Firm B was selling €100m. Firm A’s order’s dropped to €100m but it said “hopefully taking all the filth out for u . . .”, meaning it had netted off some of its orders with people who might have traded against UBS.
Firm A and UBS then said they had done short trades, each of €25m. Firm B then indicated that these short positions should be held for only 12 minutes, i.e until the ECB fix.
Firm A says it is now selling €50m at the fix. “I getting chipped away at a load of bank filth for the fix . . . back to bully [meaning €50m] . . . hopefully decks a bit cleaner”.
By the fix, UBS had sell orders of €200m and had increased its short position to €50m. Firm B had a short position of €50m. Firm C, a buyer, netted off with Firm A and Firm B, leaving it with €10m to buy at the fix.
Firm B then advised Firm C to “go late”, when the rate will be lower. Firm B copied into the chat a note from UBS, which said an earlier fix was “the best fix of my ubs career . . .” Firm B then added: “challenge”. Firm C replied “stars aligned”.
UBS’s net sell orders were €211m at the time of the fix.
At 13.14.59 UBS placed an offer to sell €100m at 1.3092, 3 basis points below the prevailing best bid. The ECB subsequently published the fix rate for euro-dollar at 1.3092. UBS’s order accounted for 29 per cent of the orders at the 1.15pm fix.
UBS’s trading in this example generated a profit of $513,000.
.............................................
In the US, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also published transcripts from chatroom conversations between traders:
Three traders from Citi, JPMorgan and UBS discuss whether to invite a fourth into their private chatroom:
“Will he tell rest of desk stuff . . . or god forbid his nyk [New York office],” one trader asks. “That’s really imp[ortant] q[uestion],” another trader responds, adding: “dont want other numpty’s in mkt to know [sic] . . . is he gonna protect us like we protect each other against our own branches?”
A trader from HSBC visits multiple chatrooms in an attempt to manipulate the 4pm WMR fix, declaring he is a net seller in “cable” (a slang term for GBP/USD currency pairing):
“Hopefully a [few] more get same way and we can team whack it,” one trader responds. “ill do some digging”, says another prompting others to disclose their positions.
Simultaneously, in a separate private chatroom, the same HSBC trader informs other traders they should buy “cable” at the fix:
“Get lumpy cable at the fix ok” he said. A second trader replied “ta mate”. As the 4pm fix period closes, the HSBC trader comments: “I sold a lot up there and over sold by 100 hahaha”.
In another private chatroom, the HSBC trader discloses his position with traders at other banks before the closure of the fix period. The traders then share information about the size and direction of the orders at the fix period:
“You getting betty [Betty Grable, rhyming slang for cable] on the mumble still? We have nowt,” one trader asks. He then says: “Get it up to 60/70 then bash the fck out of it”.
Traders from Citi and JPMorgan co-ordinate within a private chatroom in an attempt to manipulate the EUR/USD fix:
“OK, I got a lot of euros,” says the first trader. A second trader responds: “ill take it if u dont want it”. The first trader replies: “lets double team it . . . how much u got?” and they jointly agree a trading strategy. Just after the 4pm fix, the first trader reported he was “hosed” and the second trader responded “ditto”.
Traders from UBS share their “scores” in a private chatroom:
Traders from UBS and three other banks exchanged their positions leading into the WMR 4pm fix. Once all four determined they were going to be trading in the same direction, one asked if “we gonna be able to get it to 05” to which another responded: “is that the royal fkn we?”. After the fixing window had closed, the chatroom members gave their “scores” or profits from the fix each claiming they made between $60,000 and $220,000 prompting one to add: “nice call”.

Indian Oil LNG terminal to be ready by 2017-18logistics
The investment in Joint Venture project is Rs.5,150 crore
Indian Oil Corporation’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal and also the first one on the east coast at Kamarajar Port will become operational by the third quarter of 2017 or early 2018.
Briefing reporters here on Wednesday, IOC chairman B. Ashok said the company was setting up a five million-tonne LNG terminal with storage and re-gassification facilities at Ennore. The board had already given its nod for the project a month ago, he said. Civil works would begin soon.
The Rs.5,150-crore project is developed jointly by IOC and Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation. IOC has 45 per cent stake and the latter five per cent. On the status of the LNG project, he said: “We received statutory approvals and land has been approved. The project management consultant is in place. Contracts have been finalised. We will start the project very soon. The implementation of the project will provide access to natural gas in this part of the country. It will play a crucial role in the economic development and in city gas distribution.”
To a query on the sourcing of LNG, Mr. Ashok said 1.2 million tonnes of would be sourced from a project in British Columbia, Canada, where the company has invested $4 billion for a 10 per cent stake. About 0.7 million tonnes would be sourced from the Cameron project in U.S. On the greenfield refinery at Paradip, he said that IOC had completed more than 97 per cent of the work. The first unit would be commissioned by February/March 2015, he added. Besides, IOC was evaluating the possibility of setting up a pipeline from Paradip to Visakhapatnam that would connect Hyderabad too.
IOC had planned to invest Rs.750 crore in Tamil Nadu during the current year out of which, Rs.550 crore had been spent towards automation and augmentation of existing facilities, he said.
On the merger of Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd. with IOC, he said it could be done only after solving certain issues. The crucial issue pertained to Naftiran Intertrade Company Ltd., holding 15.40 per cent stake in CPCL.
Asked about the demand by fertilizer firms for a reduction in supply price of naphtha, he said IOC exported naphtha only when there was a demand for it. “We will stop exporting naphtha, if domestic firms ask for it,” he said.
We’ll take appropriate decision, IOC chief
Indian Oil Corporation has not received any communication from the government about the capping of budget subsidy on cooking gas at Rs.20/kg., according to the company’s Chairman B. Ashok.
Asked about the possibility of an increase in the price of cooking gas cylinders consequent to the government’s decision, Mr. Ashok pointed out that LPG prices were falling in global markets.
“We’ll take an appropriate decision taking into account all factors,” was his answer when asked what the company would do if global prices were to increase.

Retail inflation drops to 5.5 per cent in OctNEW DELHI, November 12, 2014

Retail inflation drops to 5.5 per cent in Oct
PTI
inflation and deflation
Helped by softening prices of food items, the retail inflation declined to 5.52 per cent in October, the lowest since the new series of data was introduced in January 2012. This is the fourth consecutive month of decline in the Consumer Price Index based inflation or retail inflation, which had fallen to 6.46 per cent in the previous month.
The overall food inflation measured on CPI came down to 5.59 per cent in October against 7.67 per cent in the previous month.
Retail prices of vegetables declined by 1.45 per cent against a rise of 8.59 per cent in September, according the data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
Inflation in fruits slowed to 17.49 per cent from 22.4 per cent in September. Similarly the rate of price rise in protein rich items like eggs, fish and meat was at 6.34 per cent in October, slightly down from 6.35 per cent in the previous month.
The data on inflation based on Wholesale Price Index for October will be released on Friday. WPI inflation had dropped to a near five-year low in September to 2.38 per cent, helped by moderation in food and fuel prices.
RBI has started targeting retail inflation, while deciding on its bi-monthly monetary policy.
RBI has been targeting a retail inflation of 8 per cent by March 2015 and 6 per cent by March 2016. Retail inflation in cereals and products also came down to 6 per cent in October from 6.42 per cent in the previous month.

Referrals may go up after RBI forbearance ends in March  says RK Bansal  Chairman CDRCONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
With the Reserve Bank of India’s forbearance on classification of restructured assets as standard ending in March, Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) cell chairman RK Bansal says referrals may go up in Q4FY15. In an interview with Shayan Ghosh, Bansal talks about failed CDR cases and how RBI’s new stressed asset guidelines have lowered the referrals. Excerpts:
Referrals to the CDR cell came down in the first half of FY15. What were the reasons?
In the first quarter, while two cases were referred to us, we approved 10 cases pending from the previous year. That happened because of the RBI’s JLF system. There was also a new concept of an independent evaluation committee (IEC) — even that took some time. In the second quarter, about 14 cases were referred to us and we managed to approve 19. In the third quarter, I expect lower referrals. But in the fourth quarter, the number may go up after RBI ends its forbearance on restructured assets’ classification as standard.
With some large cases failing in FY15, do you expect the trend to continue?
So far, we have approved 505 cases worth over Rs 3 lakh crore, of which about 144 failed, accounting for about 28% of the number of cases approved. However, this number may be misleading, as cases with relatively smaller amount have a greater tendency to fail. If we look at the quantum of the failure in absolute terms, it comes to around 13%. The failure was hardly 10% at the end of FY14, but the exit of three large cases in shipping, hotel and steel sectors suddenly changed the equation.
Even though there are different reasons for each case to fail, I do not agree with the view that the rate of failures has increased. What has happened is that due to exit of these three large accounts, unsuccessful exits as a part of approved cases have gone up. A successful exit from CDR can happen only after 7-8 years and you cannot really call those cases a failure that occur within two years of approval.
Most recast cases in the first half of this fiscal were in the range of Rs 1,000-1,500 crore. This was much smaller compared to previous years…
First, Rs 1,500 crore is not a small exposure. Secondly, there were only a few large cases last year. Actually, the normal size of CDR cases is between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 2,000 crore. However, most of the EPC companies that came to CDR had slightly larger limits because of non-fund-based exposures. Most of the non-fund-based limits got converted into fund-based due to invocation of guarantees by some entities and letter of credit (LoC) devolvements, making the exposure larger. Therefore, if a company has Rs 2,000-crore fund-based limit and Rs 5,000-crore non-fund-based limit, the exposure will be counted as Rs 7,000 crore.
What kind of CDR approvals do you expect in FY15?
We certainly expect lesser number of approvals this year. Last year was the peak of approvals. So far this year, the figures are less, but we need to keep an eye on a few things. First, because of the new JLF system, which allows rectification of an account, banks are aware of stress in the cases at a much advanced stage and are able to take corrective action. Second, perhaps most companies that were required to come to CDR have already come. With the government taking policy decisions, things are likely to improve now and companies will be able to manage without restructuring. However, even after the RBI forbearance on classification of restructured assets ends in March, recasts will keep happening. This is because if you have to protect the value of an asset, there is no other way than restructuring in our system. The option of recovery is not an option at all since the legal system takes too long.

Analyst corner: Reduce Cummins on subdued margin growthexpectationsONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
We maintain ‘reduce’ rating on Cummins India with a revised target price of R720 per share (earlier R640) as we roll-forward to September 2016e earnings of 19x. We build in higher export-growth estimates and related moderation in margin improvement. We revise our estimates to R26.7 (vs 27.5), R32.6 (vs 31.8) and R43.7 (vs Rs 39.9) for FY15-17, respectively. We build in the benefit of stronger export growth (for mid-range HP units). Related tax benefit (30-35% of overall from SEZ facility) is partly negated by lower margins and higher working capital for exports (as seen in Q2FY15).
Sequentially, export growth of 24% to R480 crore was driven by a one-time R50 crore order from China. Adjusted, the sequential growth was about 12%, driven by low HP and mid-range sales. Growth potential for the segment is strong in all three segments – low-HP export run-rate is expected to grow 3-4x over the next three years, high-HP exports are growing (bottomed out a year ago) and potential scale-up of mid-range HP exports will possibly start from early CY15. We believe this can drive 40-45% revenue CAGR for exports over FY14-17e.
Cummins said it expects the recovery to be more linked with an increase in capital formation, which it expects will take place in early FY16. The government’s focus on making India a manufacturing hub is expected to support Cummins’ long-term growth potential. For FY15 it has maintained its 0-5% growth guidance.

Analyst corner: Buy DCB Bank on steadyperformanceONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
We maintain ‘buy’ on DCB Bank with target price of R102 (earlier R94), assigning 1.7x FY16e adjusted book value (ABV). Withstanding challenges, DCB Bank has made a remarkable turnaround and is well-placed to deliver steady performance. The stack is trading at 1.6x FY16 ABV.
DCB Bank’s loan growth picked up to 31% y-o-y in Q2FY15 as it gained traction in corporate banking (up 33% y-o-y, 5.2% q-o-q). This was further aided by healthy growth in retail segment (up 35% y-o-y, 13% q-o-q) and agri (up 78% y-o-y, albeit down q-o-q given higher base in Q1FY15). Retail growth was driven by healthy growth in mortgage segment (up 35% y-o-y, 10.4% q-o-q—more tilted towards LAP portfolio).
Management continued to maintain a cautious stance on SME book due to stress in this segment. Hence, the bank continued with its strategy of focusing on small-ticket loans, leading to a flat SME book.
The bank continued to report healthy NIMs at 3.72%, largely drawing support from 6 bps q-o-q improvement in funding cost (7.73%) which offset the 24 bps decline in lending yields. During the quarter, DCB Bank used excess SLR investment to support the lending requirement, reflected in CD ratio inching up to 81% from 79% in previous quarter. Going forward, management expects slight pressure on NIMs from current level.

Deposit growth sluggish at 12%  non-food credit rises11.27%ONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
Deposits in the banking system recorded a growth of just 11.96% y-o-y to Rs 82,76,945 crore for the fortnight ended October 31, according to RBI data. While time deposits grew 11.11% y-o-y to Rs 75,19,415 crore, demand deposits were up 13.12% y-o-y at Rs 7,43,760 crore.
Meanwhile, non-food credit — or loans to companies and individuals — grew 11.27 % y-o-y to Rs 61,63,646 crore for the fortnight ended October 31.
For the 14-day period ended October 17, non-food credit growth came in at 11.16% y-o-y at Rs 55,391.33 crore.
Credit growth, which had plummeted to a decade low of 9.8% in the fortnight ended September 5, appears to be picking up in what is typically a busy season. Bankers said they were now trying to grow their books by focusing on retail loans as there were few projects taking off.
Retail credit has been growing although the festive season didn’t really see a big spurt in demand.
Corporates have been tapping other means of cheaper funds, such as bonds and commercial papers. While base rates of most public sector banks are in the 10.00-10.25%-band, AAA-rated firms can raise 10-year bonds at 9.40-9.60%.
Credit demand in 2013 had increased in August and September as the RBI had taken extraordinary liquidity tightening measures in July to stem the slide of rupee, which had hit a lifetime low of Rs 68.825 in August.

IPOs worth R7 000 cr waiting to hitmarketsONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
With several mid-sized companies successfully raising funds and a paradigm shift in Indian polity taking shape, more and more firms are looking to tap the primary market.
More than R7,000 crore worth of fresh paper is waiting to hit the markets, shows a compilation by Prime Database.
Seven companies already have the requisite approval from Sebi with a potential to raise nearly R3,000 crore. An additional 12-15 companies have either filed their drafts with Sebi or propose to tap the capital markets. These companies have the potential to raise an estimated R4,500 crore in total, data show.
Offers of four companies — Sharda Cropchem (R351 crore), Snowman Logistics (R197 crore), Wonderla Holidays (R181 crore) and Shemaroo Entertainment (R120 crore) — were subscribed multiple times in the first six months of the current fiscal.
Investment bankers said the ‘business-friendly’ tag of the new government are prompting many companies to go in for capacity expansion as well as debt reduction. More companies will follow suit with a potential to raise another R5,000-6,000 crore in the next one year, said investment bankers.
“I think everyone was waiting for the elections. I believe there will be a flurry of activity in the IPO market. Elections played a big role,” said Ajay Saraf of ICICI Securities. “During a bull market, interest levels of investors is far higher and they look at a wider landscape, or companies and sectors… You will see more issuances as markets pick-up,” said Indraneil Borkakoty, MD, IDFC Investment Banking.

Markets at new highs as FIIs again buy into IndiastoryONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
India may be an expensive market but foreign investors are willing to buy into it. Convinced the BJP-led NDA government will deliver on reforms in an economy that’s benefiting from lower crude oil prices, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) drove up Indian benchmark indices to new lifetime highs on Wednesday with the Nifty edging past the 8,400-point mark. The Sensex and Nifty have outperformed all major world indices so far in 2014 with dollar gains of 33% in a global rally fuelled by an abundance of liquidity resulting from accommodative policies of central banks.
With purchases of of a provisional $75 million on Wednesday, foreign funds have now run up a tab for the year of a shade above$15 billion. Investors believe the government will continue to usher in changes that will help jump-start growth. “We expect the Modi government to capitalise on an approaching 11-month election-free window to move ahead decisively on its reform agenda,” Deutsche Bank said in a recent report, predicting the Sensex at 29,000 by the end of the current fiscal.
India’s valuations — close to 20 time on a trailing basis — are expected to sustain as the economy recovers. “The economic growth recovery under way will likely sustain current valuations, especially as it starts manifesting in both macro and micro data points. Unlike the last three years, we expect consensus earnings growth estimates of 15%+ for FY16 and FY17 to be met, and ultimately, it is earnings momentum that drives markets,” UBS wrote in a recent report. India is now the second most expensive market among its emerging market peers.
On Wednesday, the Sensex hit an intra-day high of 28,126.48 points for the first time, closing 0.35% higher at 28,008.90 points. The broader 50-scrip Nifty closed 0.25% higher at 8,383.30 points after hitting an intra-day high of 8,415.05. According to UBS, Nifty could scale the 9,600-mark by the end of the current fiscal.
On Wednesday, most Asian markets ended higher. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.43% higher to a seven-year high. Asian stocks advanced 0.2-1%. European stocks were trading lower.
The DAX (1.37%), CAC (-1.09%) and FTSE 100 (-0.35%) were trading in the red at 7.20 pm IST.
The rally in India had lost some steam in recent months with the Sensex gaining just 5.15% since September as against a 12% surge since the election results were announced in mid-May. Investors are expecting a fruitful session of Parliament which begins on November 24. Among the Bills that could be introduced, debated or passed are the insurance amendment Bill, the constitutional amendment Bill for GST, and amendments to the land and labour Bills.

By Pavel Polityuk and Anton Zverev
KIEV/DONETSK, Ukraine, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Wednesday it was redeploying troops in the east because of fears separatists will launch a new military offensive, despite Russia's denials it has sent troops to reinforce the rebels.
A ceasefire agreed by the pro-Russian rebels and government forces more than two months ago is now all but dead, and Western fears of a return to all-out conflict are growing.
U.S. General Philip Breedlove, NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said the alliance had seen Russian troops and tanks entering Ukraine in the past few days, confirming reports by international observers.
"There is no question any more about Russia's direct military involvement in Ukraine," Breedlove said in Bulgaria.
A Russian Defense Ministry official, General-Major Igor Konashenkov, said in Moscow "there were and are no facts" behind such statements and Russia had given up paying attention to such accusations by NATO.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak left no doubt that Kiev was also no longer paying attention to Moscow's denials of providing the rebels with direct military support in the worst diplomatic standoff with the West since the Cold War.
"We are repositioning our armed forces to respond to the actions of the (rebel) fighters," Poltorak told a government meeting in Kiev. "I see my main task is to prepare for military action."
He gave no details of the troop movements.
The Sept. 5 ceasefire followed weeks of fierce fighting between government forces and separatists who rebelled in mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine against the rule of Kiev's Western-looking government eight months ago.
The truce has been violated daily, and increasingly since the rebels held what the West and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said were illegitimate leadership elections on Nov. 2. The death toll has passed 4,000 since the truce was agreed, with Kiev accusing Moscow of sending more troops last week.
THREAT TO PEACE
"Russia's actions represent a clear decision by Moscow to reject the international principles that have shaped international security for over 25 years, the foundation for a Europe that is a whole free and at peace," Breedlove said.
President Vladimir Putin has bit back by accusing the West of instigating the coup that ousted a Moscow-backed president in Kiev in February after months of street protests, and of trying to use the crisis to prevent Russia's rise as a global power.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry by phone that the ceasefire deal must be upheld, rejecting accusations that Moscow is to blame for its collapse.
A Reuters reporter, however, saw unidentified military trucks in the center of Donetsk on Wednesday, with soldiers in green uniform without insignia standing nearby. Russian soldiers spotted by local residents have often worn no insignia.
Kiev's fear is that Putin, who annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in March, now wants to expand the territory controlled by the separatists with another military push like one that turned the tide in the rebels' favor in August.
Russia denied sending in troops and armor in August but said some Russians may have been there as volunteers during their holidays, and a large number of Russian soldiers are among the dead in the conflict.
The prospect of all-out war returning to eastern Ukraine has piled pressure on the country's struggling economy, sending the hryvnia currency plummeting.
The cost of insuring exposure to Ukraine's debt hit five-year highs on Wednesday, while its dollar bonds also sold off heavily.
Russia is also suffering an economic downturn aggravated by Western economic sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, with the rouble falling nearly 30 percent against the U.S. dollar this year.
But Putin has shown no sign of changing policy on Ukraine and the EU has signaled it will not ease sanctions on Russia when it meets to discuss them next week.

Bharti cancels Loop Mobile acquisition  a Credit Negative: Moody s Investors ServiceBharti cancels Loop Mobile acquisition, a Credit Negative: Moody's Investors Service
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 13, 2014 10:28 IST
The cancellation is credit negative for Bharti because the integrated telecommunications company will not receive the market-share boost that Loop would have provided in Mumbai, India, or the anticipated increase in average revenue per user for that circle from Loop's more profitable post-paid customer base.
 
 
Last Thursday, Bharti Airtel Ltd. (Baa3 stable) announced that it had cancelled its deal to acquire Indian mobile operator Loop Mobile (unrated). The cancellation is credit negative for Bharti because the integrated telecommunications company will not receive the market-share boost that Loop would have provided in Mumbai, India, or the anticipated increase in average revenue per user for that circle from Loop's more profitable post-paid customer base.
When Bharti announced in February its plan to acquire Loop for INR700 crore ($114 million), Loop had a subscriber base of about 3 million in Mumbai. Its subscriber base also had a high proportion of post-paid subscribers, who have service contracts and are more profitable than customers who prepay for mobile phone use. Adding Loop's subscribers to Bharti's 4 million subscribers in the Mumbai metro area would have catapulted Bharti to the No. 1 market position by customers in this key market, ahead of Vodafone India (unrated). Loop also has tower rights in key geographic areas. Acquiring Loop would have strengthened Bharti's network coverage and overall blended average revenues per user.
However, the definitive agreement that the two companies signed in June was conditioned upon regulatory approval by 30 October. Not having received the India Department of Telecommunications' (DoT) and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (TRAI) approvals by the agreed date, the companies abandoned the agreement.
DoT and the TRAI objected to the migration of Loop's subscribers to Bharti on the grounds that the compulsory transfer of customers would break mobile number portability (MNP) rules, which advocate voluntary migration. (Bharti continues to benefit from customers porting to its network via the available
MNP route.) Additionally, the regulators said the transfer would cause a revenue loss for the government because the users would not be paying the INR19 fee to change operators, as stipulated under the MNP rules.
Amid these regulatory hurdles and ahead of Loop's mobile license expiration on 29 November, Loop'scustomer base eroded considerably to around 1.2 million subscribers in October from 3 million in February 2014 as subscribers moved to Vodafone India, Bharti and Idea Cellular (unrated). In contrast to Loop's small and eroding market share, the New Delhi, India-based Bharti had more than 212 million mobile subscribers across India as of 30 September and 79 million mobile subscribers in Africa and South Asia, making it the world's fourth-largest mobile operator based on total number of subscribers. In the Mumbai circle specifically, Bharti ranks as the third-largest operator (16% wireless subscriber market share), behind Vodafone (27%) and Reliance (20%).
We do not expect the cancelled deal to have a material adverse effect on Bharti's cash flow generation capabilities over the next quarters. Furthermore, the cancellation will not affect any spectrum holding that Bharti has in the Mumbai circle. In auctions that concluded in February 2014, Bharti won five megahertz of the 900-megahertz spectrum, which we expect will boost its voice and data capabilities in Mumbai. We expect Bharti to continue benefitting from its improved spectrum holding. Earlier, Bharti had only 9.2 megahertz of the 1800-megahertz spectrum in Mumbai.
The cancellation of the acquisition also illustrates the significant barriers the Indian telecommunicationsindustry must surpass to achieve a more efficient operating environment in an industry ripe for consolidation and in need of proper exit procedures for failing companies.

Hyderabad, Nov 13:  
Honda Cars India Ltd is on a major dealership expansion drive. The company today opened its 200th in India and announced plans to open 100 more dealerships by March 2016.
After inaugurating Metro Honda here, Hironori Kanayama, President and CEO, Honda Cars India, said that they hope that solid growth will take their sales volume past the 3,00,000 mark by March 2017.
He said the company is aggressively expanding its network by focusing on existing and newer Tier III markets.
With the new dealership, Honda Cars India now has a network of 200 facilities in 130 cities in the country. The company aims at expanding its dealership network by 35 per cent during FY 2014-15 and take the number of dealerships to 230 in 150 cities by March 2015.
Backed by strong demand for cars like Honda City, Honda Amaze and the recently launched Honda Mobilio, Honda Cars India registered an overall growth of 43 per cent during April-October with 1,01,442 units against 70,831 units during the corresponding period last year.
To cater to the robust demand from Amaze, City and Mobilio, Honda may consider delaying the launch of Jazz slightly, it said.

Nay Pyi Taw, Nov 13:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asserted that the world community must reject any linkage between religion and terrorism while formulating a “genuinely international” partnership in the fight against all forms of terror acts.
In his intervention at the East Asia Summit, the Prime Minister also said that it should be ensured that cyber and space remain a source of connectivity and prosperity, and not new theatres of conflict.
Leaders of 18 countries, including US President Barack Obama and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, assembled at the one-day ninth East Asian Summit here in the Myanmarese capital.
“We support the East Asia Summit Declaration on the Islamic State (terror group). At the same time, comprehensive response against terrorism requires a genuinely international partnership against all terrorism. Those who believe in humanity must come together. We should also reject any linkage between religion and terrorism,” he said.
“Challenges of terrorism and extremism have increased.
There is close link with drug trafficking, arms smuggling and money laundering,” he added.
Economic partnership agreement
On economic issues, Modi pushed for a “balanced” Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which gives equal emphasis to goods and services, saying this could become a “springboard” for regional integration and prosperity.
Modi also conveyed India’s best wishes for the goal of creating an ASEAN Community in 2015.
“ASEAN’s success is an inspiration for broader integration in the Asia-Pacific region. India has great confidence in Asian centrality and leadership in pursuing that goal,” he added.

Global gold demand falls to near 5-year low in Q3: WGCGlobal gold demand falls to near 5-year low in Q3: WGC
Reuters
Tweet
London, Nov 13:  
Global gold demand fell to its lowest in nearly five years in the third quarter as Chinese buying slid by a third, the World Gold Council said on Thursday, putting it back behind India as the world’s biggest gold consumer.
Total gold demand fell 2 per cent to 929 tonnes in the third quarter, the data, prepared in conjunction with GFMS analysts at Thomson Reuters, showed.
That is the lowest since the last three months of 2009. Last year’s number one consumer China saw a 39 per cent drop in jewellery consumption as well as a 30 per cent fall in bar and coin investment. Combined demand fell 37 per cent.
India pips China
India once again took over as the world’s biggest gold consumer, buying 225.1 tonnes of gold jewellery, coins and bars last quarter compared with 182.7 tonnes in China.
India, which lost its crown as the leading gold buyer to China in 2011, saw a 60 per cent surge in jewellery demand in the third quarter.
“Our forecast for the full year is the same for both India and China. We expect demand in both to come in at between 850-950 tonnes,’’ Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, said.
“Both remain very positive pillars of gold demand.’’
Lehman Brothers crisis
Demand for gold snowballed in the wake of the financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, as investors sought the metal as a portfolio diversifier and safe store of value.
It peaked in 2011 at 4,702 tonnes, but had fallen to 4,080 tonnes by last year. Prices, which crashed 28 per cent last year, have fallen another 3.3 per cent in 2014.
Demand to stabilise
This year, WGC expects gold demand to stabilise. “We expect gold demand to be largely similar to last year, at between 4,000 and 4,100 tonnes,’’ said Hewitt.
The third quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of outflows from exchange-traded funds. Holdings of the vehicles, which issue securities backed by physical gold, fell 41.3 tonnes last quarter, the data showed.
Global demand for gold jewellery, the biggest single area of consumption, fell 4 per cent to 534 tonnes. Among supply sources, mine production rose 1 per cent to 812 tonnes, while scrap supply fell 25 per cent to 250.5 tonnes. Year to date, 2014 has seen the lowest level of recycling since 2007, the WGC said.

Why are markets rising 4 key factsONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
Domestic markets crossed yet another milestone on Wednesday with the benchmark BSE Sensex settling above the 28,000 level for the first time and the NSE Nifty crossing the 8,400 level on rate cut expectations in the wake of the sustained fall in inflation and crude oil prices.
The Sensex has increased 32 per cent this year, the best performer among the world’s 30 biggest markets, and is valued at 15.6 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s multiple of 11. Foreign investors brought a net $98 million on Tuesday.
But why are the markets rising? Here are some pointers:
1. Expectations that easing inflation would prompt the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates earlier than expected
2. Brent crude falls below $81 per barrel, its four-year low, on oil glut worries
3. Expectations that the government will initiate more economic reforms
4.  Sustained foreign investment inflows

Indias gold demand surges 39 per cent to 225.1 tonnes in Q3:WGCGold futures price falls on global cues
India’s gold demand during July-September quarter this year shot up by 39 per cent to 225.1 tonnes against the overall third quarter demand in 2013 on rise in jewellery sales, says a World Gold Council report.
The overall third quarter demand in the country for 2013 stood at 161.6 tonnes, WGC Gold Demand Trends report showed.
Gold demand during the period in terms of value rose by 31 per cent to Rs 56,219.3 crore as compared to Rs 42,829.6 crore in the third quarter of 2013.
Similarly, the total jewellery demand was up by 60 per cent at 182.9 tonnes as against 114.5 tonnes in the same period last year.
The value of jewellery demand surged by 51 per cent to Rs 45,681.6 crore from Rs 30,346.5 crore in the third quarter of 2013.
“The rise in demand for gold jewellery during third quarter of 2014 reflects the unusual low base of third quarter of 2013 that was impacted by the introduction of a range of duty increases and restrictions.
“The third quarter can be viewed as normal for gold demand in spite of the unfulfilled expectations of a duty cut and policy relaxations from the new government,” WGC Managing Director (India) Somasundaram PR said here.
He further said that demand around Diwali reflected the general optimism seen in the country.
“It is now beyond debate that import restrictions have had little impact on demand for gold and yet have strengthened the unauthorised supply channels and seems at odds with the overall sentiment that defines the new government’s business approach,” he added.

Lava QPAD R704 review: The right mixInfosys founders, including Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
Tablets first debuted in 2010 with the launch of the first Apple iPad. Since then, Google’s Android operating system-based slates have decisively taken over from laptops and smartphones as the preferred device for entertainment and productivity.
The increase in tablet  usage is also reflected in the rapid growth of existing and rise of new device firms as well. Take for instance, Lava International; it has virtually stormed the tablet segment with its slim, fast and easy-to-use devices that deliver effortless performance for work and play. Their new offering, QPAD R704, was sent to us for a product evaluation.
It is an Android tablet, competitively priced at Rs 8,499 and rightly built for today’s digitally-savvy generation. It is targeted at young working professionals, students in professional courses and enterprise segment.
Let us check  its features and performance.
For starters, the QPAD R704 is an inexpensive 7-inch Android tablet with a premium feel. It is a combination of dexterous and power-packed performance with Quad Core processor and plenty of interesting features that promises to enhance every user experience. In terms of design, this Lava slate comes in an attractive design paired with the metallic brushed body embodied in a sleek frame, which not only feels great in hands but also gives it an extremely classy look.
Company officials claim that the QPAD R704 fulfills the core requirements of the users by offering them a seamless experience in entertainment, emails, presentations, application surfing, web browsing and a longer usage time through its optimised power management. The tablet takes the legacy of E704 one step ahead by bringing together a superior computing experience and brilliant graphics through its IPS display with HD capabilities.
Probing its innards, the QPAD R704 is powered by 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon Quad Core processor and supports single SIM 3G voice and video calls, along with data access providing consumers with 3G connectivity on the go. The tablet is also equipped with high efficiency video coding (HEVC) which provides improved video quality support for higher resolution videos and Snapdragon Audio for rich 3D surround sound and pretty decent audio performance. R704 also features Qualcomm Interference Cancellation and Equalisation (Q-ICE) feature that enriches the network capacity by reducing the noise in the cellular network and enhances the mobile broadband user experience.
Using Android Jellybean v4.3 operating system, this tablet comes with a 7-inch multi-touch WSVGA IPS display to ensure the product is ideal for work and entertainment purpose. The IPS display gives pretty good viewing and gaming experience from all viewing angles. I feel that the IPS screen gives the ease of using and holding the tablet in any angle for clear viewing.
Moving further, the tablet’s Quad Core processor (1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon) and 1 GB RAM plus 8 GB ROM with 32 GB expandable memory gives pretty good performance for work & play and will keep the young users plugged in for a long duration. However, let me specify that Android tablets require good apps to take advantage of everything they have to offer and there are some great ones in the Google Play store.
The QPAD R704 is supported by a 3,500 mAh battery which delivers up to 300 hours of standby time and 10 hours talk time. The Qualcomm Quick Charge technology further allows 30% faster charging on the device. The tablet sports a 2 MP rear camera and 0.3 MP front camera for video calling. In terms of connectivity, the tablet supports Wi-Fi, 3G connectivity, Bluetooth, EDGE and 2G.
My takeaways: The QPAD R704 looks sharp and feels good in the hand. It’s fast enough for everyday tasks, and it has great battery life—all for a reasonable price. Lava seems to have finally cracked the code for balancing price, performance, design, and usability with the R704.
SPECIFICATIONS
Display: 7 inch IPS display with 600 x 1024 pixels

India toughs it out in WTO food-stockpiling rowSpiceJet barred from advance bookings beyond one month
Critics say the food stockpiling amounts to paying farmers to produce food, which is likely to lead to food surpluses that will get dumped on world markets. Photo: AFP
New Delhi/Geneva: India defied the world on Wednesday in a row over food stockpiling that has crippled attempts to reach an global trade agreement, raising doubts that backroom talks can reach a compromise before a Group of 20 summit this month.
At the end of July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pulled the plug on implementing a so-called trade-facilitation deal struck in Bali last year, linking it to the emotive issue of rural poverty in his country of 1.25 billion people.
India wants to keep a so-called ‘peace clause’ that protects its huge state food purchases until the World Trade Organization (WTO) can strike a definitive deal on stockpiling. As originally envisaged in Bali, the clause would expire in four years.
Critics say the food stockpiling amounts to paying farmers to produce food, which is likely to lead to food surpluses that will get dumped on world markets.
New Delhi’s blockade has plunged the WTO into its worst crisis in two decades, leading director general Roberto Azevedo to float the idea of abandoning the consensus principle on which the 160-member group operates.
Modi’s tough line jars with the ‘Make in India’ pitch he has taken to investors abroad in his first five months in charge. Having failed to make progress on trade when he met US President Barack Obama in Washington, he could find himself isolated at his first G20 summit of world leaders in Brisbane, Australia, on 15-16 November.
“India’s position on trade facilitation has been completely misunderstood because of unreasonable positioning by some of the developed countries,” finance minister Arun Jaitley told a World Economic Forum conference in New Delhi.
Jaitley repudiated suggestions that India was fundamentally opposed to trade facilitation, which would entail easing port and customs procedures and, by some estimates, add $1 trillion and 21 million jobs to the global economy.
Quiet diplomacy
India has begun backroom efforts to break the deadlock, sending a top trade ministry official to Geneva this week for talks with Azevedo and key WTO members.
Trade diplomats said that there was no hint, however, that a compromise could be reached on India’s demands, which have been vague and varied in the months since its veto.
On Monday, Modi held a meeting of Indian trade ministry officials to discuss how the deadlock could be broken without compromising India’s food-security concerns.
“If India has to submit a proposal, it would be presented at the right time,” a senior trade ministry official with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
India refuses to bow to foreign calls to scale back a scheme to buy wheat and rice that it distributes to 850 million people. In a recent disclosure to the WTO, India said those purchases cost $13.8 billion in 2010-11 - part of the $56.1 billion it spent in total on farm support.
“All that we are requesting is the settlement of the dispute with regard to the food stock holdings, and the peace clause must continue to co-exist,” Jaitley said.
Diplomats say that without a WTO deal on trade facilitation, countries could simply tack the draft agreement onto their existing membership terms, putting the onus on India to object - and explain why its interests had been damaged by such a move.
Yet economists say WTO members lack any effective means to bring pressure to bear against Asia’s third-largest economy, which is home to a sixth of the world population.
“It’s an issue that in India is so politicised — you have hordes of the population living in poverty and depending on food aid,” said Shilan Shah , an economist who covers India at Capital Economics in London.
“The WTO hasn’t really shown the kind of will to move on without India’s agreement. What it demonstrates is how important India is to the global trading community.” Reuters

Demand for gold snowballed in the wake of the financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, as investors sought the metal as a portfolio diversifier and safe store of value.
It peaked in 2011 at 4,702 tonnes, but had fallen to 4,080 tonnes by last year. Prices XAU=, which crashed 28 per cent last year, have fallen another 3.3 per cent in 2014. This year the WGC expects gold demand to stabilise.
"We expect gold demand to be largely similar to last year, at between 4,000-4,100 tonnes," said Hewitt.
The third quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of outflows from exchange-traded funds. Holdings of the vehicles, which issue securities backed by physical gold, fell 41.3 tonnes last quarter, the data showed.
Global demand for gold jewellery, the biggest single area of consumption, fell 4 per cent to 534 tonnes.
Among supply sources, mine production rose 1 per cent to 812 tonnes, while scrap supply fell 25 per cent to 250.5 tonnes. Year to date, 2014 has seen the lowest level of recycling since 2007, the WGC said.

The company earned US $2.36 on turning every barrel of crude oil into product as opposed to a gross refining margin of US $4.38 per barrel in the year-ago period.

BSE Sensex retreats from record highs; oil cos hit by tax hikeONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
Snapping its three-day rally, the benchmark BSE Sensex today retreated from record highs to end over 68 points lower at 27,940.64 as the shares of state-owned oil companies fell as much as 6 per cent after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel.
The 30-share Sensex commenced on a strong note and soared to the day’s high of 28,098.74 on positive inflation and factory output data announced yesterday.
However, it succumbed to profit-booking and dipped below the 28,000-mark to hit the day’s low of 27,822.70 before recovering partially to settle at 27,940.64, down by 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent.
Yesterday, the benchmark index had ended at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90 and also hit intra-day high of 28,126.48 on sustained foreign funds inflows driven by economic reforms undertaken by the government recently.
The 50-scrip NSE Nifty ended 25.45 points, or 0.30 per cent, down at 8,357.85 after shuttling between 8,408.00 and 8,320.35.
The gauge yesterday concluded at record 8,383.30 after scaling a lifetime (intra-day) high of 8,415.05.
Meanwhile, country’s industrial production grew at 2.5 per cent in September and retail inflation eased to 5.52 per cent in October from 6.46 per cent in September, according to data released after market hours yesterday.
Besides profit-booking in blue-chip stocks, sentiments also dampened after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs 13,000 crore in revenue.
Stocks of state-run companies such as BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil Corp came under selling pressure and ended up to 6.11 per cent lower.
ONGC was among the biggest Sensex losers, plunging by 2.03 per cent, while RIL fell by 0.53 per cent.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 459.47 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Brokers said the market was in an over-bought position and participants adopted a cautious stance and preferred to lighten some positions by booking profits at record levels.
Selling was more pronounced in realty, PSU, metal, infrastructure, banking, power and auto stocks, which dragged down the key indices – Sensex and Nifty – from record highs.
Sesa Sterlite down by 2.50 per cent, Tata Power shed 2.47 per cent, GAIL fell 1.58 per cent, Axis Bank down 1.49 per cent, Hero MotoCorp by 1.38 per cent and HDFC by 1.14 per cent.
Bucking the trend, Infosys surged 1.77 per cent, Dr Reddy by 1.01 per cent, Cipla 0.91 per cent, Wipro 0.69 per cent, Bharti airtel 0.68 and Bajaj Auto 0.54 per cent and averted any major fall in the Sensex.
Among Sensex components, 16 stocks ended in negative territory, while 14 closed higher.
Sectorwise, BSE Oil & Gas index suffered the most by falling 1.63 per cent, followed by Realty index (1.44 pc), PSU index (1.32 pc), Infrastructure index (0.78 pc) Metal index (0.76 pc), Banking index (0.71 per cent), Power index (0.44 pc) and Auto index (0.39 pc).
Towards the global markets, trend on the other Asian markets remained firm and European markets opened higher, rebounding from yesterday’s biggest drop in four weeks.

Vijay Mallya s United Breweries Q2 net profit at Rs 42.62 croreInfosys founders, including Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
Vijay Mallya’s liquor firm United Breweries today reported a net profit of Rs 42.62 crore for the second quarter ended September.
The company had posted a net loss of Rs 18.57 crore during the same period of previous fiscal.
Net sales of the company stood at Rs 959.86 crore during the second quarter, up 27.60 per cent as against Rs 752.2 crore in the same period of previous fiscal, United Breweries Ltd said in a filing to the BSE.
“The just concluded quarter saw the company achieving better gross profit margins on account of selective price increase in some markets and lower input costs primarily due to usage of a higher percentage of recycled bottles,” the company said in a statement.
“Double digit industry growth was widespread across regions, growth spurred primarily on account of strong beer. Mild beer too witnessed promising growth,” it added.
United Breweries said its plan for setting up a greenfield brewery in Bihar is on track and it is likely to commence operations during the last quarter of this fiscal.
Shares of United Breweries were trading 2.67 per cent up at Rs 704.95 during afternoon session on the BSE.

Pharma firms may flood market with luxury condoms if price cap removed: Centre to HCInfosys founders, including Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
The Centre today told the Delhi High Court that if luxury condoms are removed from the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO) then the manufacturers will flood the market with their expensive variety and make their lesser priced contraceptives scarce.
The submission was made before a bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain who said “if we exclude high priced condoms from DPCO, they (manufacturers) may flood market with their high-priced varieties”.
“They may even make their lower priced brands/products scarce or in poor packaging which may not inspire confidence in the consumers,” the ASG said adding that it could lead to creation of a class within a class.
The court said in response that the government can impose conditions on the companies to maintain the same proportion of manufacture as of now.
The court was hearing a plea by pharma firms Reckitt Benckiser and J K Ansell Ltd (JKAL) which have challenged the government’s decision to put a ceiling on the prices of condoms by including the product in the DPCO.
On the last date of hearing, the court had queried what was the issue if consumers are willing to pay for premium or luxury male contraceptives.
The government had earlier said condoms are currently in the national list of essential medicines and there can be no gradation, of luxury and ordinary, where drugs are concerned.
The pharma firms have in their pleas contended that their products are ‘devices’ and not ‘medicines’ and thus would not fall under the DPCO and therefore, no cap can be put on the prices.
The firms have claimed their products are luxury products “meant for pleasure” and have also sought clarification on whether the current ceiling would apply to only utility condoms and whether NPPA proposes to fix a separate cap on “pleasure condoms”.
The Centre had in July told the court that it has increased the cap on prices of all brands of condoms in the country by 22 per cent. However, the increase in prices comes to Rs 1.48.
The companies in their pleas have challenged a November 5, 2013 notification of the government according to which the ceiling on condom prices was fixed at Rs 6.56.
In its petition, Reckitt Benckiser has argued that the low ceiling price will force bigger companies to stop production, which in turn will have a negative effect on population control measures.
The central government, however, is of the view that since condoms help to prevent diseases, they came under the classification of ‘medicines’ and, hence, their prices can be controlled.

Indian economy: Inflation continues trending downFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Inflation continues trending down. The sharp deceleration in retail inflation has been a combination of favorable base effect and easing sequential momentum. Meanwhile, weak demand side of the economy, reinforced by sluggish growth indicators, has kept core inflation subdued. Room for any monetary policy easing will likely open up only in early-FY2016 if disinflationary process continues beyond the transient base-effects—the first signs of which will likely emerge in December print. Read Full Report: Kotak Economy
Inflation continues to soften…
The headline CPI inflation decelerated further in October, printing 5.5% after 6.5% in September. This was the lowest since inception of the series. More important, the sequential quarterly momentum has also eased for the fourth successive month and is currently tracking ~4.3% (3M/3M SAAR). Expectedly, the major contribution came from food component, which fell sharply to 5.6%, helped by sequential contraction of 2.6% in vegetable prices from 1.9% correction in September. Most of the other sub-categories in food (protein goods and cereals) saw sequential pick-up. November is likely to see another round of sharp correction on headline inflation (partly helped by favorable base effect), before rebounding to ~7.0% in 4QFY15.
…with steady core inflation
Core CPI (ex food and fuel) inflation was largely unchanged at 5.9% in October. The miscellaneous items inflation (comprising education, medical care and household requisites) printed 4.7%, while housing inflation was a steady 8.0%. However, sequential momentum in core inflation continues to be subdued hinting at (1) muted demand side pressure and thus low pricing power of producers and (2) trickle down of reduction in producers’ input prices owing to falling global commodities. Core inflation is likely to ease further in the coming months helped by favorable base effect of last year. We expect core inflation to average ~6.5% in FY2015 compared to 8.1% in FY2014.
September IIP picks up on pre-festive demand
IIP growth expectedly picked up in September to 2.5% from 0.5% in August owing to pre-festive production boost. The core sector growth and auto sector production data for the month also hinted at some rebound in industrial production. However, this recovery will be transient as in October this trend is likely to revert to trend. Sector-wise, capital goods rebounded sharply to 11.6% from (-)9.8% in September, while consumer durables production contracted 11.3% and non-durables production grew 1.5%.
Scope for policy easing only in FY2016
The better-than-expected CPI inflation print will likely increase the market expectations for rate cuts. We note that retail inflation has indeed eased more than what the base effect would have suggested as the sequential momentum has also abated over the recent months. With the January-March 2015 inflation readings now seen in sub-7% levels (120-130 bps lower than the RBI’s target of 8%), there appears some room for monetary accommodation if the disinflationary process continues. While we rule out any immediate reaction from the RBI, the RBI can have some opportunity in early-FY2016 (after FY2016 Union Budget). However, this scope can be realistically evaluated only after the base effects dissipate after November.

HTC Desire 816 G review: An option if you wants a large screen phone with good cameraInfosys founders, including Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC first launched its Desire 816 phablet in June at a price of Rs 24,450 in India. After three months, in September, it introduced the cheaper version in the form of Desire 816 G at a price of Rs 18,990. The only major difference is that the former houses a 1.6 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor while the Desire 816 G has a 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek processor. There are not many phablets featuring a 5.5-inch screen in the sub Rs 20,000 range, so, is the Desire 816 G a good buy? We check out.
Quick specs: 5.5-inch 1280 x 720 HD display | 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek processor | Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS | 1 GB RAM | 8 GB internal memory expandable up to 32 GB | 13MP rear camera with auto-focus | 5 MP front camera | Dual Nano SIM (GSM + GSM) | 2600 mAh battery
Price: Rs 18,990
Design: It looks exactly similar to older Desire 816. The front of the phone houses two speakers vents and the 5 MP front camera. There are no capacitive buttons. The back is made out of glossy plastic and cannot be removed. The top right of the phone includes two nano SIM card slots along with a microSD card slot, covered by a plastic flap. The power/wake and volume buttons are on the left, which is frustrating sometimes specially while clicking pictures.
Despite the large 5.5-inch screen, the phone doesn’t compromise on one-handed operability or grip.The review unit was all-white, so, I easily managed to make it look dirty. The phone appears sleek and stylish but the glossy plastic back, makes it slippery.
The phone feels solid but the build quality is not strong. It’s a delicate smartphone which needs to be handled with care.
Display: The 1280 x 720 HD display is decent. HTC is not offering something unique in the display of this phablet. However, there is no Corning Gorilla glass or similar protection, which is very surprising! The display is good for watching movies, playing games and average users shouldn’t have any complains. The viewing angles are good and offer decent outdoor visibility as well.
Performance: In the age of octa-core processors, HTC is not offering anything tempting at least on paper. However, the quad-core MediaTek processor performs well. I did not witness any lags and again average users shouldn’t have any complains related to the performance. Overall, the experience is smooth.
Camera: The smartphone comes with a good camera. The images captured in low light also come with fair amount of detailing. Daylight images are even better with accurate colours. The 5 MP front camera also captures good quality selfies provided if you can hold a 5.5-inch phone with one hand. Overall, users will love the camera of this smartphone.
Connectivity: There are no issues with connectivity.
Battery: The 2600 mAh battery does a decent job. It can easily last an entire day for an average user.
Storage: The device offers 8GB of internal storage out of which around 4 GB is available. The memory can be further expanded up to 32 GB. So, investing in more storage is recommended.
Verdict: HTC has done a decent job by placing a 5.5-inch phone in Rs 18,000 segment. If you want to buy a large screen phone with a good camera then you can consider the HTC Desire 816 G. The Asus Zenfone 6 is another option at a price of Rs 16,999.
But if you are happy with a 5-inch display, then buying this phone makes little sense as you might find it difficult to fit (any) 5.5-inch screen phone inside your jeans pocket, especially while riding a bike. Also, there are several other 5-inch smartphones at a lower price.

Mutual funds invest Rs 32 000 crore in debt in Oct  total crosses Rs 5 27 435croreONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
Mutual funds pumped in close to a whopping Rs 32,000 crore in the bond market in October, taking the total investment to more than Rs 5 lakh crore since the beginning of the year.
In comparison, foreign investors made a net inflow of a staggering 1.4 lakh crore in the debt market so far in 2014.
As per the latest data compiled by market regulator Sebi, the net investment by mutual funds (MFs) in the debt market during October stood at Rs 31,917 crore.
This takes the total net investment by MFs into the bond market to Rs 5,27,435 crore so far this year. In 2013, mutual funds had invested a net of Rs 5.12 lakh crore in the bond market.
Industry experts attributed the inflows in debt to the new government’s reforms agenda, improved fundamentals of the Indian economy and high interest rates.
Mutual funds are investment vehicles made up of a pool of funds collected from a large number of investors. MFs invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
Moreover, MFs picked up shares to the tune of over Rs 5,900 crore in the equity market last month, making it the fifth consecutive monthly inflow.
MFs have turned net buyers of equities since May 2014. Prior to that, fund houses have been net sellers in the equity market since September last year, while they were net buyers of shares to the tune of Rs 1,607 crore in August 2013.
The latest inflows takes the total net investment by MFs in stocks to Rs 14,000 crore so far this year.

Gold  silver weaken on sluggish demand  globalcuesGold futures price falls on global cues
Gold prices fell by Rs 90 to Rs 26,360 per 10 grams in the national capital today as demand eased at existing levels amid a weak global trend.
Silver too showed weakness and prices declined by Rs 100 to Rs 35,400 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said apart from fall in demand from jewellers and retailers at prevailing levels, a weak global trend as the strengthening dollar eroded appeal for the precious metal, mainly influenced sentiments here.
Gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell by 0.5 per cent to USD 1,156.72 an ounce and silver by 0.2 per cent to USD 15.65 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity declined by Rs 90 each to Rs 26,360 and Rs 26,160 per 10 grams, respectively.
Sovereign, however, remained steady at Rs 23,700 per piece of eight grams.
Similarly, silver ready met with resistance and traded lower by Rs 100 to Rs 35,400 per kg but weekly-based delivery gained Rs 165 to Rs 34,765 per kg on speculative buying.
On the other hand, silver coins continued to be asked at last level of Rs 58,000 for buying and Rs 59,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Wells Fargo said it will sell government-guaranteed student loans worth $8.5 billion to Navient, one of the largest U.S. loan servicing and asset recovery companies.
The bank said the sale would help it focus more on its private student lending business.
Lenders have been facing pressure from regulators to offer more flexible repayment terms on student loans after the government started lending directly to students since mid-2010.
Wells Fargo has not issued federal student loans since June 2010.

India becomes the world s biggest gold consumer - once againPrint
LONDON (Reuters) - Global gold demand fell to its lowest in nearly five years in the third quarter as Chinese buying slid by a third, the World Gold Council said on Thursday, putting it back behind India as the world's biggest gold consumer.
Total gold demand fell 2 percent to 929 tonnes in the third quarter, the data, prepared in conjunction with GFMS analysts at Thomson Reuters, showed. That is the lowest since the last three months of 2009.
Last year's number one consumer China saw a 39 percent drop in jewellery consumption as well as a 30 percent fall in bar and coin investment. Combined demand fell 37 percent.
India once again took over as the world's biggest gold consumer, buying 225.1 tonnes of gold jewellery, coins and bars last quarter, compared to 182.7 tonnes in China.
India, which lost its crown as the leading gold buyer to China in 2011, saw a 60 percent surge in jewellery demand in the third quarter.
"Our forecast for the full year is the same for both India and China. We expect demand in both to come in at between 850-950 tonnes," Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, said. "Both remain very positive pillars of gold demand."
Demand for gold snowballed in the wake of the financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, as investors sought the metal as a portfolio diversifier and safe store of value.
It peaked in 2011 at 4,702 tonnes, but had fallen to 4,080 tonnes by last year. Prices (XAU=), which crashed 28 percent last year, have fallen another 3.3 percent in 2014. This year the WGC expects gold demand to stabilise.
"We expect gold demand to be largely similar to last year, at between 4,000-4,100 tonnes," said Hewitt.
The third quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of outflows from exchange-traded funds. Holdings of the vehicles, which issue securities backed by physical gold, fell 41.3 tonnes last quarter, the data showed.
Global demand for gold jewellery, the biggest single area of consumption, fell 4 percent to 534 tonnes.
Among supply sources, mine production rose 1 percent to 812 tonnes, while scrap supply fell 25 percent to 250.5 tonnes. Year to date, 2014 has seen the lowest level of recycling since 2007, the WGC said.

Making sense of the NCAP brouhahaMaking sense of the NCAP brouhaha
Murali Gopalan

For a country that tops the list of road deaths worldwide, at nearly 150,000 annually, India can't afford to take the issue of safety lightly
It defines itself on its website as ‘a newly established non-profit organisation registered in the UK which aims to encourage the worldwide availability of independent consumer information about the safety of motor vehicles’.
From India’s point of view, however, the Global New Car Assessment Programme is perhaps stretching its mandate a little too far. Last week, it asked Nissan to withdraw the ‘substandard’ Datsun GO compact car from the market after it had failed crash tests.
Scaremongering?
While Nissan was clearly rattled, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers was not amused either. Just a day earlier, its top management had dismissed Global NCAP’s findings on the Maruti-Suzuki Swift and GO as futile efforts in ‘scaremongering’. SIAM also made it amply clear that India had its own safety regulations in place and there was no reason for Global NCAP to play the proverbial gatecrasher with its own set of rules.
“It is an NGO which is desperate to get a foothold into India as it has in other countries, including China. This is its way of getting even for being denied an entry here,” a top auto industry official says. According to him, there was also no reason for Global NCAP to carry out frontal crash tests of these cars at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour which are even higher than the European Union’s mandated 56 kmph.
There are also serious questions being raised about singling out the Datsun GO for withdrawal from the Indian market. Apart from Suzuki’s Swift, other models like the Alto, Tata Nano, Figo and Hyundai i10 had failed Global NCAP’s crash tests earlier.
“Is there a witch hunt going on against Nissan especially when GO’s numbers are little to write home about anyway? And will these findings impact Datsun sales across other emerging markets like Russia and Indonesia?” an industry observer wonders. After all, Nissan is betting on brand Datsun to be the critical growth lever this decade and any adverse comment can affect customer sentiment which is already happening with the GO in India.
Safety issues
Has Global NCAP, therefore, got it completely wrong about safety standards of these cars? That would be a baseless charge since practically no model in India’s entry car segment is equipped to handle a top-speed frontal crash impact. Should all of them, therefore, be scrapped since they are not equipped with safety devices like airbags? Not unless our laws mandate them. “Till that happens, there is really no case for Global NCAP to get all apoplectic about issues where India should frame appropriate solutions in line with market realities,” an auto industry CEO says. This is where an important initiative like the long overdue NATRiP (National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project) will help the cause. The plan involved setting up world-class testing facilities across seven centres in the north, west and south and it looks like the plan will finally kick off next year.
There are a host of issues that still need to be considered very carefully. For one thing, a large number of road deaths occur outside a car which only reinforces the need for people to drive around in one instead. It was recognition of this reality that prompted former Tata group Chairman, Ratan Tata to develop the Nano as a solution.
Cost vs safety
Affordability remains a big challenge in India which also explains why this is the largest market for two-wheelers in the road with over 15 million units produced annually. If some of these people want to graduate to a car, the Alto or Eon are the best bets since they are priced under Rs 3-lakh. How does one then strike the balance between adding safety features, which will add to the costs, and still provide an affordable mobility solution for the masses?
Bajaj Auto’s RE60 quadricycle, for instance, set the cat among the pigeons when companies like Tata Motors and TVS Motor opposed its entry for reasons of safety. Others like Mahindra & Mahindra and Piaggio are apparently working on their own quadricycles though neither has officially confirmed these plans. From Bajaj’s point of view, this vehicle is a safer option for three-wheeler commuters and will, in no way, draw entry car buyers to its fold. Its rivals do not share this view and this debate will go on even while the RE60 is scheduled to debut in the coming months.
By the end of the day, India will just have to ensure that safety measures are enforced, right from seatbelts to helmets for two-wheeler riders. Trucks, likewise, seldom have tail lamps which only increases the risk of collisions. It is in this chaotic ecosystem that Global NCAP is seeking change in a hurry. Nobody is suggesting that Indian lives are cheap: most of us, it would seem, do not value them too highly in the first place and this is where the problem arises.

Porsche to add two new models to the Cayenne line-upPorsche to add two new models to the Cayenne line-up

New GTS and base model add variety and depth to the portfolio
In the luxury sports utility vehicle market, Porsche has met with great success worldwide, especially in key markets such as the US and China. In fact, it is quite the case of the tables being turned with the success of the German luxury car brand’s four-door vehicles (SUVs and the Panamera) being widely considered the reason for the current profitability of what was originally an exclusive two-door sports car maker. 
First with the Cayenne and then more recently with the Macan, Porsche has established itself as being the top luxury performance SUV manufacturer - a segment that didn’t seem to exist just a decade ago. Today, Porsche’s competitors in the luxury space are all playing catch up with brands like Bentley and Maserati planning their own SUVs.
For Porsche, the smaller Macan, while expanding reach, has also led to the inevitable fallout where buyers have potentially chosen it over the Cayenne. Possibly to address this issue and to make the Cayenne portfolio more complete, Porsche is launching two new model variants. The new Cayenne GTS and at the lower end of the range, the new entry-level 3.6-litre, V6 petrol engine Cayenne join the brand's stables 
The Cayenne and Cayenne GTS will be celebrating their world premiere next week at the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show. Both models can be ordered as of now.
Cayenne GTS
There is a lot of significance to the new tag. Through its name alone, the new Cayenne GTS announces its outstanding sporting characteristics. With the letters GTS going back to the famous 904 Carrera GTS of 1963; in 2007, the Cayenne GTS became the first Porsche of the modern era to revive the acronym. Since then, the GTS title has signified the brand’s especially sporty models.
Porsche drivers like their cars to be sporty and the company says that the new variants won’t disappoint. A 3.6-litre V6 bi-turbo engine is the performance-oriented enhancement of the new power unit presented in the Cayenne S earlier. Only now, its fuel consumption is said to be lower and it delivers improved levels of performance. Compared to the previous model, which had a V8 naturally aspirated engine, power output of this V6 has increased by 20 hp to 440 hp and torque is up by 85 Nm to 600 Nm.
An official company release mentions that fuel consumption has, however, gone down by up to 0.9 litres per 100 km. The Cayenne GTS also accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 5.2 seconds, or 5.1 seconds with the optional Sport Chrono package.
That’s 0.5 and 0.6 seconds respectively shaved off from the previous model’s best. Top speed of the new Cayenne GTS is 262 kmph. As standard it has a sports exhaust system, which provides the undeniable GTS sound, the release said.
Better performance
In the Cayenne GTS, the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) damping system is said to have a sporty set-up; alongside standard air suspension the vehicle sits 20 millimetres lower for sportier performance. Additional standard features include the brakes from the Cayenne Turbo with 390-millimetre discs on the front axle (358 millimetres at the back), inclusive of brake callipers painted red in typical turbo fashion. Design attributes externally also showcase the sportiness of Porsche’s new Cayenne GTS. As standard, it has the turbo nose section with large air intakes and the Sport The new design package including; more contoured side sills, wheel arch extensions, roof spoiler and lower rear of the vehicle, all painted in the car body colour. All around the car, the colour black provides some striking contrasts. The striking GTS lettering is also a new external feature that can be found on the front doors.
The sporting characteristics are also apparent in the cars’ interior. Eight-way electrically adjustable GTS sports seats in leather/Alcantara upholstery, with GTS lettering on the headrests are fitted as standard. The interior GTS package is optionally available in carmine red or rhodium silver with rev counter face, decorative stitching, headrest lettering and safety belts in contrasting colour.
Base model
The new Cayenne base model features the 3.6-litre V6 naturally aspirated engine, which delivers 300 hp, taking the car from 0 to 100 kmph in 7.7 seconds. This results in a marginal improvement from the previous and the 230-kmph top speed matches the previous model. But, like all new Cayenne models, it benefits from the general efficiency measures, such as coasting, Auto Stop/Start function and thermal management, as a result of which fuel consumption drops by 0.7 litres per 100 km to 9.2 litres per 100 km. CO2 emissions of 215 gm per km is also 21 gm lower than before.
Compared to the previous model the new Cayenne also offers more comprehensive standard features, including a new eight-speed Tiptronic S transmission, bi-xenon main headlights with four-point LED daytime driving lights, the multi-function sports steering wheel with paddle switches and the automatic boot lid.

Increase in sale of two-wheelers by 10 per cent shows changing buyer preference
Carmakers would have been despondent when SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) put out its October sales early this week.
Sales had fallen by 2.55 per cent to 1.59 lakh units while this was steeper in utility vehicles which plummeted 15 per cent to 48,465 units.
Numbers game
Two-wheeler sales were down too with October sales totalling 1.46 million units, a fall of 3.61 per cent from 1.51 million units in the same month last year.
However, scooters bucked the trend with numbers up by 10.89 per cent to 3.84 (3.46) lakh units, a clear indication of changing buyer preference.
This was even more apparent in cumulative sales (April-October) this fiscal where scooters have jumped 28.45 per cent to 2.57 million units from a little over two million units last fiscal.
Bike sales have seen a comparatively modest increase of 7.97 per cent (albeit on a larger base) from 6.12 million to 6.6 million units.
However, their exports have seen a significant leap of 21.56 per cent to 1.36 million units from 1.12 million units in the period of April-October last year.
Main players
It is clear that in the domestic market, scooters are drawing more buyers with Honda’s Activa leading the fray with monthly sales of over two lakh units. TVS Motor and Hero MotoCorp are its two main rivals even though their combined sales are still lower than the Japanese automaker.
Honda will enhance its scooter production by at least one lakh units a month when its Gujarat plant goes on stream in early 2016.
By this time, scooters will take up over 35 per cent of total two-wheelers sold in India and this proportion will only increase during the course of this decade.
Looking ahead
This fiscal will see two-wheeler production touch 17 million units and industry experts believe numbers will be up at least ten per cent annually. By 2020, India will be rolling out nearly 30 million bikes and scooters every year. It remains to be seen how the customer mix will pan out though it would be logical to assume that the share of scooters would be nearly 50 per cent by then.

Is Thailand spreading itself too thin in Eco Car driveIs Thailand spreading itself too thin in Eco Car drive?
AMMAR MASTER
Tweet
With an investment of about $2 billion, an output of 600,000 cars by 2020 are expected
After its good run in the production of one-tonne pickup trucks, Thailand is now focused on becoming a major hub for economical, eco-friendly cars through its two phases of the Eco Car project. The million dollar question, however, is: where are the buyers?
Green ambition
Mind you, the six vehicle makers who have received approval from Thailand’s Board of Investment for Eco Car phase 2 are confident of manufacturing 100,000 vehicles apiece by the fourth year of production. In total, the approved projects amount to planned investments of close to $2 billion.
The ones which have got the green signal are Chevrolet, Ford, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Toyota while approval is still awaited for Honda, SAIC-MG, Suzuki and Volkswagen.
With build of these vehicles likely to start in circa 2015-16, we are looking at an output of 600,000 Eco Cars by circa 2020, not counting the production of the original five participants of Eco Car 1. The list included Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Toyota.
It is, however, still unclear whether output under both phases of Eco Car can be combined to meet the 100,000-units production criteria. After all, the Government’s biggest concern is not the production quota, but the new investments the automakers are bringing into the country. This is particularly significant with neighbouring Indonesia starting to gain prominence and attracting more investments in the last couple of years.
It is also important to note here that Thailand announced its Eco Car Phase 2 project not long after Indonesia finalised its own Low-Cost Green Car (LCGC) programme, which in itself was an inspired version of Thai Eco Car 1. Thailand’s announcement, therefore, served as a stopgap measure for investments swiftly pouring into Indonesia, forcing OEMs to reconsider and weigh the kingdom’s benefits against those of the island nation.
The ploy was successful as OEMs considered Thailand’s better infrastructure and an advanced supplier network as advantages. More importantly, the fact is in spite of the changing political landscape, Thailand’s investment policies have been fairly untouched. Subsequent governments have realised this is a winning formula and changing it would be bad for business.
Demand matters
As we consider Thailand’s increased Eco Car output over the next five to six years, it is difficult to put a finger on the markets for these vehicles. Certainly, there is not enough local demand to meet the higher production.
Hence, exports would remain a critical part of the equation. Again, the bigger small car markets such as India or Brazil are serviced by domestic production. Europe can be a potentially larger export market, but even so more output to meet demand is going to Eastern Europe. North America is also emerging as a significant market but cannot absorb all of the output on its own.
This is why we believe the participants would have to sacrifice production at an existing line in favour of Thailand to meet the output criteria.
A global balance is required, as new demand of up to 600,000 units over the next five years is unlikely to be generated in lieu of the global economic and political risks. For now, it is anybody’s guess how the global strategy will play out.

Beating inflation is a tightrope walkBeating inflation is a tightrope walk
SS TARAPORE
This is not the time for RBI to relent on interest rates. That may ratchet up inflationary expectations all over again
November 13, 2014:  
The recent abatement of the year-on-year Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate to below 7 per cent has generated a chorus of pleas from India Inc for a reduction in Reserve Bank of India (RBI) policy interest rates. Adding grist to the mills is Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s clarion call for a reduction in interest rates.
This is most unfortunate. So far, the NDA government’s stance had been that interest rate policy was the prerogative of the RBI.
The inflation battle
The history of India’s battle against inflation is replete with instances of taking the foot off the brakes just as the RBI is about to slay the ‘inflation monster’, thus giving it a breather to claw at the entrails of the economy.
When inflation touches double digits, the RBI is severely criticised for having let the genie out of the bottle and there is all round support for inflation control.
But as inflation falls below 7-8 per cent there is a clamour for a reduction in interest rates. It is not appreciated that a premature drop in policy interest rates does not provide an appropriate stimulus to kick-start the economy.
Interest cost is, generally, about 10 per cent of total cost and a one percentage point reduction in interest rates brings down overall costs of production by 0.1 per cent.
By lowering policy interest rates prematurely, all that happens is that banks cut deposit rates and savers are encouraged to shift from financial savings to physical savings.
The banking system has ample liquidity and credit expansion is unduly low (less than 2 per cent on a year-on-year basis) essentially because real sector activity is low.
A cut in interest rates, far from providing a kick-start to the economy, merely gives the inflation rate a kick up.
The new normal
If the RBI prematurely gives up the battle against inflation while it is in the 6 per cent range, the economy gets conditioned that inflation in the region of 6 per cent is the new normal and this is precisely how inflation at each successive surge becomes higher and higher.
Some years ago the RBI would consider that an inflation rate of 6-7 per cent was too high and the tolerance level was considered as 4 per cent.
If the RBI now gives up the battle against inflation at the current level, the next round of inflation will reach stratospheric levels.
It is not for nothing that in the early 1980s, when former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was governor of the RBI, he had said that the governorship of the RBI was the loneliest job in India.
Hence the RBI has to steel itself to relentlessly fight the battle against inflation and not give up prematurely.
If it signals that it has started backing off from its anti-inflationary stance at a higher threshold, inflationary pressures will get entrenched and it will become virtually impossible to eradicate inflation from the system.
It is important that economic agents get the signal that the RBI has an unequivocal, unswerving, anti-inflationary monetary policy.
Opinion-makers have been showing greater maturity than hitherto.
The inflation monster
It is recognised that the recent fall in inflation rate is largely in food and fuel prices which could very easily reverse. Further, there has not been a demand compression.
Moreover, the decline in inflation is due to the base effect which will soon wear off and that could result in a resurgence in inflation. Again, the US Fed will, at some stage in the ensuing months, step up interest rates.
This will result in capital outflows from India. If the RBI reduces policy interest rates now, the increases in RBI would need to be steeper when the Fed increases interest rates.
There is also the possibility of crude oil prices rising, in which case the burden on the Indian fisc could be heavy.
In the event of a widening of gross fiscal deficit, it would not be feasible to ease monetary policy. As such, it would not be appropriate to ease monetary policy.
Even among the EMEs the Indian inflation rate is an outlier. As such the RBI should not risk a reduction in policy interest rates in the ensuing few months.
As the Indian psyche finds a sizeable depreciation of the rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar unacceptable, this would be inconsistent with an easier monetary policy.
For all these reasons a prudent monetary policy would point to the RBI not reducing policy interest rates on December 2, 2014.
I will never tire of repeating ad nauseum the telling statement made by economist PR Brahmananda, a former president of the Indian Economic Association: “Not caring about inflation is like going into battle without caring about the wounded, the dying and the dead.”

Modi should woo the RepublicansModi should woo the Republicans
Rajkamal Rao
Not quite seeing eye to eye The time's right for India - ChromaCo/shutterstock.com
Democrats are in decline. And, ideologically speaking, the BJP and the Republicans have more in common
The Republican wins in the US midterms bring to mind the remarkable victories of the BJP last May. But a closer look shows that the Republican tsunami was even more pronounced than the Modi wave.
In the new US House of Representatives, the party will have a 61-seat majority, the most since World War II.
In the states, the party picked up three additional governors’ mansions for a total of 31 state houses.
So dominant is this position that as a proportion, it is akin to the BJP controlling 19 Indian States (currently the BJP controls seven).
The Republicans may end up with 54 seats in the senate, again well ahead of the Democrats, a feat unheard of in modern elections.
As the Democrats sift through exit polling data, their analysis will likely reveal that the Indian American diaspora roundly abandoned Obama.
It either voted Republican (or did not vote at all) in regions such as northern Virginia, Atlanta, Denver and Charlotte — home to large Indian communities.
This was also true of all the states where the governors’ races flipped — Illinois (Obama’s home state), Maryland and Massachusetts — and where Democrats have ruled for decades.
If this continues, it could have ominous consequences for the Democrats in 2016 when Hillary Clinton is likely to run for President. Indeed, initial reports are pointing to this tectonic shift already.
The National Review confirmed that there was a 21-point shift towards the Republicans from 2012 amongst Asians.
The magazine quoted Karthick Ramakrishnan, a University of California at Riverside political scientist: “Just as the Asian-American vote moved toward the Democratic party over the last two decades, we may be seeing the beginning of a trend where they are moving back closer toward the Republican party.”
Indians have historically been a key part of the Obama alliance although philosophically one would think that they would be more aligned with the GOP platform.
As the most successful ethnic group in the country, Indians are more religious, hold on to conservative ideals, believe in lower taxes, pursue expanded professional opportunities, support increases in legal immigration, and are much less dependent on government benefits.
Immigration reform is doomed
An immediate casualty of the elections is the immigration Bill which passed the US senate in 2013.
It has not been brought up in the House until now. If no action is taken on the Bill before December 31, it quietly dies — and comprehensive immigration reform, in its current avatar, is doomed.
There would be winners and losers amongst Indians here, if that happens. Indian students would lose because one proposal would have exempted advanced degree-holders in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) from current employment-based green card caps.
For the IT majors, the senate Bill was always a mixed bag. On the one side it would have helped by increasing the H-1B limit from 65,000 to 1,15,000, and establishing a market-based H-1B escalator, so that the cap could adjust up to 3,00,000 new H-1B visas.
But it would also have severely limited third-party site placement practices — an idea that is anathema to Indian IT majors. This is why many Indian IT majors quietly lobbied against the senate Bill.
This doesn’t mean all action on immigration is dead. Obama vowed in his post-election news conference that he would act unilaterally in the next few weeks to announce executive action.
Any such step would be technically temporary until a Congress-passed Bill becomes law at which time the new provisions would supersede the executive order.
But this could take a year or two — and benefits once doled out by executive action would be hard to withdraw. It is no surprise that the Republicans have warned Obama to “not poison the well” by going alone on immigration.
Modi should pivot to the GOP
For India, this dramatic turnaround in Washington power presents an opportunity to build on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit. Philosophically again, the BJP has more in common with the Republican agenda — limited government, support for business and investment, emphasis on defence and trade — than the Democrats. The Modi government should begin to aggressively develop relationships with pro-business leaders in the senate, such as 2016 presidential hopeful Rand Paul and the newly elected David Perdue (former CEO of Reebok); and Congressman Paul Ryan and Fred Upton (chairman of the energy and commerce committee) in the House.
We already know how Modi’s outreach to Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is beginning to pay dividends.
One area that Modi could exploit is energy sourcing. The US is brimming with new oil that companies are, by law, forbidden to export. The Republicans would be more likely to ease such restrictions.
Modi would do well to lock up US oil exports at preferential prices in return for not buying oil from Opec rogue states — a move that could bring stability to India’s huge oil import bill while strengthening America’s hand in West Asia.

If gold dips to $1 151-52/oz  buyIf gold dips to $1,151-52/oz, buy
Gnanasekaar T
Stop loss: $1,136; target: $1,185-90
November 13, 2014:  
Comex gold futures were mildly lower on Thursday, as the dollar strengthened and continued outflows from bullion-backed funds showed a weak investor sentiment.
Comex gold futures moved in line with expectations. Though the short-term picture looks supportive for prices, the weekly picture still shows incredible weakness and any up move could prove to be a corrective rebound within a larger downtrend.
Our favoured view expects resistances to cap for near $1,165 an ounce targeting $1,145-50 initially. Prices are seen moving in a narrow range after the sharp fall, either preparing for the next down move or try to attempt testing resistances near $1,190-95 levels or even higher to $1,210. Near-term support is seen at $1,145-50 levels.
Failure to hold support here could further drag prices lower towards $1,125 levels in the coming sessions. Though, the current weakness looks to continue, things can turn cautious below $1,100.
Below $1,100 there are various supports which can lead to a stronger retracement upwards. Favoured view initially expects a rebound higher to $1,185-90 levels and if it fails to follow-through higher could see another round of selling which could take prices lower to above-mentioned targets.
Only a fall below $1,130 could see a sharp fall towards $1,070 levels.
The wave counts have to be revisited again. Fall below $1,250 has forced us to abandon any bullish hopes and look at a bearish one targeting $1,050. The current set of moves from $1,175 to $1,435 is a corrective wave four in an impulse which began from the high of $1,920, with a equality target at $1,020. However, there are many intermediate levels from where good retracement can be seen.
The $1,035-70 could prove to be a good intermediate support. Ideally, from this area, a pullback higher towards $1,300 looks likely.
RSI is in the neutral zone now indicating that it is neither oversold nor overbought. The averages in MACD are below the zero line of the indicator indicating a strong bearish reversal.
Only a cross over again above the zero line could hint at hopes of a bullish revival.
Therefore, look to buy Comex gold initially on dips to $1,151-52 with a stop loss $1,136 targeting $1,185-90.
Supports are at $1,145, 1,130 and 1,110 and resistances are at $1,175, 1,190 and 1,210.

Look East  policy now turned into  Act East  policy: Narendra ModiFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today told world leaders that his government accorded high priority to turn India’s erstwhile “Look East” policy into an “Act East” policy.
“Since entering office six months ago, my government has moved with a great sense of priority and speed to turn our ‘Look East Policy’ into ‘Act East Policy’,” Modi said in his address to the East Asia Summit in the Myanmarese capital Nay Pyi Taw.
“The East Asia Summit is an important pillar of this policy,” he said.
“Look East” was introduced in the early 1990s when the Congress party’s PV Narasimha Rao was prime minister. It was endorsed by former prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh.
Modi said the initiatives taken by the East Asia Summit in disaster preparedness and response are truly commendable.
“No other forum brings together such a large collective weight of global population, youth, economy and military strength. Nor is any other forum so critical for peace, stability and prosperity in Asia-Pacific and the world,” he said.
The one-day summit was attended by a galaxy of world leaders including US President Barack Obama, Russian Premier Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.
Modi was in Myanmar for the India-ASEAN and the East Asia summits on the third day of his 10-day three-nation tour, the next leg of which includes a visit to Australia and Fiji.
ASEAN comprises 10 countries – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Blackmoney: Dabur s Pradip Burman gets bail  barred from leaving IndiaFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Pradip Burman, one of the Dabur India promoters, whose name has figured in the list given by the Centre to the Supreme Court in the blackmoney issue, has been granted bail but barred from leaving the country by a Delhi court in an alleged tax evasion case.
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Devender Kumar Sharma granted the relief to Burman, who appeared before him, but directed that he will not leave the country without its prior permission after the Income Tax (IT) department argued that there was a likelihood that accused may leave the country to avoid his prosecution in the case.
“Having heard the submission on behalf of the parties, the present case being a complaint case, accused Pradip Burman is admitted to bail subject to furnishing of personal bond in a sum of Rs 25,000 and a surety of like amount.
“Further the accused is hereby directed not to leave the country without prior intimation and prior permission from this court during the pending trial,” the court said.
According to IT department’s complaint, Burman was holding foreign bank accounts but he did not disclose about it in his income tax returns and there were undisclosed deposits in those two accounts.
Advocate Brijesh Garg, appearing for IT department, said when Burman was questioned, he denied having any account in foreign bank but later on, when he was confronted with several documents, he admitted having bank accounts abroad.
A case was registered against Burman under the Income Tax Act for the offences relating to concealment of income and tax evasion.
The court, after taking cognisance of the complaint by the IT department, had summoned Burman as accused in the case.
Burman appeared in the court in pursuance to summons issued against him and he was supplied with the copy of the complaint and other documents.
The court has now fixed the matter for December 3 for pre­charge evidence and all the witnesses have been summoned for that day.
Seeking bail, Burman’s counsel submitted that it was a complaint case and his client was ready to abide by any terms and conditions imposed by the court.
IT department’s counsel Garg submitted that the complaint was filed against Burman for evasion of tax and for furnishing false information/verification.
“The present case is out of several cases in respect to black money for which investigation is going on by the and under the supervision of Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the Supreme Court of India,” Garg said.
He said the court should impose condition upon him not to go outside the country as there was every likelihood that he may leave the country to avoid his prosecution.
The Centre on October 27 has disclosed before the apex court eight more names including that of Burman, a bullion trader and Goa miners against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and Goa-based mining company Timblo Private Limited and its five directors were among the names that figured in the list which was filed in the Supreme Court by the government.
While Burman’s name was received from French authorities, the names of Lodhia and others have been received from “other countries”.
Shortly after the disclosure in the Supreme Court, Dabur India promoter family, Burmans had said the account complied with all legal requirements.
“We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” a Dabur spokesperson had said in a statement.

Financial Technologies moves Bombay HC against Govt order on merger withNSELONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
The Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL) has filed a petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the recent government order to merge its crippled National Spot Exchange with itself.
FTIL has questioned the impugned order issued by the Corporate Affairs Ministry on October 21 for proposed “forced” amalgamation of the now shut National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) with the company.
The company will take further steps as per advise of the legal counsel/lawyer, FTIL said in a communique to the BSE today.
The government had last month ordered the merger of the bourse with its parent firm, FTIL, in order to ensure faster recovery of dues for entities hit by the Rs 5600 crore fraud at NSEL.
FTIL owns 99.99 percent of NSEL, on which trading was suspended after the fraud came to light in July 2013.
Earlier, some minority shareholders of FTIL have raised objections to the proposed merger of the scam-hit NSEL with the company.
The payment crisis at NSEL came to light in July 2013 and the decision to merge it with FTIL has been taken as the bourse is not left with any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of dues, according to official sources.
The proposal of merger would take a final shape after taking into account submissions or objections made by the shareholders and creditors of the two companies. Comments have been sought from them till December 20.
NSEL’s entire business, properties and liabilities, among others, would be transferred to FTIL after the merger, according to the order issued on October 21.
The ministry had said that FTIL cannot be allowed to confine its responsibility and concern only for the small investors alone and it has to shoulder full responsibility for the outstanding dues at NSEL.
FTIL has prayed in the petition that the Government order was bad in law and needs to be quashed.

Market Outlook: Stocks set for consolidation in the neartermIn spite of better than expected numbers from CPI inflation and index of industrial production (IIP), market did not cheer but consolidated near all time high.
Now the risk shifts to RBI meet for a possibility to cut interest rate.
As per the statement from RBI, there is little possibility to lower rates as they are likely to wait to understand the trajectory in the near-term.
Added the hike in excise duty for fuels is taken negatively by the market.
Also Q2FY15 numbers are largely in line with estimates and does not provide any possibility to increase earnings growth for FY15E.
These factors could make further market to consolidate in the near term and will now focus on winter session as a key event.

If you provide for neutralising inflation by increasing the Minimum Support Price every year, then the question of distortion will not arise - ANWARUL HODA
If the conditions (governing food subsidies) are not removed, these will hang over India’s head like the proverbial ‘Damocles’ sword’ - BISWAJIT DHAR
‘An indefinite peace clause is an improvement but it is not enough’
New Delhi, November 13:  
The devil may well lie in the details related to the use of the ‘peace clause’ in the WTO food security agreement, which have not been revealed either by India or the US, trade experts say.
The peace clause is the legal provision insulating members against action by other members in case of a breach of farm subsidy levels. New Delhi had agreed to a peace clause at the Bali meet till a permanent solution was found. It was later revealed that the peace clause, which was riddled with conditions such as non-trade distortive food programmes, was valid only till 2017.
Getting the US to agree to an indefinite peace clause seems like an improvement over what was agreed to at the Bali Ministerial, but it may not be enough, said Afsar Jafri from Focus on the Global South, a trade policy think-tank.
“It is important that the conditions for using the peace clause also get dropped as it is not possible for any country to follow these,” Jafri said.
India had demanded last year, in return for its consent to a trade facilitation agreement, that food procurement subsidies be exempted from the category of distorting subsidies. Other suggestions included changing the formula for calculating subsidies by updating the base year for calculation or indexing it to inflation.
“Many countries have been saying that India exports foodgrain from the procurement carried out by Food Corporation of India and this leads to trade distortion. You cannot stop any country from making such allegations,” Jafri said.
There could be a simple way of resolving this problem, according to Anwarul Hoda, former Deputy Director General of the WTO and a professor at research body ICRIER. “If you provide for neutralising inflation by increasing the Minimum Support Price every year, then the question of distortion will not arise,” Hoda said.
Hoda had earlier written a paper with agriculture expert Ashok Gulati explaining how proper interpretation of Article 18.4 of the WTO’s Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), which talks about making adjustments for inflation, could take care of India’s problems.
Damocles’ sword
Biswajit Dhar, Professor, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said that if conditions are not removed, these will hang over India’s head like a ‘Damocles’ sword’.
“You will always be worried if you can implement your food security programmes,” he said.

India has 10 m fewer stunted children under 5: WHORapid strides: The report says India is experiencing much faster improvement in health indicators than currently assumed
Report lauds rapid progress in health indicators, especially in Maharashtra
New Delhi, November 13:  
India is making rapid strides in overcoming the problem of malnutrition, with the number of stunted children under the age of five declining by over 10 million, says a ‘Global Nutrition Report’.
The “first-ever comprehensive narrative on global health and country-level progress toward reducing malnutrition”, brought out by a consortium of nations, organisations, researchers, and academics, covers each of the United Nations’ 192 member states, and will be a “centrepiece” of the Second International Conference on Nutrition in Rome from November 19-21. The conference is being organised by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation.
“The new, provisional, national data suggest India is experiencing a much faster improvement in World Health Assembly (WHA) indicators than currently assumed,” said a statement by the International Food Policy Research Institute.
The WHA targets a 45 per cent reduction in stunted children under five, and 50 per cent reduction in anaemia among women of child-bearing age by 2012, among other objectives.
Impressive Maharashtra
The report cites the case of Maharashtra, where a new State-wide survey (Haddad et al. 2014), shows that it took only seven years to reduce child stunting by one-third, from 36.5 per cent to 24 per cent, for an annual average rate of reduction of 5.8 per cent.
Stunting declines in Maharashtra resulted from a combination of nutrition-specific interventions, improved access to food and education, and reductions in poverty and fertility, says the report.
However, it notes that the world as a whole is currently not on course to meet global nutrition targets set by the WHA, and calls for extending coverage of nutrition-specific programmes, and recruiting more nutrition workers, among other recommendations.
“We need to develop targets or norms for spending on nutrition,” says the report, adding that more needs to be done to hold donors, countries and agencies accountable for meeting their commitments to improve nutrition.
“Malnutrition corrodes the body, the economy and the future. Ambitions for sustainable development are likely to be thwarted by its presence,” it adds.

One irritant out of way  says Indo-American lobby group‘One irritant’ out of way, says Indo-American lobby group
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, November 13:  
Representatives of the Indian-American community see the understanding reached between the respective Governments over food security and public procurement at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as ‘one irritant’ out of the way of stronger trade ties.
Robinder Sachdev, India Affairs chief of the United States-India Political Action Committee (USINPAC), said it is a good signal, though the nuances are yet to be disclosed.
“Prior to this, while taking up bilateral issues, including IPR, technology transfer, and defence between the two countries, the ‘WTO’ component was always there. Now, this aspect, we hope, is removed,” he told BusinessLine.
The new Indian Government had not gone ahead with the commitments made by the previous regime at the WTO’s Bali meet. Asked how far India would have moved to break the impasse, he said both sides would have made compromises. “Remember, each has to answer its domestic constituency. And the impasse at the WTO, though a global issue, was having an impact on bilateral ties.”
India’s proposal on food security will now be placed before the WTO General Council when it meets next month.
USINPAC represents over 3.2 million Indian-Americans and was actively involved in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent US visit. On the role bodies such as USINPAC play in breaking such logjams, Sachdev said: “We don’t play any direct role here. The talks are more Government-to-Government. But, we do bring forth concerns on the trade front and help in making the US Government understand the thoughts of the Indian side.”

Farmers groups still in the darkFarmers’ groups still in the dark
Tomojit Basu
The farmers claim the the Government is not keeping their interests in mind and the issue of food security has become 'consumer-centric'.
The issue has become consumer-centric, complain farmers
New Delhi, November 13:  
Members of farmers’ organisations are unsure of how the India-US agreement on farm subsidy at the WTO would affect them given the paucity of information released.
“I am unable to comment at this juncture as there is no clarity on the matter. We will be meeting with the Agriculture Minister to learn more about this development,” said Naresh Sirohi, General Secretary, Kisan Morcha, the BJP’s farmers’ wing.
While Yudhveer Singh, the General Secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), was unsure of the details, he was sceptical about the Government’s desire to help small farmers.
“Negotiations shouldn’t be carried on in the name of food security but in terms of agricultural subsidies which create a level playing field. Farming in the US and Europe is largely run by companies, almost 80 per cent, which are heavily subsidised by their governments,” he told BusinessLine. “The subsidies in this case were related to consumers and not farmers per se. In Bali, the tone changed from one of getting developed countries to cut subsidies to food security which is a different matter altogether. For instance, they count the subsidies going to the PDS. What does the farmer get from such subsidies? The whole issue has become consumer-centric and the present Government has continued towing the same line,” added Singh.
India had not backed the Trade Facilitation Agreement, fearing that approval would affect its $12-billion food security programme which procures foodgrains at the minimum support price, which is then sold to poor households and the rest is stockpiled.
WTO norms cap the value of food subsidies at 10 per cent of the total value of production but which calculates subsidies on the basis of prices that prevailed in 1986.

FinMin  RBI to meet again to review gold import curbsFinMin, RBI to meet again to review gold import curbs
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, November 13:  
The Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India will continue their deliberations in a day or two on reviewing ‘80:20’ scheme for gold import. This scheme mandates an entity importing gold to re-export 20 per cent of it in value-added form.
Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi chaired a meeting on Thursday to review the scheme in the wake of sharp surge in gold imports, but had to leave for a sudden meeting with the Finance Minister. Thursday’s meeting was attended by Revenue Secretary Shaktikanta Das besides senior officials from the Finance Ministry and RBI.
Gold imports surged nearly 450 per cent in September, while they rose over 175 per cent in August. This is despite 10 per import duty.
The scheme was introduced July last year to curb imports so that the current account deficit (CAD) could be checked.
In May this year, RBI relaxed the scheme by allowing Star Trading Houses and Premier Trading Houses (registered as nominated agency with Directorate General of Foreign Trade) apart from nominated banks/agencies/entities to import gold under the scheme.

Nehrus 125th birth anniversary: Cong mounts attack on ModiPTI Remembering Chacha: Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh at the 125th birth anniversary function of Jawaharlal Nehru at Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi on Thursday.
Roads are being cleaned and photos taken, but poison is being spread, says Rahul
New Delhi, November 13:  
For the first time since its electoral setback in the general elections, the Congress seems to have gathered its political wits.
Starting Thursday, when party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi mounted a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policy initiatives and programmes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Congress has organised a series of events to mark Jawaharlal Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary.
The most crucial congregation, titled the Jawaharlal Nehru Commemorative International Conference, is scheduled for November 17-18. Every key political party except the BJP and its allies has been invited to this.
What’s more, on a personal invitation sent by Sonia herself, politicians across the spectrum including Trinamul Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, CPI(M) leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury, Janata Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, and representatives from the SP, BSP, DMK and AIADMK have agreed to attend the function.
Symbolically, this is the first gathering of socialists of all hues, communists, and splinter groups from the Congress such as TMC, on a Congress platform. Sharad Pawar, whose party NCP has helped the BJP to prove its majority in the Maharashtra Assembly, has expressed his inability to attend the function. The Congress describes it as an alignment of “secular” forces against an ascendant BJP.
Ahead of the function, both Sonia and Rahul launched a direct attack on Modi.
Basic tenets
Speaking at a programme organised by the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee here on Thursday, Sonia accused the BJP Government of deviating from the basic foundations of the country, such as secularism and brotherhood.
“Today, attempts are being made to change the basic tenets of the Nehruvian principles. Those who want to change these principles are attacking the vision and ideology of Nehru. He worked to build a secular, progressive and liberal India,” Sonia said. She urged Congress workers to fight all “such ideologies, institutions and individuals” who want to demolish Nehru’s principles.
Both the leaders admitted that the Congress is facing one of its most difficult periods. They asked the party cadre to put up a united fight against the communal forces.
Rahul said the Congress believes in love and brotherhood. “Today the very foundation of our country built on love and brotherhood is being weakened. This country is our home. On the one hand, the home is being spruced up. Roads are being cleaned. Everybody is getting a photo opportunity and on the other hand poison is being spread. The foundation (of this country) is being weakened,” he said.
He added that only the Congress can fight such tendencies. “Only love can overcome anger and hatred. And the only one organisation which believes in love and brotherhood and is inclusive is the Congress,” the party vice-president said.
“When the foundations get weakened, the nation’s enemies benefit from it. The more united we are, the faster the country will move forward,” he added.

Cong reducing Nehrus stature: BJPCong reducing Nehru’s stature: BJP
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, November 13:  
The BJP on Thursday termed the Congress marking Jawaharlal Nehru’s birth anniversary by collecting all the opposition groups on one platform, an exhibition of partisan politics.
The move only serves to reduce India’s first Prime Minister’s stature from a national icon to a mere party symbol, it said.
BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain charged the Congress with using Nehru’s anniversary to divide society and spread hatred.
He attacked Rahul Gandhi for his remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Swachh Bharat and asserted that Modi “is only trying to accomplish Mahatma Gandhi’s dreams of a Clean India” by connecting people with it to make it a mass movement.
“Congress party is trying to use Nehru’s birth anniversary to play their own politics. Their pledge to unite the society and spread brotherhood is aimed at political gains and actually serves to divide the society. The Congress is playing the politics of hatred and not BJP,” Hussain said.
Calling Nehru a national leader, he accused the Congress of restricting his legacy to the confines of their party and thus reducing his stature.
Hussain further said Modi believes in taking everyone along and ensuring harmony and progress of the nation, and the Congress finds this unpalatable.
“The Congress cannot digest that it is not in power. As they are not used to being out of power, they have now taken to playing the politics of hatred out of frustration and disappointment,” said the BJP spokesperson
The BJP also attacked Rahul for his remarks on Hindi, saying he has no right to insult the language. Rahul had reportedly said, “They (BJP) said do away with English. Had we done this after independence, our youths would not have been able to go to IITs, IIMs…”
Hussain said Rahul has “every right to promote a language but no right to insult a language.”

Masking phone numbers will need security clearanceMasking phone numbers will need security clearance

DoT working on standardised norms for requests to mask outgoing calls
New Delhi, November 13:  
You won’t be able to mask your mobile phone numbers anymore without getting security clearances.
The Department of Telecom is in the process of finalising guidelines which require multiple levels of clearances if anyone requests for masking the phone number while making outgoing calls.
Until now there were no unified guidelines and operators were following their own rules for approving requests for masking phone numbers.
As a result, the facility — technically called Caller Line Identification Restriction (CLIR) — was being indiscriminately given by the telecom operators leading to misuse and concern over possible security breach.
Status symbol
For example, in 2011, some operators were found camouflaging the calling-line identification while making promotional business calls to customers. It was also being used as a status symbol by many.
According to data available with the DoT, there are 1,676 phone numbers on Vodafone’s network in Gujarat where the CLIR facility has been provided.
In Delhi, Airtel has 367 subscribers with masked numbers and Vodafone has 157. The existing provisions under the telecom licence simply states that it shall be the responsibility of the service provider to work out appropriate guidelines to be followed by their staff to prevent misuse of this facility.
While the operators said they have established a standard operating procedure in terms of verifying the requests for CLIR, the security agencies want standardised guidelines to be issued.
According to DoT officials, under the new guidelines, any request for masking phone number from a common user will have to be cleared by the local police and also the Telecom Enforcement Resource and Monitoring (TERM) Cell.
Request made by an officer belonging to any of the central intelligence agencies will have to be recommended by an officer of the rank of Joint Secretary.
Who are exempt
However, persons holding key constitutional posts including Governors, Chief Ministers, Judges of Supreme Court and Services Chiefs have been exempt and can get their phone numbers masked within two days of putting in their request.

JLR warned over possible industrial actionJLR warned over possible industrial action
 Vidya Ram
Unions are unhappy with the company’s final salary pension scheme
London, November 13:  
Jaguar Land Rover was on Thursday warned about possible industrial action after union members in the UK overwhelmingly voted against a pay and conditions offer by the company.  2,881 workers – 96 per cent of union members across the company’s five plants – rejected a three-year pay deal from the company, the Unite union said on Thursday, following the ballot, which took place in the morning.  The union urged JLR to return to the negotiating table “or face an industrial action ballot.”
 JLR on Thursday defended the pay and conditions offer, which it said represented a pay rise worth 7.7 per cent for a typical operator in the first year, and 14.1 per cent over the three-year period.
“Jaguar Land Rover remains committed to reaching a negotiated settlement,” the company said in a statement as it expressed its disappointment with the union’s decision. 
Alex Flynn, a spokesperson for the union said it wasn’t possible to estimate a timeline for the next steps. “Obviously the ball is in the company’s court,” he told Businessline.
 “JLR needs to get back around the negotiating table and hammer out a deal that meets the workforce’s expectations and shares the rewards of the company’s success fairly,” Roger Maddison, Unite’s national officer said in a statement. “Otherwise we will be looking to ballot our members for industrial action across the company’s five sites.”
Voting
 The vote against the offer was expected after unions said shop stewards believed the pay offer fell short of expectations. 
In addition to the size of the proposed wage rise (3.6 per cent plus a bonus in the first year and three per cent in two subsequent years), unions said members fear that un-pensionable bonuses would slowly replace wage rises, which were pensionable.
 Unions are also unhappy with a number of other elements, including changes to the company’s final salary pension scheme. 
Unions say the company is making £240 million of cuts to pensions despite changes to the final salary scheme being negotiated just two years before. In addition, they are critical of the six-year period it would take new starters at JLR to reach 100 per cent pay.
 The standoff pits two perspectives of JLR’s legacy in the UK against each other.
On the one hand JLR has invested billions into the company, creating new plants and jobs – including the new £500-million engine manufacturing centre opened last month which will, when fully running, employ 1,400 people.
On the other unions argue that its workforce has been at the heart of the company’s success, sticking loyally to the company through tough times – including agreeing to a temporary wage freeze at the height of the economic crisis soon after the Tata Group took over the company.

Harvesting a fruit crop a month can help tide over labour costs‘Harvesting a fruit crop a month can help tide over labour costs’
AJ Vinayak
Hawaiian gyaan Ken Love, a Hawaiian fruit grower and Executive Director of Hawaii Tropical Fruit Growers. AJ VINAYAK
Mangalore, November 13:  
Most Indian farmers complain about labour shortage these days. The case is no different in Hawaii.
In a recent chat with BusinessLine, Ken Love, a Hawaiian fruit grower and Executive Director of Hawaii Tropical Fruit Growers, said that he got feedback about labour shortage during his visit to India, and some farmers informed him that they pay $4-6 a day for labour.
In Hawaii, the wage rate is around $15 an hour. “Even at what we have to pay we cannot get help,” he said.
According to him, the diversity of crops can help tackle this problem.
Stating that every month there is another crop or two to harvest for him, he said a half-acre gets picked very quickly.
Giving the example of different varieties of avocados, he said instead of harvesting Sharwil avocados in January, now there are a few trees of Kahaluu avocados to harvest in October, Malama avocados in November, and Linda avocados in March.
There is always something to harvest; something to sell to the wholesaler the grocery store or to some chefs who use fruits as ingredients, he said.
“We are better off when we can sell a little of many different crops at different times instead of a lot of one or two items at one time of year when everyone else has the same crop,” Love said.
In the long run, the grower makes more money with less work and lesser stress. However, he advised that the grower may have to build markets for some of the unusual fruits. “But once you do, you will be far ahead of those who don’t,” he added.

Child under-nutrition is not a poverty issue alone: World BankGood care The report says adequate feeding, healthcare and environmental health are essential.
‘Only 7% infants in wealthy families receive adequate feeding, healthcare’
New Delhi, November 13:  
Under-nutrition among infants in India is not a poverty or food insecurity issue alone, says a new World Bank report, adding that child care, feeding and awareness play an important role even among the wealthy.
According to the report, Nutrition in India, even among the wealthy only about 7 per cent children between 6 and 24 months receive adequate feeding, healthcare and environmental health.
“Appropriate infant and young child feeding practices even in the highest wealth quintile are extremely poor,” said Onno Ruhl, World Bank Country Director in India, in a statement.
The report says three critical things — adequate feeding, healthcare and environmental health — can dramatically reduce stunting in Indian infants, aged 6 to 24 months.
The stunting rate with children who are provided with adequate feeding, care and proper environment is half when compared to children who live without these provisions. Stunting in children not only affects physical growth but is also associated with poor brain and cognitive development.
Stunting
“The prevalence of stunting in children with adequate feeding, care and environmental health is 30 per cent as compared to 54 per cent in those who have none of these in adequate measures,” the statement said.
The report, which analyses data from the National Family Health Survey 2005-06 and the HUMGaMA Survey 2011, says this trend is evident even in States with poor nutrition outcome, such as Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
Focusing on 11 policy briefs covering various aspects of nutrition, the World Bank report says there is only a narrow window of opportunity from conception to two years of age to improve stunting. India loses over $12 billion in GDP to vitamin and mineral deficiencies, the report says, commending the flagship Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme, which made “significant improvement” in the nutritional status of children.
“Coupled with better health, water and sanitation programmes, the ICDS could have a lasting impact on nutrition,” Ashi Kathuria, Senior Nutrition Specialist, World Bank, said.

Editorial: Some respite in sugarGold futures price falls on global cues
If the extraordinarily high cane price in Uttar Pradesh which made most sugar mills lose money wasn’t bad enough, the state’s investment policy is worse. While the Allahabad High Court has ruled in favour of stability, it is an open question as to whether the state will appeal this in the Supreme Court—given this would mean Akhilesh Yadav’s government appealing the policy of his father’s government, it looks unlikely though. In 2004, with not enough sugar mills in the state, as a result of which farmers had to sell their cane at low prices to the relatively inefficient gur/khandsari units, the state—Mulayam Singh was the CM—announced an investment policy offering sops in terms of various levies like purchase tax on sugarcane and trade taxes on molasses. With the caveat that the incentive could never be greater than the investment, the sops were available for 5-10 years. As FE reported on Thursday, around R9,000 crore of investments got made in the state, providing more employment as well as ensuring more cane could be sold to the mills. In 2007, however, when the Mayawati government came to power, it decided to rescind the policy, and began issuing notices to the mills for dues. While the Allahabad High Court has struck this down on grounds of promissory estoppel for Bajaj Hindusthan, it is expected other mills who are in court will get a similar verdict.
Needless to say, any government is free to review decisions taken by its predecessor. This happened at the central level in natural gas prices only recently, and in the case of the 2G licences issued by A Raja in 2008, the Supreme Court cancelled them even though they had been issued by the government. When decisions are reviewed, it is a reasonable expectation that existing concessions be honoured. And in case concessions are to be taken away, or licences cancelled, wrong-doing has to be proved. In this case, however, as the Allahabad High Court has pointed out, no such proof was presented.
While the court ruling provides a much-needed respite for embittered millers, the state’s other policies remain problematic and, sadly, the government lost the last chance it had to fix things. The day of the court verdict, the state announced its State Advised Price (SAP) which, while being frozen for the last two years, is much higher than the Centre’s Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP). As a result of the large losses this entails, sugar mills in the state have been refusing to begin crushing operations this year—they have demanded the state adopt the Rangarajan formula of sharing 75% of receipts with farmers in place of the unacceptably high SAP. With global commodity prices falling to multi-year lows, this is all the more reason for the state to move to this as mills will make larger losses. Also, with the Rangarajan formula in place in states like Maharashtra, sugar from these states can be imported at lower prices into UP. The biggest losers of this policy to help farmers, ironically, will be the farmers since they will end up selling their cane at either the FRP or even lower to gur/khandsari units.

Editorial: Positive momentumFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
With the festive season having set in early this year, factory output for September predictably got a bit of a boost, with dealers presumably indulging in some pre-festive stocking up. An increase in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) of 2.5% yoy would otherwise appear anaemic except that the trend over the past few months has been worse. In August, for instance, the IIP barely moved with the rise at just 0.5% yoy. What was heartening in the September data was the pick-up in the manufacturing sector—an increase of 2.5% yoy versus a contraction of 1.3% yoy in August—in general and the capital goods space in particular. The latter grew 11.6% yoy versus a fall of 9.8% in August. The data has always been volatile, but taken together with better numbers for intermediate goods, suggests an industrial recovery may be taking shape, albeit slowly. Also, IIP would have been higher had it not been for the one-off event of the closure of the Nokia factory in Chennai.
A look at the performance of some key sectors would appear to corroborate this. Domestic sales of commercial vehicles, for instance, seem to be troughing out—total sales in October were down 3% yoy, much better than the drop of 9.14% yoy between April and October. There are, of course, other trends that point to continuing sluggishness in the economy, the most pertinent being the pace of loans disbursed by banks. At close to 11-12%, the momentum in credit growth doesn’t indicate any rush on the part of corporates to add capacities. Also, the key to a definite and secular industrial recovery would have to be a sustained pick-up in the capital goods space; while order books at engineering firms are growing, there aren’t any signs these will swell meaningfully at least for the next 6-8 months. Larsen and Toubro has, in fact, tempered its revenue guidance for the current year.
Though CPI inflation continues to fall—it fell to 5.52% in October from 6.46% in September—few analysts expect RBI to lower repo rates in the policy next month. While FE has maintained inflation’s back is broken—headline inflation was 8.8% in January—and that the crude prices being at a four-year low along with the collapse in global commodity prices will keep inflation low, RBI continues to argue the current collapse is largely driven by the base-effect. But with the so-called base-effect set to be over by next month, analysts are looking at RBI cutting rates by March.

Columns: Could China surpriseRecord cafe: States not prepared for GST, 27% rate can’t work
An emerging consensus is questioning China’s ability to sustain its growth rate even at the scaled-down medium-targets of about 7%. Looking at the international environment and China’s home-grown problems, analysts and China observers are increasingly convinced that past excesses and distortions will catch up sooner than later to pull down growth sharply—way below the new normal accepted by its leaders. Differences range within this overall readings: a protracted, soft-landing versus a ‘crash-landing’; how soon this could happen; and the range of possible policy responses authorities could employ to avert this slowdown in order to adhere to growth targets or to navigate towards a ‘soft’ landing instead. There is general unanimity about a sharp slowdown ‘outcome’ ultimately as also that macro policy measures will not succeed in propping an unsustainable growth pattern beyond the short-term.
Well-founded as this narrative is, is it possible that China defies these views and continues to grow at around 7% ahead? It has after all, on past occasions, overturned entrenched beliefs and displayed a capacity to surprise. Combined with the fact that despite all we know about the Chinese economy, there is only so much we know and much more that we don’t really know, can an inevitable slowdown of the Chinese economy be taken as a certainty?
At 7.3% in the most recent quarter, China’s growth was the slowest since 2009. It was growing at nearly 10% as recently as 2011. GDP growth dropped steeply to 7.7% in the next two years thereafter, while this year’s of 7.5% is looking increasingly hard to achieve to most. Looking at the high costs at which even these scaled-down growth rates are being extracted by Chinese authorities, many are now predicting the country will slow down very sharply to much lower levels—around 5% in the medium-term, or even lower perhaps—as potential growth declines.
Views about China’s future economic performance are predicated upon two broad strands. The first is the apparent difficulty Chinese authorities seem to be having in rebalancing from fixed-investment creation towards higher consumption. Post-crisis, China sought to ward off the export collapse by removing credit controls and injecting easy money that was invested in property and caused a record construction boom.
The property bubble began to deflate at the start of this year: sales and prices have slumped; there is extensive oversupply in the housing market with secondary effects upon steel and related industries, all of which have combined to drag down growth. A host of selective monetary measures, viz reduced reserve requirements for some banks, direct loan injections to big banks—totaling 500 billion renminbi (Rmb)—and medium-sized lenders (200 billion Rmb), relaxing enforcement of loan-to-deposit ratio rules to ease bank lending, etc, have been employed by the central bank this year. On its part, the government has accelerated the construction of railways and public housing projects and allowed local governments to relax property controls, amongst other things. Despite this, demand for loans is reported to be declining; manufacturers are getting pessimistic as a fragile external economy slows down trade; export growth moderated in the last two  months; while lead indications signal further weakness in the short term, increasing the likelihood of missing trade growth targets for the third consecutive year.
The second or a parallel reason for the ‘inevitable Chinese slowdown’ view is the visibly mounting evidence of leverage-induced stress. Total debt as share of GDP has jumped more than 100 points from 2009 to a 250% range according to several estimates—unsustainable by historical or any other standards; the indebtedness is spread across households, corporate, financial institutions and government; bad loans, defaults and bankruptcies are observably on the rise, as are falling profits and over-capacities in many segments. That growth is slowing despite all the monetary and other stimuli, a faster growth in credit over that of GDP, and investment growth is sustained in most segments including real estate despite declining sales lends credence to the ‘unsustainability and hence sharp slowdown’ view.
The emerging views, therefore, are that China’s growth has to slow down significantly as these excesses wear off, the economy regains health and reforms for a more maintainable reorientation towards a consumption-based model are implemented. In this process, investments across housing and industry will be impacted as credit-GDP growth slows; this will adversely affect consumption demand in turn; while the proposed financial sector reforms to lift caps on bank deposit rates, for instance, will cause interest rates to rise and negatively affect lending. A range of possible policy responses on the part of Chinese policymakers to contain the effects upon consumption and employment are also being considered: Inter alia, these include weakening the renminbi to retain competitiveness, especially in the light of its strengthening as the yen and euro lose value, lowering interest rates to boost demand, and delaying financial sector reforms.
Despite this overwhelmingly convincing evidence, can the possibility that China may still ride out these difficulties and stick to its avowed growth targets be excluded? The Chinese premier said very recently that the risks to its economy are not all that ‘scary’. And for long Chinese data has aroused suspicion. Besides the usual scepticism about the accuracy of official data, looking at the slides in cement, steel and electricity production, misreading could arise from other gaps; for example, fake invoicing that is often suspected to inflate Chinese exports; misgiving about the 1.08% official bad-loan rate for commercial banks considering that banks are believed to disguise the actual extent of delinquencies by rolling over or extending loans; declining sales reported by multinational firms against more robust official retail data; and so on. This increases the likelihood of misled understanding about the actual state of the Chinese economy and any hidden aces up the leadership’s sleeve. As in the past, China could yet again surprise and overturn current beliefs about the inevitability of a sharp slowdown. Interesting times lie ahead as we witness the battle of China views against the eventual, actual outcome.

Indias gold demand up 39% in SeptqtrGold futures price falls on global cues
India’s gold demand jumped 39% in the quarter through September to 225.1 tonne from a year before, far outperforming a 2% drop globally, as jewellery demand hit its loftiest since the first quarter of 2011, according to World Gold Council (WGC) data released on Thursday.  In value term, demand rose 31% from a year before to R56,219.30 crore in the last quarter.
Although gold demand recovered from a 39% slide in the June quarter, aided by consumption in the build-up to the festival season and a favourable base, it’s in sync with a long-term average, WGC managing director (India) Somasundaram PR told FE.
“The September quarter of last year was an aberration (gold demand was just 161.6 tonne), as the import duty on gold was raised to as high as 10% and the 80:20 rule was brought in by the Reserve Bank Of India to choke supplies in a bid to contain the current account deficit (CAD).
This year, the situation changed, as buyers were more or less convinced about a stability in government policies and went back to their normal buying pattern during the September quarter,” he said.
According to Somasundaram, despite the latest uptick, the country’s gold demand will probably hover around 900 tonne, down from 975 tonne last year.
Gold imports tumbled in the July-September period last year after the RBI in July imposed the 80:20 rule, mandating that 20% of imported gold be kept aside for re-export. Many exporters slowed down purchases, assuming they couldn’t ship out more than 20% of the imported gold.
The government in September clarified that those importing gold must ensure at least 20% of it goes for export, allaying the confusion and leading to a modest pick-up in imports.
Still, the stiff 80:20 rule, imposed after an exceptional surge in imports in the first half of 2013, prevented a sharp rise in purchases in the second half.
He said the government needs to tweak the 80:20 rule. “Instead of forcing jewellers to export, regulatory direction should be changed and incentives offered to bring about structural changes so that exports improve automatically and trade balance is restored in a sustained manner.
This will also boost domestic manufacturing and add jobs. That’s why both the authorities and industry should focus more on raising exports instead of choking raw material supplies.”
He added that it is essential to find ways of monetising household stocks, which stand at a record 22,000 tonne, to contain the CAD and also support economic growth.
Global gold demand declines 2% After a 16% drop in the June quarter, global gold demand got a leg-up from rising Indian consumption and narrowed the fall to just 2% to 929 tonne in the September quarter from a year earlier. Jewellery demand was down 4%, technology demand shed 5%, although investment demand inched up by 6%, the data showed.
“With recycling at a seven-year low and mine supply looking increasingly likely to be constrained in the future the outlook for physical gold demand remains strong,” WGC managing director of investment strategy Marcus Grubb said.

Tenders likely by March for turning Shendre-Bidkin  Dholera into smart citiesFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The government is hoping to float tenders for the development of Dholera and Shendre-Bidkin into smart cities by March 2015, a senior government official said on Thursday. The two areas form a part of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).
Shatrughna Singh, additional secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), said that the five industrial corridors planned in India will have several nodes consisting of industrial clusters and smart cities.
“Each of these nodes will require investments of R50,000-R75,000 crore,” Singh said on sidelines of FICCI’s Real Estate Summit 2014 in Mumbai.
Giving DMIC’s example, he said it has about 25 nodes, of which seven have been taken up in the first phase of development. “Master plan for five of these seven nodes has already been completed. On two of these five nodes, which is Dholera and Shendre-Bidkin trunk infrastructure will roll out by end of fiscal year 2014-2015,” Singh said.
The development of these nodes will be undertaken through a special purpose vehicle, which will have participation from state and central government, as well as private companies and funds. The SPV will be headed by a state government official. According to Singh, state’s equity participation will be in the form of land, while the central government will put in equal amount of money into the projects. Also, private sector and funding institutions could also be asked to invest in the projects.
He added that 35%-40% of the project cost will be for creating of trunk infrastructure which has to come from government funding while the remaining around 60-65% of the cost will be structured on PPP.
Meanwhile, to oversee the development of these industrial corridors, Singh said the Centre was in the process of forming a national corridor development authority by March 2015. “This authority will be responsible for the planning process of the industrial corridors as well as sourcing of funds,” he said.
Apart from DMIC, the other four industrial corridors include Amritsar Kolkata Industrial Corridor, Bangalore Mumbai Economic Corridor, Chennai Bangalore Industrial Corridor and Vishakhapatnam Chennai Industrial Corridor, which are expected to give a major push to the manufacturing sector in India.

Lack of clearances derails Mumbais metro ambitionsFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Mumbai’s plan of offering its citizens a fast and convenient mode of travel and decongesting the city’s streets suffered a setback on Thursday with the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure (R-Infra) announcing it was pulling out of the proposed Mumbai Metro Line 2 due to “non-fulfilment of various critical obligations” by the Maharashtra government.
Mumbai Metro Line 2 was planned as a 32-km metro corridor connecting Charkop in north Mumbai with Mankhurd in the east via the western suburb of Bandra. The project remained a non-starter for four years after the state government signed the concession agreement with the Mumbai Metro Transport (MMTPL), a consortium led by R-Infra, in January 2010.
The state government had called for international bids to award the metro project in August 2009. “Even after four years, despite best efforts of the government of Maharashtra, various project impediments could not be resolved,” R-Infra said in a statement on Thursday.
The agreement has been terminated mutually, “at no cost or claim to either party”.
The Maharashtra government will also return the R160-crore bank guarantee furnished by R-Infra, the statement said. A spokesperson for the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) said that it was yet to officially hear from R-Infra asking it to return the bank guarantee and it will begin the process of doing so when it received a formal request from the company.
The decision to mutually terminate the project was a formality after the viability of the project came into question with the state government deciding to re-examine the route may for Mumbai Metro Line 2 as it couldn’t attain environmental clearance for constructing a car depot in Mankhurd. The original project cost was pegged at R7,660 crore, which was later revised to R8,250 crore and according to the R-Infra statement issued on Thursday, the project was estimated to cost R12,000 crore.
The stand-off over non-availability of land for the car depot has been going on between R-Infra for the last two years. While MMRDA was urging MMTPL to start construction on the project, the consortium had taken a stand that it would not go ahead with the project unless the entire right of way and necessary environmental clearances were secured. In 2012, MMRDA referred the matter to the state government, asking it to take a decision regarding the project and the contract with MMTPL.
The state government has since drawn up a new plan for Mumbai Metro Line 2 that entails increasing the length of the corridor to 40 km from from Dahisar in north Mumbai till Mankhurd, via Charkop and Bandra. The proposed project cost is now being pegged at almost R29,000 crore.
Securing right of way in a congested city like Mumbai has been an impediment to infrastructure creation in the past as well. R-Infra, which also constructed the first phase of Mumbai’s metro rail, delivered the project after a considerable period of delay, which it blamed on inadequate right of way. The metro, which runs between Versova and Ghatkopar, has been operational since June, more than two years behind schedule.
The project eventually cost around R4,000 crore versus the originally estimated project cost of R2,356 crore.
Coming undone:
January 17, 2010: Concession agreement between Maharashtra and R-Infra – project cost revised to R8,250 crore
2010-2012: State government tries but fails to get green nod for the project; asks R-Infra to begin work. Company declines to go ahead without clearances
2014: State government decides to make the route 40 km-long, underground metro line. R-Infra pulls out on Thursday

Womenomics transforming Muslim worldNovember 13, 2014 12:57 pm
‘Womenomics’ is starting to transform the Muslim world
Saadia Zahidi
Saadia Zahidi receives the FT/McKinsey Bracken Bower Prize this week
The first convert to Islam was a businesswoman. She was a wealthy trader who inherited her father’s business and later expanded it into an even more impressive enterprise. At one point, she offered a job to a man. He accepted and conducted a trading mission from Mecca to Syria under the tutelage of his female boss.
Her name was Khadija. He was the Prophet Muhammad, and the two later married. Khadija’s personal loyalty to the Prophet and her financial independence were essential pillars of support in the early days spreading the message of Islam.

Debating Gutenberg
These facts highlight the unusual economic independence of the woman Muhammad married – and his approval of her sovereign existence. This history is often missing from the narrative within and about Islam – one of many reasons why women have not been a significant economic force in the Muslim world. But this is rapidly changing.
Today’s Muslim world is comprised of 1.6bn people. That is nearly a quarter of the global population, and they contribute about 16 per cent of global gross domestic product, growing at 6 per cent annually. It includes rich petro-states at the cusp of dramatic change such as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar, as well as members of what Goldman Sachs calls the “Next 11” : Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Iran.
Half of these people – 800m – are women. There is an untold, unfolding story hidden in their classrooms, in their careers, and in their purses. In just a generation or two, a widespread education movement has elevated the prospects of millions of women in these countries, from Tehran to Tunis.
Most governments in the region, especially those that possess oil wealth, have made massive investments in education over recent decades – rapidly closing primary and secondary education gender gaps from abysmally large starting points only 40 years ago.
The shift has also come in higher education. In Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Algeria, Oman, Jordan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, university enrolment rates for women exceed those for men.
These accelerations are massive, underreported and current. In Egypt, 10 years ago there were three women for every four men in university. Today those numbers are nearly equal. In resource-rich countries the figures are dramatic. In the UAE, women enrol in university at three times the rate of men. In Saudi Arabia, the university enrolment rates for women are higher than those in China, Mexico or Brazil.
What does all this mean? As female education becomes rooted and normalised, the next wave of change has come: women are now going to work. The past 10 years have triggered an exponential change that will one day be the stuff of history books. Nearly 40m more Muslim women are in the labour force than just a decade ago.
Millions of ordinary women and men have made conscious, and often deeply personal and brave decisions to break tradition, sometimes shunning cultural pressures. These myriad individual decisions will add up to a new segment of the labour market – and an unprecedented consumer power.
A movement has started where economics trumps culture. Changes that took half a century in the US are being compressed into a decade in today’s Muslim world, where they are set to continue at a significantly faster pace. Imagine if the US, in just a few years, had transformed from the 1950s era of The Feminine Mystique to Lean In in the 2010s. That is the magnitude of the change sweeping the Muslim world.

No output, but Nokia to keep Chennai factory in working condition for future buyers
Bharani Vaitheesvaran, ET Bureau Nov 14, 2014, 06.07AM IST

Delhi High Court
( With just 90 remaining…)
CHENNAI: No more phones to roll out and factory workers have left the company, but Nokia's Chennai plant has to keep its charge on. The 200-acre factory in Sriperambudur near Chennai has stopped production but the factory licence has to be renewed by end of November so that the machines run occasionally to keep themselves in working condition.
"Nokia wants to sell it off as a functional factory," a manager said of Nokia's plans. Without the licence, the plant is reduced to a godown for storing machines, which may drastically cut valuations.
Secondly, there is no benefit of uninterrupted power supply if it lets go of the factory licence. With just 90 remaining employees, the company will have to spend only about Rs 1 lakh to obtain the factory and allied licences.
Nokia's memorandum of understanding with Tamil Nadu ends by 2016, with this renewal being the last. The deal showered Nokia with sops, including land on a 99-year lease, power, tax, and electricity cost reimbursements, and several incentives as part of a drive to spur manufacturing in the state. But plans went astray for Nokia Chennai, once an employer of over 12,000 permanent staff and 25,000 on contract.
The company's shut-down story is now out in the open. In a Delhi High Court case last December, the Indian tax department had said Nokia's fixed assets such as the factory and a few sales offices are worth Rs 586 crore. "Now, it would be much lower considering depreciation," the manager said, hinting at the value lost as every month creeps by.
What further clouds the factory's future is the tax cases originating from Delhi and state tax departments. The SEZ plant was caught in tax-evasion cases when Nokia sold its mobiles devices business to Microsoft for 5.4 billion.
With an asset freeze on the factory now contested in court, the duration that Nokia will have to keep the machines running is uncertain.
Adding to that are the local issues that the plant will have to resolve. Nokia has filed documents for tax reimbursements amounting to Rs 98 crore, although it estimates the refund amount due to the company could be around Rs 450 crore.
GSrikanth, a tax practitioner and partner at GSV associates, says general complexity in tax system or improper paperwork could be working against firms seeking refund. In Nokia's case, a centralisation measure made it difficult to liaise with local tax authorities.

Stocks closed slightly higher Thursday as the Dow managed to post another record closing high but the S&P 500 fell just short.
In up and down trading, stocks initially jumped on better-than-expected Walmart earnings and news of several corporate deals. But the gains were cut as plunging oil prices dragged the energy sector lower.
Oil prices fell below $75 a barrel for the first time in four years as benchmark U.S. crude dropped $2.97, or 4%, to close at $74.21 Thursday. It is down 31% since late June to its lowest level since September of 2010.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.50 points, or 0.2%, to a record close of 17,652.79 and hit a new intraday record of 17,705.48.  The Dow was led higher by Walmart (WMT ) after the nation's largest retailer reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. Walmart shares jumped 4.7% to $82.94.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index eked out a gain of 1.08 points to 2039.33, just shy of its record close of 2039.68 set Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.01 points, or 0.1%, to 4680.14.
Energy stocks taking a hit on falling oil prices: ExxonMobil (XOM) dropped 0.8% to $94.66 and Chevron (CVX) fell 1% to $116.45.
In corporate merger news:
• Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA , BRKB ) announced it is buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble (PG) in a deal valued at $4.7 billion.
• Shares of Dreamworks Animation (DWA) surged 14% to $25.52 on reports that toymaker Hasbro (HAS) was in talks to buy the film studio. Hasbro was down 4.3% to $54.98.

"There's been a lot of momentum (up) in recent weeks, and a pause is probably a healthy development," said Jim Russell, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor, an investment firm. "We can see a scenario in which the market takes a time out, and reconsolidates for few days."
Overseas, Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1.1% to close at 17,392.79, as machinery orders there rose 2.9% over the previous month, defying predictions of a decline. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.3% to 24,019.94 and the Shanghai composite fell 0.4% to 2485.61.
European benchmarks were higher, with Britain's FTSE gaining 0.4% to 6635.45, Germany's DAX climbing 0.4% to 9248.51 and France's CAC 40 up 0.2% to 4187.95.
Wednesday, markets retreated slightly as six big banks were fined $4.3 billion in a settlement over foreign exchange manipulation charges, although the Nasdaq still managed to gain 0.3%.

Women in Business  Shruti Malani KrishnanWomen in Business – Shruti Malani Krishnan
Charlotte Clarke
Shruti Malani Krishnan is an MBA graduate of London Business School and director of Powr of You , a personal data marketplace helping people to receive payment for their data while remaining anonymous. She co-founded the start-up in 2013 with her brother Keshav Malani, who joined LBS the year after her.
Ms Malani Krishnan grew up in Kolkata, India then moved to California at the age of 14 and went on to study for a degree in economics at the University of California Berkeley. After graduating in 2005, she worked at Accenture for five years, in IT and operations practices, before joining LBS.

In her spare time, Ms Malani Krishnan enjoys learning different forms of dance and how to make jewellery and mosaic art.
1. Why did you choose to do an MBA?
After studying and working for five years in the US, I wanted to attend a top programme outside the US, in a location where I could see myself professionally in the future. So I applied to LBS and the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad and was accepted to both. I decided to attend LBS for two reasons: (1) almost 90 per cent of the class comes from outside the UK – this international diversity is still lacking in US MBAs I feel – and (2) I met a female student at an LBS information session whose experience as an engineer moving into private equity convinced me LBS would be a great match. It was inspiring that she could make that transition.
2. What is your favourite memory of business school?
I wouldn’t say favourite, but one memory that stands out is when we talked about tax and accounting practices in Turkey, in an 8:15am class and it turned into an interesting discussion. This shows what an international group of students can bring to the table.
On a personal note, I enjoyed the evening walks around Regent’s Park with my now husband. We would get into discussions about things like start-up ideas, scientific endeavours and ethics.
3. If you could do it all again, what would you do differently?
I would probably take more entrepreneurship courses. Starting my MBA, I knew I wanted to go into strategy consulting for three to five years then start my own business, so I focused my coursework on finance and marketing. I missed out on taking entrepreneurship courses because of this, so would love to go back and take those. I have since met the entrepreneurship faculty while working on Powr of You and found their advice extremely useful.
4. What would you do if you were dean of a business school for the day?
Encourage everyone to at least try starting a business, even if it’s just for fun. It teaches you an incredible amount about the world of business.
5. What advice would you give to female MBA graduates?
Challenge yourself. Don’t just go for the option that seems safe but ask yourself if the position you are taking on is truly going to be a learning experience or just one where you know you will be comfortable.
My advice to everyone in their 20s and 30s, in fact, is that any time you feel you are comfortable in the job/role you are doing, it is time for a change because you are too young to not be pushing yourself to be better.
6. Why did you decide to launch Powr of You?
Simply put, we saw a disconnect between consumers and brands and a way to connect them that could benefit everyone. All the data we already share online is quite valuable to companies to understand consumer behaviour and preferences so they can tailor both marketing and innovation efforts. With Powr of You, users earn rewards with our revenue share model and get a service to actively manage their online presence. On the other side, our analytics engine churns this data to help brands plug into their consumers’ lives.
We are live in beta now on the web and launching our Android app in November so we are focusing on growing the platform at the moment. Helping people unlock the value of personal data can truly transform lives for the better.
7. How do you deal with male-dominated environments?
I love Shakespeare so an apt quote I always keep in mind is: “This above all. To thine own self be true”. Also, find a mentor who can be your guide, female or male.
8. What is your favourite business book?
The biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. It is a great read on how one of the greatest minds came about; how creativity wasn’t learned, in his case, but a way of life from pranks as a kid to innovations as chief executive of Apple.
9. How do you deal with pressure?
Any time I feel overwhelmed, I make a list. It seems to do the trick. Write things down and prioritise. I am in love with the Wunderlist app for that reason.
10. What are your top tips for networking?
Be genuine. Don’t try to talk to everyone that seems important and ask generic questions. Rather, figure out whom you want to talk to and why you want to talk to them. In business school especially you go to so many different events.

Hindalco net profit falls 78% on coalgate fine provisioning

( Analysts, on an average,…)
MUMBAI: Hindalco Industries reported a second quarter net profit of Rs 78.8 crore, down 78% from Rs 357.1 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, as the aluminium maker set aside funds for a pending fine on coal mining as directed by the Supreme Court and for a poorly performing unit in Australia. Sales at the Aditya Birla group's flagship grew 36% to Rs 8,472.9 crore. Analysts, on an average, were expecting a profit of Rs 423.4 crore on sales of Rs 8,307.9 crore, according to a Bloomberg poll.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization grew 37% toRs 1,120 crore. Exceptional expenses included provisioning for fine of Rs 563 crore for using coal from operational, but now de-allocated, Talabira 1 mine in Odisha and a charge of Rs 258 crore on its underperforming investment in Aditya Birla Mineral in Australia. However, the exceptional expenses were offset to some extent by a foreign exchange gain of Rs 361 crore and a write back of provision of Rs 29 crore in state taxes.
Hindalco is waiting for key coal linkages after it lost all its captive coal mines, both functional and allotted, to Supreme Court judgement in September. Aluminium producers in India need low-cost coal to produce energy intensive aluminium and remain profitable.
Its profitability has already been eroded to a great extent because of buying coal at market prices. Power and fuel costs shot up 47% to Rs 1,293.9 crore during the quarter. But despite coal scarcity, Hindalco has continued to ramp up its new smelters. "Important point is that projects are ramping up well, we are at a stage, where we are seeing the end of the tunnel. The coal uncertainty will go away in the next few months so if it all goes as we see it we have better days to come," CFO Praveen Maheshwari told ET.
Hindalco can keep using coal from Talabira 1 mine only till this fiscal end, after which it will have to rebid for all the mines again. Hindalco's exposure to other coal blocks, which were not yet functional, stands at Rs 269 crore.
He said Hindalco has started evaluating suitable mines for bidding, considering the distance between the mine and plant. He added Hindalco could look at bidding for coal blocks in partnership with other firms. Maheshwari is not too worried about coal scarcity hurting Hindalco in the future, considering 170 new coal blocks are coming up for bidding. "I presume that coal production and availability should go up significantly.
The shortage that we see today in the medium term should go away," he added. He also clarified that Hindalco would do a Qualified institutional placement (QIP) at an 'opportune time' if at all.

Fadnavis govt invalid; ask it to prove majority: Shiv Sena to Maharashtra GovernorMBA student alleges sexual assault in Mathura
Sharpening its attack on the Devendra Fadnavis government for its “manipulative” victory in the trust vote in Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, Shiv Sena yesterday met Governor C Vidyasagar Rao here and demanded that it should be declared a “minority” government and he should order a fresh confidence motion.
The former ally of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that Fadnavis government with current strength of 10 ministers is “invalid” as it fails to fulfil the provisions of Article 164.
Senior Sena leader Diwakar Raote said they have requested the Governor to ask BJP to prove majority “or else declare it a minority government and seek a fresh trust vote.”
“The President of India has appointed Governor to uphold the Constitution. But if the government itself is unconstitutional (then) is it not his duty to take action in the interest of people?,” Raote told PTI after meeting Rao at Raj Bhavan.
The fledgling BJP government won the trust motion in the Assembly through a voice vote yesterday, drawing angry reactions from Shiv Sena and Congress which have accused the ruling BJP of failing to prove its majority and “strangulating democracy”.
Terming the Fadnavis-led government as “illegitimate” which is formed by “violating” the constitutional provisions, Raote said, “Our delegation, led by (Leader of Opposition Eknath Shinde) has reminded the governor that this (BJP) government is an invalid government as per (provisions of) constitution.
“When it has only 10 ministers, how have they fulfilled the provision of Article 164 of the constitution?,” Raote questionned.
Article 164 (1A) provides that strength of council of ministers headed by the CM cannot exceed 15 per cent of the strength of the Assembly (the total number of MLAs) but it can’t be less than 12 members either.
Besides Shinde and Raote, the delegation comprised Pratap Sarnaik, Neelam Gorhe, Sunil Prabhu, Deepak Sawant and Ajay Chowdhary.
Raote alleged that minds of people have been “muddled” by the BJP, and that the party failed to provide clarity on the total number of legislators who voted for the party during the trust vote.
The withdrawal of PPAC in July had resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
PPAC is a surcharge given to the discoms to compensate variations in the market-driven fuel costs like additional costs on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
According to DERC figures, the private discoms operating in the city have a revenue gap of a whopping Rs 19,500 crore.
Official figures show that around 80-90 per cent of total revenue of discoms goes into purchasing power from central and state government owned entities through long-term power purchase agreement, at rates determined by the central and state regulators.
The city has seen a series of hike in power tariff in the past two years.
The tariff was hiked by 22 per cent in 2011 followed by five per cent hike in February 2012. The tariff was increased by up to two per cent in May 2012 year and again by 26 per cent for domestic consumers in July 2012.
It was hiked by up to three per cent in February last year and again by five per cent in August last.
The cost of buying power has increased primarily on account of an increase in the input prices of raw material like coal and gas, officials said.

Battle over Nehru legacy escalates; Congress attacks Narendra ModiMBA student alleges sexual assault in Mathura
The battle over Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy escalated yesterday with Congress launching a sharp but veiled attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of seeking to destroy his secular vision and spreading “poison of communalism”.
The Congress’ criticism of Modi, whom it accuses of appropriating the legacy of freedom movement leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, came at two functions to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru.
Though Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul did not name the Prime Minister, the reference was obvious.
Speaking at the first event organised by the party, Sonia Gandhi asked Congressmen to fight those out to demolish Nehru’s “liberal India”.
Later in the evening, speaking at the Jawaharlal Nehru memorial lecture event, she said that the legacy of every great political leader is often subject to revisionism of some type or other.
“But what is being attempted on Jawaharlal Nehru by those who are ideologically hostile to him is the total rejection of his secular vision of a tolerant and liberal India celebrating its many diversities.
“Those who castigate him choose also to be oblivious of the larger political and historical context of his times in which the state had to be the principal catalyst for socio-economic transformation,” Gandhi said.
Out of power for the last six months after a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, the party is utilising the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru to rally round non-NDA parties on a platform raising the pitch of secularism.
It has organised an international meet on November 17 and 18 for which it has not invited Modi.
Sonia Gandhi has extended invitations personally to leaders including Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee.
At the Nehru memorial event, inviting President Pranab Mukherjee to deliver the lecture, Gandhi said that we must continue to fiercely fight for the idea for which Nehru stood and always upheld.
“And if I might add, so is the idea of Nehru as well, an idea that belongs to not one political party or narrow segment but indeed to the entire country and humanity at large.”
At the Congress event, speaking in the presence of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, she asked partymen to be united and strengthen the organisation and connect and fight those forces that are out to demolish Nehru’s vision of a liberal India.
“Massive attempts are on to destroy the vision of Nehru the way he used to look at India. The forces, which are doing this are targeting not only his persona but also his ideology, his vision, his life-long contributions and struggle,” she said.
The Congress President said that had Nehru been alive, he would have asked all Congressmen to fight communalism of all hues by becoming a “valiant secular soldier” for protecting the soul of India.
In his speech, Rahul Gandhi said that “angry” people are nowadays running the country and had a dig at Modi over the “Swachchta Abhiyan” saying “photo opportunities” are galore.
“These days, the foundation of love and brotherhood is being demolished. On the one hand houses are being painted and roads are being cleaned. Photo opportunities are happening. Snaps are being taken. On the other hand, poison is being spread. The very foundations are being weakened,” he said.
At the other event, Sonia Gandhi said that while given Nehru’s towering stature intellectually and politically, one often tends to think that he governed unchallenged.
“Not so. His 17 years as Prime Minister were a time when there were sharp ideological differences and even passionate policy disagreements, a time when the course he charted for a newly independent country was often called into question.
“Yet he reached across the political spectrum to exchange views and ideas with critics on major issues of the day, never shying away from engaging with his detractors. Nehru’s most bitter antagonists acknowledged that he was free from malice, from mean-mindedness, from parochial instincts and, above all from hate and fear,” she said.
She also hailed Mukherjee, who delivered the key note address on Nehru saying “Politics apart, he has been among the most thoughtful and well-read personalities in public life.”
Lauding the President for his unmatched breadth of knowledge and depth of understanding of the crosscurrents of Indian society and politics, Sonia Gandhi said, “A man of politics, a man of letters, a man of wisdom and experience – we could think of no most appropriate personality to deliver this year’s lecture.”
At the outset she said about Nehru that the structures of the government and economy, the very ethos and principles which shaped modern India, would have been very different had it not been for his vision, his leadership, and his tremendous commitment and hard work during our country’s formative years.
“Nehru was pre-eminent amongst those remarkable men and women, who inspired and led by Mahatma Gandhi freed India from colonial domination. Nehru assumed office at the most traumatic time when the horrors of Partition were unfolding and when the country lost Mahatma Gandhi.
“He steered India through this most turbulent period and placed it firmly on the path of Parliamentary democracy and planned development. This is what gave rise to the Nehruvian consensus that has stood us well these past six decades,” she said.
Gandhi also said that India’s achievements would not have been possible without the solid foundations established under Nehru’s leadership.
“The fact that we are a Parliamentary democracy anchored in liberal values, the fact that we celebrate our many diversities, the fact that we are strong internationalists, the fact that we see that we see social equality and empowerment as absolutely essential aspects of economic development — all these are largely Nehru’s legacy,” she claimed.
In the morning event, the Congress President said, “A person with so much power and authority and enjoying such love and trust could have taken the country to any direction.
“But it was his deep conviction in justice and liberty that he took the country on a path in which institutions were given more importance than an individual. He engaged in a politics, which allowed play to all kinds of thoughts.”
She also reminded Congressmen that the history of Congress is 129 years old and it has always remained vibrant and weathered many difficulties and faced many storms with every crisis giving it a new strength.
At the function, Dikshit administered oath to Congress workers in the name of Nehru to commit themselves to the ideals of secularism, pluralism and progressiveness espoused by him.

PM Narendra Modi arrives in AustraliaMBA student alleges sexual assault in Mathura
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today arrived here in Australia on the second leg of his three-nation tour during which he will attend the annual G20 summit and hold bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott.
Modi reached Brisbane after attending the ASEAN-India summit and the East Asia Summit on November 12-13 in the Myanmarese capital Nay Pyi Taw.
The Prime Minister is on a 10-day visit of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji to attend key multilateral summits and undertake bilateral meetings.
Before his departure from India, Modi had said the importance of global cooperation against black money will be a “key issue” he will highlight at the G20 summit.
“A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money,” Modi had said in a pre-departure statement.
As India attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad, Modi is expected to renew the country’s commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
At the annual summit of the Group of 20 of the world’s biggest developed and emerging economies, Modi had said he intends to discuss how it can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure, and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The two-day summit will be held from November 15. G20 accounts for 85 per cent of the world’s economic output.
During his visit, Modi will also hold talks with Prime Minister Abbott in Canberra after the G20 summit.
Modi is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.
“While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential.
“A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India’s economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood,” he said referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney besides Canberra.

Berkshire to buy Duracell from P&G in $4.7 b...Berkshire Hathaway to acquire Duracell battery from Procter & Gamble in $4.7 billion stock deal
Bloomberg Nov 14, 2014, 06.37AM IST

Berkshire Hathaway
("Duracell will have about…)
NEW YORK: Berkshire Hathaway agreed to buy the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble in chairman Warren Buffett's latest stock swap. Berkshire will turn over $4.7 billion of P&G shares held by Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based company, according to a Business Wire statement on Thursday.
Duracell will have about $1.7 billion in cash when the deal is completed, which is expected in the second half of next year, according to the statement. The exchange may help Berkshire cut its holding in Cincinnati-based P&G without incurring the tax costs of selling shares in the open market.
Buffett became one of P&G's biggest shareholders through an investment in Gillette. P&G bought the razor maker in 2005 in a $57-billion deal that the Berkshire chairman supported.
Berkshire held more than 100 million shares as recently as 2008 and cut the stake several times since then as the company faltered under previous CEO Bob McDonald. "I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette," Buffett said in the statement.
P&G announced last month that it would divest Duracell. CEO AG Lafley has been streamlining the company, cutting expenses and selling noncore businesses. P&G sold its pet-food business and has said it will jettison up to 100 of its slower-selling brands. Paying with shares would mirror two of Buffett's transactions in the past year, when he swapped stock that had appreciated for operating businesses.
He handed over a holding in Phillips 66 in February in exchange for its pipeline-flowimprover unit. In July, he swapped a stake in former Washington Post publisher, Graham Holdings , for cash, a Miami TV station and Berkshire stock that Graham held. Buffett had about 52 million P&G shares at the end of last year, a stake worth more than $4 billion.

BSE Sensex, Nifty Trade Flat; IT Stocks Gain
NDTV | Updated On: November 14, 2014 09:52 (IST)
BSE Sensex and Nifty were mostly flat today with buying in IT, oil & gas, and auto stocks keeping the markets supported.
Sensex was up nearly 30 points to 27,969 while Nifty edged higher to 8,366.
Market analyst Sarvendra Srivastava says Nifty remains in the 8200-8400 range and until 8180 levels are held on, the momentum is in favour of bulls. If Nifty breaks out above 8,400 levels decisively, the index could see further 400-500 point gains, he added.
Some buying was seen in IT stocks, with Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro up between 0.60 per cent and 0.90 per cent.
Some oil & gas stocks also attracted some buying action after seeing sharp losses yesterday. ONGC rose nearly 1 per cent while HPCL gained 1.5 per cent. Global oil prices slumped to four-year-lows of below $80/barrel. Though a slide in global oil prices reduces the subsidy burden of Indian oil companies, analysts are not positive on PSU oil marketing companies.
Lancelot D'Cunha, CEO of ITI Wealth Management, said the government has the power to regulate fuel prices or introduce new duties which can reduce their profits, referring to the excise duty hike. Government policies can change the financials or valuations of the oil retailers and their valuations are also very high after the recent run-up in their shares, he added.
BPCL and HPCL were down marginally today.

PM arrives in Australia to attend G20 summitModi arrives in Australia; to highlight black money issue at G20 summit

Brisbane, Nov 14:  
As India attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will push for stepping up global cooperation against the key issue of cross border tax avoidance and evasion at the G20 summit starting here tomorrow.
Modi, who is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, arrived here on a five-day trip to Australia on the second leg of his 10-day three-nation tour.
He will also undertake a bilateral visit to the Australian capital Canberra for talks with Premier Tony Abbott on Tuesday.
Concerns over 'jobless growth' prospects
The Prime Minister will also utilise the two-day 9th G20 summit of the world’s biggest developed and emerging economies, to flag India’s concerns over “jobless growth” prospects.
Ahead of the summit, Modi felt that focusing on transforming the quality of life of people and not just on issues like the health of the financial markets was necessary for creating employment-generating economic growth.
It was a bright and sunny day at Brisbane as Modi stepped out of his Special Air India plane at the international airport after an overnight flight from Myanmar capital Nay Phi Taw where he attended two back-to-back international summits and had a string of bilateral meetings.
“Reached Brisbane. It is bright and sunny outside,” Modi tweeted.
Modi was received at the airport by the Queensland Premier Campbell Newman among others. Indian High Commissioner in Australia Biren Nanda was also present.
“A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money,” Modi had said, as he is set to renew the country’s commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
Next gen infrastructure
Modi had also said he intends to discuss how G20 can accelerate the creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The G20 includes 19 individual countries — Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the US — and the European Union (EU).
Collectively, the G20 economies account for around 85 per cent of the GDP, 80 per cent of world trade and two-thirds of the world population. The G20 was launched in 2008 in the US.
Focus of G20 summit
Jobs and growth will remain the focus of the G20 summit, despite strenuous lobbying to shift the spotlight to climate change and Ebola.
Australia, which holds the G20 presidency, today re-emphasised the summit’s mission when Treasurer Joe Hockey stressed upon the heavy burden on group members “to get real outcomes''.
“We have a plan before the leaders of the world to grow the world economy, to create the jobs that are necessary, to lift people out of poverty, and we are determined to deliver that,” he said.
Modi, referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, besides Canberra, had earlier said, “While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential.”
“A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India’s economic goals, promote our security interests, including maritime security, and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood,” he said.
Indian officials said that the Prime Minister’s trip will be a “landmark visit” and is aimed at “re-engaging” Australia.
Agenda for G20 summit
Prime Minister Abbott had a telephonic talk with Modi before his departure from India to discuss the agenda for the multilateral meeting and he asked the Indian leader to share, in particular, his vision for accelerating global economic growth and employment generation.
Abbott conveyed that he and the Australian people were keenly awaiting the visit of Modi, who appreciated his personal attention to his visit and emphasised the importance he attached to his Australia visit as a step towards qualitatively transforming a relationship that he greatly values.

Viscera samples of Sunanda may be sent abroadMBA student alleges sexual assault in Mathura
Delhi Police are considering sending viscera samples of former union minister Shashi Tharoor’s wife Sunanda Pushkar, who was found dead in a hotel here in January, to forensic laboratories abroad to determine the type of poison that is suspected to have caused her death.
The AIIMS medical board had, in its second report submitted to police recently, confirmed poisoning as the reason behind her death but did not mention the type of poison that caused her death.
They had listed some kind of poisons most of which were radioactive isotopes that cannot be detected by labs in India.
According to a senior police official, police are now mulling sending the viscera samples to a UK-based laboratory which has facilities to test all kinds of poisons.
“With this almost clear that Sunanda died of poisoning, the biggest question which remains in the case is that the kind of poison (used) and how it reached her body. If these question can be answered, the case could head to its logical end,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
As of now, the police have asked the AIIMS panel of doctors to redo their investigation and name the poison which caused Sunanda’s death but if it fails to do so, the samples will then be sent abroad.
The three mobile phones and a laptop of the deceased have already been sent to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for investigations to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets post her death.
Today too, police questioned some people who were related to the case but senior officials refused to divulge the identities of these people and what they told police.
The AIIMS panel of doctors had earlier said the police had not shared with it the photographs of scene of occurrence, statements and circumstantial evidences with them.
Police had not quizzed a single person in the last nine months nor did it try to inspect the ‘crime’ scene.
As the police try to reinvestigate the case from scratch, there are two possibilities in the case, first is that the police register a fresh FIR in the case and second it closes investigations stating that no foul play was found.
It was only after the AIIMS report that the police got suite number 345 of Leela Palace Hotel, where Pushkar was found dead, opened.
Police had also called upon the AIIMS doctors and experts from FSL to inspect the room during which fluid marks were found on Sunanda’s bed sheet, the carpet and a broken glass in the room. These articles have also been sent to forensic labs for examination.
The suite of the five star hotel, had remained sealed and was opened for the first time since the incident.
Police had also got information regarding Pushkar’s twin email accounts from Yahoo and Google with details of whom she was in touch during her last days.
A list of these people through their IP addresses was made by the police and they were quizzed about the conversations.
Their statements are now being tallied with each other and also with those which were recorded before the SDM during the initial investigation.
The medical board concluded that Pushkar’s vital organs like kidney, lungs and liver were functioning normally and that her death was caused by poisoning.
Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi had said the fresh reports submitted to them were “inconclusive” and “based on conjecture”.

Saradha scam prime accused and ex-Trinamool MP Kunal Ghosh reportedly attempts suicide injailTMC MP Kunal Ghosh at CBI custody (Source: Express file photo by Subham Dutta)
Written by Madhuparna Das | Kolkata | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:21 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 8:16 pm
One of the prime accused in the multi crore Saradha chit fund scam, Kunal Ghosh – a former Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabbha Member tried to commit suicide at Presidency Corrctional Home in Kolkata late last night where he was lodged for past several months. Ghosh was rushed to SSKM hospital in the wee hours of Friday when prison guards reportedly noticed him lying in his cell in an “abnormal position“ with some sleeping pill strips lying by his side.
The jail doctor was summoned immeaitely and Kunal Ghosh was moved to the SSKM hospital at about 3 am wher ehe told the attendign doc tor that he had consumed about 30/40 sleeping pills. The doctors immedaitely washed his stomach and by late afternoon his condition was stated to be stable in the CCU.

Kunal Ghosh lived upto his threat just three days ago. On November 10, while being taken to City Civil court at Bankshal in Kolkata for production, he had shouted at the waiting media persons from the prison van saying that he would commit suicide within three days if the real culprits in the Saradha case were not arrested by the CBI. He alleged that the police had let free the actual culprits while he was rotting in the jail. Earlier, too, he had pointed fingers at several top Trinamool Congress leaders for their alleged complicity in the Saradha scam and demanded that they should be arrested and prosecuted.
However, as the day grew, the state government suspended in quick succession the Jail superintendent, the medical offier and the prion guard pending by the police to ascertain the facts and circumstances of how Kunal Ghosh attenpted suicide inside the prison cell. By all standardes it was surprising as to how could he lay his hands on such a large number of sleeping pills.

The Prisidency Correctional home, the Alipore Correctional home and other central jails in Kolkata are notorious for instances when various banned items have been “smugglinged in” for jail inmates – from lifers to the ordinary. Obviously, there existed well established channels within the prisons with active collusion with prison staff for maintaining such illegal supply chains to the prison inmates from continued…

Snapdeal logs onto rural India; 5K e-commerc..."I am going into this thinking that we will be able to reach 5-10 crore new consumers in the next three years," Kunal Bahl, co-founder and CEO of Snapdeal, told TOI. At present, Snapdeal has around 3 crore registered users.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Online retail is poised for a hyper jump into rural India. To go one up on archrival Flipkart, Snapdeal - one of the country's largest e-tailers - plans to tap 50 lakh low-income households in slums and villages across the country. These include places such as Dharavi (Mumbai), which is Asia's largest slum, Govindpuri, one of the biggest slums in Delhi, and villages in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana, among many others.
Snapdeal will launch around 5,000 e-commerce kiosks across 65 cities and 70,000 rural areas by the end of next year with the help of FINO PayTech , an Indian financial inclusion solutions company. These e-commerce centers will be manned by village-level entrepreneurs, have personal computers and tablets, and also serve as collection and delivery points of packages since most people living in these areas usually have no permanent addresses. Additionally, they will help consumers with zero internet connectivity to shop online.
"I am going into this thinking that we will be able to reach 5-10 crore new consumers in the next three years," Kunal Bahl , co-founder and CEO of Snapdeal, told TOI. At present, Snapdeal has around 3 crore registered users.
Interestingly, initial pilot runs by these kiosks have revealed that the average ticket size of purchases by rural consumers is not too far behind that of urban consumers. "It is Rs 1,400 compared to Rs 2,000 from urban areas," said Bahl.
Snapdeal will be offering a special assortment of utility-cum-aspirational products, such as speakers, juicers, solar lanterns, diner sets, cameras and mobile phones. These products will be curated on an exclusive page that will require login by a FINO agent, who would place an order, collect payment, receive and deliver to people who have no permanent address.
"This channel has great potential. For instance, we call people from Dharavi the HNIs (high net worth individual) of slums," said Rishi Gupta, executive director and COO of FINO PayTech.

Tata Power Posts Rs 78 Crore Loss in September Quarter
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 13, 2014 23:05 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Tata Power on Thursday posted a consolidated loss of Rs 78 crore for the September quarter as the company was impacted by lower revenues from coal business, among other factors.
The leading power producer had a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 75 crore in the July-September quarter of last fiscal.
On a standalone basis, the company's the profit after tax in the second quarter of the current fiscal rose to Rs 306 crore from Rs 262 crore in the year-ago period.
Its revenue on consolidated basis fell to Rs 8,394 crore from Rs 8,765 crore in the year-ago period. This was due to lower realisation by coal companies, and lower fuel cost in Mumbai operations, Tata Power said in a statement.
The company's bottom line was hit mainly "due to lower coal prices impacting profitability of coal mines".
However, it added: "All other operations have performed well. The company has also made provision for certain expenses pertaining to coal mines following de-allocation of coal mines by the Supreme Court."
According to the company, the Q2 revenue from coal business was Rs 2,079 crore, compared to Rs 2,324 crore in the corresponding period last year.
Despite falling global coal prices, losses in coal companies have been minimised by prudent cost control measures, it added.
Meanwhile, the loss of CGPL narrowed to Rs 274 crore in the latest September quarter. It was at Rs 297 crore in the same period a year ago.
Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL) is operating the 4,000 MW Mundra ultra mega power project, which is facing tariff issues in the wake of changes in pricing norms for Indonesian coal. The plant, located in Gujarat, is fired by coal imported from Indonesia.
Tata Power CEO and managing director Anil Sardana said that in the second quarter, the company reported robust operational performance by its businesses maximising shareholder value.
"We await and are hopeful of a quick resolution of India's fuel issues including the unprecedented rise of imported coal prices and issues around domestic coal," he said.

Rupee weakens to 61.63 on dollar demandRupee slumps to 61.75 on heavy dollar demand

Mumbai, Nov 14:  
The rupee was trading weak by 20 paise at 61.75 against the dollar at 4.00 p.m. local time at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market today due to heavy demand for the American currency from banks and importers.
The domestic unit hovered in the range of 61.60 and 61.83 in the afternoon trade.
According to forex dealers, besides the dollar gaining strength against other currencies in the global market on the back of a strong US economy, increased demand for the American unit from importers weighed on the rupee, but a firm domestic equity market capped the fall.
The rupee had finished lower by four paise at 61.55 against the American unit in yesterday’s trade on renewed dollar demand from banks and importers.
Meanwhile, the 30-share BSE index Sensex ended higher by 106.02 points at 28,046.66.

Crude oil rebounds in AsiaCrude oil rebounds in Asia

Singapore, Nov 14:  
Oil prices bounced back in Asia today after diving to fresh lows in the previous session on expectations that OPEC is unlikely to cut the production levels to counter a global supply glut.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for December delivery rose 27 cents to $74.48, while Brent crude for January delivery gained 61 cents to $78.10 in mid-morning trade.
WTI crude plunged $2.97 in New York trade on Thursday, while Brent crude for December delivery dived $2.46 in London on the last day of the contract.
“We are seeing a slight rise in oil prices at the moment, but the key driver is still bearish sentiment about any possible OPEC production cut,” Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.
“Rightly or wrongly, we are seeing price adjustments in anticipation of OPEC not doing anything about global oversupply, or not doing enough,” he added.
US petroleum report
Concerns about a global supply glut were exacerbated after the latest US petroleum report by the Department of Energy released on Thursday showed the country produced 9.063 million barrels per day in the week ended November 7.
That marked the highest production since at least January 1983 when the department began publishing the statistics.
US crude reserves at the oil hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, closely watched by traders because they serve as reference for WTI traded in New York, jumped by 1.7 million barrels last week to 22.5 million barrels.
OPEC meet
Dealers are largely expecting the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to decide against reducing output to stem the global supply glut, in part caused by a flood of oil extracted from shale rock in the US.
OPEC’s next meeting is set for November 27 in Vienna, home to the cartel’s headquarters.

Kunal Ghosh attempts  suicide   hospitalisedSuspended TMC MP accused Kunal Ghosh attempts ‘suicide’, hospitalised
By: PTI |        Kolkata |  November 14, 2014 9:56 am
Summary
Kunal Ghosh, a journalist by profession, is a former CEO of Saradha Group firm Bengal Media Ltd.
Other Articles
Suspended Trinamool Congress MP and Saradha scam accused Kunal Ghosh today allegedly tried to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills inside the Alipore Central Jail, West Bengal Correctional Home Services Minister H A Swafi said.
Ghosh has been admitted to a state-run hospital.
“Kunal Ghosh claimed that he has taken sleeping pills to commit suicide. He later on called the doctor and they found everything to be normal but still as a precautionary measure we did not take any chance and got him admitted to the SSKM Hospital,” the minister told PTI here.
Doctors there have kept Ghosh, an accused in the Saradha scam, under observation.
On November 10 when he was produced before a city court, Ghosh had threatened to commit suicide if the CBI did not take proper action against “those involved” within three days.
“Investigation is being influenced. It is not acceptable that I will rot in jail while those involved will roam freely. I am giving three days’ time, if action is not taken I will commit suicide,” the suspended Trinamool Congress MP had told Metropolitan Magistrate Arvind Mishra at Bankshall Court here.
“I pray to you to pass an order that during these three days, none of my relatives or my lawyer be allowed to meet me or else I may get influenced and dissuaded,” Ghosh, who had during earlier court hearings accused some top Trinamool Congress leaders of having benefited from the scam, told the judge on that day.
Ghosh, a journalist by profession, is a former CEO of Saradha Group firm Bengal Media Ltd.
A top jail department official said, “As he had threatened (to commit suicide), we had kept extra watch on him for the past two days. Before going to sleep we searched him thoroughly. But no sedative or sleeping pill of that sort was found in his possession.
“But at around 2:30 AM he started complaining of breathlessness and claimed he had taken pills following which jail doctors called on him, examined him thoroughly but did not find anything abnormal. Still we did not take any chance,” the official told PTI.

Walmart To Kick Off Black Friday Sales At 6 P.M. On ThanksgivingWalmart To Kick Off Black Friday Sales At 6 P.M. On Thanksgiving

Walmart is joining other retailers in turning Black Friday from a one-day shopping bonanza to a multiday event, the company announced Wednesday.
The big-box chain will kick off its deal spree just after midnight on Thanksgiving at Walmart.com and will offer doorbuster events at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. at all locations on Thanksgiving itself. Then beginning at 6 a.m. on Black Friday -- the day traditionally reserved for post-Thanksgiving shopping -- the retailer will offer more discounts on everything from iPhones to Fisher-Price toys.
“Black Friday is no longer an event for customers who wake up at the crack of dawn to get good deals,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S., told reporters on a conference call Tuesday, adding that the event has really turned into "Black Friday week" at several retailers.
Though Walmart has offered Thanksgiving shopping hours since 1988, it did not come under much criticism for doing so until more recently, when a number of other retailers began keeping their doors open on the holiday as well. Critics say the day should be set aside for spending time with family. Detractors have also protested outside dozens of Walmart stores on past Thanksgivings and Black Fridays to draw attention to Walmart workers who say they're paid very little and are subject to poor working conditions.
Walmart associates who work their regular hours during the week of Thanksgiving will receive holiday pay -- a rate that Walmart will go back as far as late summer to calculate. A Walmart worker who reports to work the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, for example, will receive their normal hourly wage, plus an additional sum equal to whatever their average daily wage was during the 12 weeks leading up to Thanksgiving. The more hours a worker logs during those 12 weeks, the higher their holiday pay will be.
The company estimates that it will dole out more than $70 million in holiday pay to hourly workers this season. In addition, employees who work on Thanksgiving can come in for one big shopping trip on either December 4 or 5 and get 25 percent off their total.
For his part, Mac Naughton said workers “get excited” to staff the event and see shoppers getting good deals. “The associates really, really like being there,” he said on the conference call.
A Walmart spokeswoman said that the retailer begins to organize its Thanksgiving staffing about three weeks before the holiday. The company relies on volunteers first and then schedules other workers to fill the remaining slots.
It’s not just workers who may be planning their turkey dinners around getting to the store. Last year, 22 million people shopped at Walmart on Thanksgiving Day.
This year, the retailer plans to attract shoppers with deals on things like iPad minis and 65-inch TVs for those customers who are in designated areas of the store between 6 and 7 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Starting at 8 p.m., Walmart will be offering deals on other electronics, like Beats by Dre headphones and Fitbit exercise trackers.
“It’s really about listening to our customer,” Mac Naughton said on the call with reporters. “Six o’clock and 8 o’clock were the times that [customers] told us gives them time to be with their family and celebrate Thanksgiving [before going out shopping]."
Walmart's competitors will also be kicking off Black Friday events at similar times. Target and Macy’s are both opening at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. The holiday shopping season is typically one of the most crucial periods of the year for retailers, which may explain in part why retailers have been racing to start it earlier.
Like other big-box stores, Walmart has struggled in recent months as more people move to do their shopping in smaller, more urban stores as well as online. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail metric, have been flat or declined at Walmart’s U.S. locations for the past six quarters.
The company will report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Government Sets Up Panel for Allocation of Cancelled Coal Blocks
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 12, 2014 20:12 (IST)
Government May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
To ensure smooth allocation of 204 cancelled coal blocks, the government has set up a high-level inter-ministerial panel that would advise on policy issues and interact with the industry.
The nine-member Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) under the Chairmanship of Additional Secretary Coal has members from the ministries like power, steel and law, the coal ministry said in an official communication.
     
It said the nominated authority created under the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 is required to undertake management and reallocation of 204 coal blocks cancelled by the Supreme Court. "In discharge of duties, the Nominated Authority is required to consult Central Government
on various policy matters."
     
It added: "The policy issues, which may come up for consideration and directions of the Central Government, would involve inputs of sectoral ministries viz power, steel and DIPP as well as concerned regulatory ministries viz. Finance (DEA), Law & Justice. Therefore it has been decided by the competent authority in this ministry to constitute an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC)."
     
IMC will also interact with the industry stakeholders, industry chambers like Ficci, CII, Coal Producer Association, Steel Manufacturer Association, Cement Producers Association etc in order to ascertain their views on the procedure and methodology of auction of coal block.
     
The panel will also advise on "any other issue referred by the Ministry of Coal in connection with coal block
allocations".
     
In a major blow to the corporate sector, the Supreme Court had in September quashed allocation of 204 coal blocks alloted to various companies since 1993 terming it as "fatally flawed", and allowed the Centre to take over operation of 42 such blocks which are functional.

India Flow Tide Has Turned Decisively: Citi ResearchPrime Minister's Visits Boost India's Perception as Investment Destination: Assocham
India flow tide has turned decisively, said Citi Research, a unit of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
"It's high, rising and could well have a long way to go," it said. Citi Research said retail inflows in mutual funds of $6 billion in six months looks sustainable; citing weak performance of other assets and very low equity ownership.
Year-to-date foreign debt inflows are ahead of equity flows for the first time, says Citi Research.
Foreign portfolio investors have invested $15 billion in Indian stocks and $23 billion in debt so far in 2014, according to Reuters data.
Citi Research says foreign investors are turning aggressive on India, betting more on cyclicals and less on defensives.
Domestic investors are raising exposure to staples, industrials and energy, it says, while maintaining Sensex target of 31,000 and Nifty target of 9,240 for December 2015.

Rajan Expects Final Norms on Small Banks by Month-EndPrime Minister's Visits Boost India's Perception as Investment Destination: Assocham
The Reserve Bank of India's proposed final guidelines on starting payment banks - meant to serve smaller businesses and lower income households - are likely by the end of the month, central bank governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday.
Mr Rajan, during a speech in Mumbai, said the final proposal for establishing payment banks was with the finance ministry for feedback, and said he expected to call for applications for potential payments banks by the end of the month.
In July, the central bank had issued draft guidelines on payment banks, which are meant to target the needs of under-banked segments such as small businesses, low income households, and farmers.

RBI against loan waiver scheme by state govtsRBI against loan waiver scheme by state governments

RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan (Photo: Reuters)
Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan on Thursday expressed reservation over the loan waiver scheme by various state governments and also suggested reasonable interest rate ceiling on loans from microfinance lenders.
"Repeated loan waivers by various state governments distorts credit pricing, thereby also disrupting the credit market," he said at a function organised by Nabard.
Both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments have declared loan waivers for the farmers hit by cyclone Phailin last year.
While the Telangana government has given the mandated 25 per cent of the written off loan amount to the banks, Andhra Pradesh has not done it so far.
Banks have over Rs 1.3 lakh crore exposure to the farm sector in these two states.
Rajan also underlined the need for reasonable interest rate ceiling for consumer protection.
"There should be a reasonable ceiling on interest rate on loans from microfinance lenders for consumer protection," he said.
Following the October 2010 crisis in the then undivided Andhra Pradesh that crippled the MFI sector, an RBI-appointed Malegam panel had suggested 26 per cent monthly cap on interest rates for the sector. This cap was notified by the central bank in April 2012.
The crisis began after the state government banned recovery by any coercive means, following a string of alleged suicides by micro-credit borrowers.

BSE Sensex off record highs; shares of oil firms plungePrint
Brokers say buying activities have gathered momentum on positive economic data as India's industrial production grew at 2.5 per cent in Sept. (Reuters)
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 13, 2014 10:15 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 4:58 pm
Snapping its three-day rally, the benchmark BSE Sensex today retreated from record highs to end over 68 points lower at 27,940.64 as the shares of state-owned oil companies fell as much as 6 per cent after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel.
The 30-share Sensex commenced on a strong note and soared to the day’s high of 28,098.74 on positive inflation and factory output data announced yesterday.
However, it succumbed to profit-booking and dipped below the 28,000-mark to hit the day’s low of 27,822.70 before recovering partially to settle at 27,940.64, down by 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent.
Yesterday, the benchmark index had ended at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90 and also hit intra-day high of 28,126.48 on sustained foreign funds inflows driven by economic reforms undertaken by the government recently.
The 50-scrip NSE Nifty ended 25.45 points, or 0.30 per cent, down at 8,357.85 after shuttling between 8,408.00 and 8,320.35.
The gauge yesterday concluded at record 8,383.30 after scaling a lifetime (intra-day) high of 8,415.05.
Meanwhile, country’s industrial production grew at 2.5 per cent in September and retail inflation eased to 5.52 per cent in October from 6.46 per cent in September, according to data released after market hours yesterday.
Besides profit-booking in blue-chip stocks, sentiments also dampened after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs 13,000 crore in revenue.
Stocks of state-run companies such as BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil Corp came under selling pressure and ended up to 6.11 per cent lower.
ONGC was among the biggest Sensex losers, plunging by 2.03 per cent, while RIL fell by 0.53 per cent.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 459.47 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Brokers said the market was in an over-bought position and participants adopted a cautious stance and preferred to lighten some positions by booking profits at record levels.
Selling was more pronounced in realty, PSU, metal, infrastructure, banking, power and auto stocks, which dragged down the key indices – Sensex and Nifty – from record highs.
Sesa Sterlite down by 2.50 per cent, Tata Power shed 2.47 per cent, GAIL fell 1.58 per cent, Axis Bank down 1.49 per cent, Hero MotoCorp by 1.38 per cent and HDFC by 1.14 per cent.

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Mumbai: Sesa Sterlite Ltd said on Thursday it would invest $782 million over a three-year period in southern Africa to tap the region's large undeveloped deposits of the metal.
The company would spend about $630 million to develop an open-pit zinc mine and associated infrastructure at Gamsberg, the company, part of the London-listed Vedanta Resources Plc said in a statement.
The balance will be used to convert the refinery at the Skorpion mine in Namibia to enable to it to refine zinc concentrates into high grade metal, it added.

Adani Enterprises Steps Up Australia Coal Plans Ahead of PM Modi s VisitBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Melbourne/New Delhi: Adani Enterprises is forging ahead with ambitious plans to build Australia's biggest coal mine in the next three years, defying a collapse in coal prices to 5-1/2 year lows as it seeks to supply power plants at home.
Australia's federal and Queensland state governments are eager to see the mine go ahead following the loss of more than 4,000 coal jobs, and Queensland has said Adani may make an announcement tied to the project when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Australia next week.
But analysts and project finance experts believe the Indian infrastructure and trading conglomerate may have underestimated the difficulties of raising funds for the $7 billion mine, rail and port project in the current market.
They see the 2017 target for opening a mine as "highly aggressive", with no debt funding lined up, no rise in coal prices in sight, and uncertainty over coal output in India and demand growth in India and north Asia.
"On a standalone basis, the economics just don't stack up - I'm talking about costs and return on capital. You'd need a price of about $100-$110 a tonne for it to stack up," said Daniel Morgan, global commodities analyst at UBS.
The benchmark Newcastle price for thermal coal is just $62.66 a tonne, down 27 per cent this year.
The Carmichael mine in the untapped Galilee Basin has been on hold since Adani bought it in 2010, faced with a drawn-out approvals and funding process.
Adani said last month it planned to start construction work early next year, aiming for first production from a 60-million-tonnes-a-year mine in 2017. At peak production it would boost Australia's thermal coal output by nearly 25 per cent.
Funding challenges
But to start work in the next six months, Adani would need to bring in a partner or pour in its own money, since it has yet to line up project debt at a time when a third of Australia's coal output is loss-making, analysts in India said.
Saddled with about $13 billion in net debt, it would need to raise around $1 billion through a share sale, a sale of a stake in the Abbot Point port or both.
"I think Adani will move slower with Carmichael than they say," said an analyst with a broker in Mumbai. "There are many risks."
Adani, which has appointed Morgan Stanley to advise on selling a stake in Abbot Point, said in an emailed statement that work was "progressing well to meet the project's 2017 first coal guidance."
Adani is also facing anti-coal campaigners who are fighting in courts to stop the mine and pressing banks not to lend for the port expansion, arguing that dredging and exports could harm the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef.
In a counter attack, Adani has launched advertisements on Australian television on the economic benefits of the project.
It is counting on lining up funding from South Korea, having named POSCO Engineering & Construction Co Ltd as the preferred contractor to build the 388 km rail line.
"We would note that our rail partner, POSCO E&C, has been advertising work opportunities and proposed work plans online and in trade publications for several months for early 2015," a spokesman for Adani said.
However both POSCO E&C and potential funding partner South Korea's Export-Import Bank said any agreements were at very early stages.
"It is hard to predict when a contract will be signed," said a POSCO E&C spokesman in Seoul.

India s Liquidity Expected to Go Back into Deficit: JP MorganPrime Minister's Visits Boost India's Perception as Investment Destination: Assocham
JP Morgan has said India's liquidity is expected to go into its normal state of deficit from current surplus.
The global financial services firm also said the government will cut spending to meet the fiscal deficit target.
"Government will also build back its cash balances", it said.
Deficit would preclude any large OMO sale, the bank added.
Future RBI liquidity management will be mainly through FX forward interventions, JP Morgan predicted.
Overall banking system liquidity deficit to average Rs 50,000 crore ($8.12 billion) through the rest of 2014-15. Overnight call will thus trade at close to repo rate, JP Morgan said.

Petrol  diesel duties up  will limit price cutsFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Consumers will be spared any impact of the hike in excise duty on auto fuels of R1.50 per litre announced by the government on Thursday with oil marketers planning to absorb the increase. “There will be no change in fuel prices as of now,” Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) chairman B Ashok said, pointing out that the profits from sales of petrol and diesel would cushion the impact of the increase in the levy.
However, consumers are also unlikely to benefit from fall in the prices of auto fuels that would have resulted from the falling international prices of crude oil; oil retailers have been adjusting prices of auto fuels every fortnight in line with global prices. Without committing a view on a price cut, Ashok said that with pricing now decontrolled, the company was “free to review prices as and when required”.
With the price of crude oil having dropped to below $80 a barrel, a four-year low, state-owned oil retailers BPCL, HPCL and IOC are in a position to take a hit on account of the higher excise duty.
Post the hike, the excise duty for petrol goes up from R1.20 a litre to R2.70 a litre and for diesel from R1.46 a litre to R2.96 a litre. The higher
duty will fetch the government an estimated R13,000-15,000 crore annually.
The hike, experts said, was not unexpected given indirect tax receipts, estimated to grow at over 20% in FY15, had grown by a mere 5.6% in April-October to R2.85 lakh crore. This amounted to just 46% of the the full-year target of R6.2 lakh crore. “The government is exploring all options to boost tax collections,” an industry watcher said. The value of the Indian crude basket dropped 17.22%, or $16.42 a barrel, to $78.92 per barrel on Wednesday from $95.34 a barrel on September 30.
The NDA government deregulated the price of diesel in mid-October, allowing the price of the fuel to be determined by market forces both at the refinery gate and at the pump, a move that came against the backdrop of falling crude oil prices. State-owned oil marketing companies cut the price of diesel by Rs 3per litre on October18. As part of its reforms in the oil and gas sector, the government approved an increase in the prices of domestic gas prices from November 1, linking them to a modified version of the Rangarajan committee formula, which uses a weighted average of domestic gas prices in Canada, Russia, the UK and the US, based on annual consumption.
In respect of branded petrol and diesel, the price has gone up from Rs 2.35 per litre to Rs 3.85 a litre and Rs 3.75 a litre to Rs 5.25 a litre. Krupa Venkatesh, senior director at Deloitte in India, believes the move will dampen the enthusiasm generated over the recent reduction in petrol and diesel prices, since oil marketing companies would inevitably pass on the burden to the consumer. “For industrial consumers, since there is no Cenvat credit on these goods, the increase will add to operating cost,” Venkatesh said.

Bid to plug 1.5 bn hole: Bleeding UK parent puts  India s third-largest BPO  Serco on saleAnalyst
(The review, which was led…)
MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Serco BPO, India's third-largest business process outsourcing company, is up for sale as its UK parent looks to raise funds to help mend a £1.5-billion hole in its balance sheet.
Earlier this week, London listed Serco cut its profit forecast for this year and the next, and took the huge writedown following a review that looked to tackle its failed contracts.
The review, which was led by McKinsey , concluded that the company should sell its noncore businesses, including the BPO business. Serco has also announced that it will raise £550 million through an equity rights issue.
"They will likely attract bids from other companies in the sector and private equity firms. There has been consolidation in the sector," a source with direct knowledge of the matter told ET.
Troubles at the parent had been going on for more than a year. Serco chief executive Chris Hyman quit in October after allegations the company may have committed fraud in one of its government contracts, which led to it being banned from bidding for new ones. The appointment of new CEO Rupert Soames, a grandson of wartime UK prime minister Winston Churchill, and the resulting turmoil also scuppered the BPO unit's acquisition plans in the past, the source said. The sale process is expected to be completed by the first half of 2015, the source with direct knowledge of the process said.
"Citigroup has been mandated for the sale of the business process unit and at least one Indian BPO company has expressed initial interest," a second source informed of the sale proceedings said. He declined to name the company. Private equity firm Carlyle is looking at an acquisition, Sky News reported in London.
Serco didn't immediately respond to a request seeking comment. "I am sure there will be a good number of buyers who would vie for that pie because Serco has pretty large operations in India," said Sandeep Ladda, partner and technology industry leader at PwC. Serco BPO has about 60,000 employees across the globe, its website said.
Serco's BPO division — called Serco Global Services — has about $1.2 billion in revenue and was created by consolidating the company's acquisitions, including Intelenet, the Listening Company in UK, Excelior in Australia and others in the Middle East. Some of the businesses in the Global Services unit may be sold separately and the government business will be retained by the parent, the second source said.
"We think this policy seems sensible as public sector service has always been the historical core of Serco and some of the forays into the private sector, such as with Intelenet, have had mixed outcomes," Robert Plant, an analyst with JPMorgan Cazenove , said in a note. According to Plant's estimates, the private company BPO business together with a few others also on the block has revenues of about 600 million pounds.
The BPO sector has been consolidating over the past two years. IBM sold its Daksh business to Concentrix last September, Convergys merged with Stream in January and Aegis sold it US business to Teleperformance in August.

Was Nehru fool as shown by right-wingers | View: We ignore his political astutenessNovember 14, 2014, 4:22 am IST Abheek Barman in Folk Theorem | India , Times View | ET
355
Jawaharlal Nehru would have been alive at 125 years old today, had he been some sort of superhero from a franchise like X-Men. He was India’s first prime minister, one of the great inspirations behind our democratic constitution, a charismatic and popular political leader. Nehru set up our first atomic research centre and our first statistics institutes, rocket launchers, as well as the IITs and IIMs.
He also pushed VKRV Rao, an eminent academic, to establish my alma mater, the Delhi School of Economics in 1949, two years after Independence and two years before our Constitution was finally debated through and written. Two years later, in 1951, the first IIT was set up in Kharagpur, Bengal. Nehru knew his chops: for him the economy came first, then technology and management. However, for the last 20 years, at least, if not more, he’s been characterized a fool by right wing critics who want laissez faire policies in India.
Over the last 25 years or so, many writers and commentators have pointed out that Nehru – our undisputed leader after Gandhi’s assassination in 1948 –could have guided India towards a kind of untrammeled capitalism as practiced by Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore in the early 1960s. This is an impossible assumption. Lee came to office in 1959, more than a decade after Nehru. This is plain dumb.
When Nehru came to office as the first prime minister of the first decolonised country after WW-II, he inherited a lot of baggage: global trade had shrunk because of the ravages of war and the damage that German and other submarines could do to ships carrying cargo or men. Autarky, or self-dependence was the order of the day.
The Germans and Italians were pioneers in this, as they promoted their own industries in favour of others, but in the end, war took the final toll on global trade. How could Nehru globalise newly-independent India, if nobody else was willing to trade or invest abroad?
One exception to this rule was a plan proposed and implemented by US’ George Marshall, to rebuild Europe, including a devastated Germany, with foreign aid. Japan, already nuked by America, got an abridged version of the Marshall Plan, implemented by Joseph Dodge, a banker under the supervision of a wary General Macarthur. India, devastated by war and famine, got nothing.
Then came Partition, on our western and eastern frontiers, with total devastation and the antagonism between person and person, caste and religion. This is the economic and social background into which Nehru stepped in, in 1947.
The trauma of Independence is long under-appreciated – the only stories told are of the massacres in western India-Pakistan. The underlying story is far more serious: according to economist Angus Maddison’s painstaking calculations, the average Indian’s income, (in 1990 dollars) was $550 in 1600, when the average Briton made $974, 43% more. By 1947, the year of de-colonisation, the difference had to swelled more than 10-times: the average Indian was making $618, the average Brit was making $6,361.
When it came to choosing a model for economic growth, Nehru had two: European capitalism or Soviet socialism. He chose to go by the numbers. During his time, he must have been impressed by the inflated Soviet figures. But decades later, even after adjusting for Soviet lies, Nehru cannot be faulted.
Maddison again gives us the clues: by the time the first Plan was being drawn up, western Europe was growing at 3.6%, the Soviet Union at 6.5%, even according to the deflated numbers. By 1958, the Soviets were charging along at 7.5% while Europe had fallen back to 2.4%. The year Nehru died, 1964, exactly 50 years to the year, Europe grew at 5.9%. The Soviets made 12.9%. To Nehru, a person who went by empiricism and not cant or grandmothers’ stories, it was a simple choice to make. He made India what it is today.

Saradha scam: Kunal Ghosh tries to end life  three days after he threatened to do soTMC MP Kunal Ghosh at CBI custody (Source: Express file photo by Subham Dutta)
Written by Madhuparna Das | Kolkata | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:21 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 8:16 pm
One of the prime accused in the multi crore Saradha chit fund scam, Kunal Ghosh – a former Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabbha Member tried to commit suicide at Presidency Corrctional Home in Kolkata late last night where he was lodged for past several months. Ghosh was rushed to SSKM hospital in the wee hours of Friday when prison guards reportedly noticed him lying in his cell in an “abnormal position“ with some sleeping pill strips lying by his side.
The jail doctor was summoned immeaitely and Kunal Ghosh was moved to the SSKM hospital at about 3 am wher ehe told the attendign doc tor that he had consumed about 30/40 sleeping pills. The doctors immedaitely washed his stomach and by late afternoon his condition was stated to be stable in the CCU.

Kunal Ghosh lived upto his threat just three days ago. On November 10, while being taken to City Civil court at Bankshal in Kolkata for production, he had shouted at the waiting media persons from the prison van saying that he would commit suicide within three days if the real culprits in the Saradha case were not arrested by the CBI. He alleged that the police had let free the actual culprits while he was rotting in the jail. Earlier, too, he had pointed fingers at several top Trinamool Congress leaders for their alleged complicity in the Saradha scam and demanded that they should be arrested and prosecuted.
However, as the day grew, the state government suspended in quick succession the Jail superintendent, the medical offier and the prion guard pending by the police to ascertain the facts and circumstances of how Kunal Ghosh attenpted suicide inside the prison cell. By all standardes it was surprising as to how could he lay his hands on such a large number of sleeping pills.

The Prisidency Correctional home, the Alipore Correctional home and other central jails in Kolkata are notorious for instances when various banned items have been “smugglinged in” for jail inmates – from lifers to the ordinary. Obviously, there existed well established channels within the prisons with active collusion with prison staff for maintaining such illegal supply chains to the prison inmates from continued…

Chhattisgarh sterilisation tragedy: Directors of drug company arrested; doctor blames govtVillagers protesting outside the state health minister's residence against underwent sterilization surgeries, in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh on Tuesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:20 am
In a late night action yesterday, the Chhattisgarh police arrested the directors of Mahavar Pharama Pvt Ltd, a manufacturer of antibiotic Ciprofloxacin consumed by the victims of the Bilaspur laparoscopic surgeries. The arrested directors are Ramesh Mahavar and his son Sumit Mahavar.
The police have said that the company did not manufacture the drugs here, bought from elsewhere and merely packaged it in the factory. The food and drug department noted that the company did not have proper equipment to manufacture drugs. A case of forgery under Section 420 of IPC has been registered against the duo.
However, these arrests raise serious questions over the health department and medicare in Chhattisgarh. The company had been operating in the state capital for over a decade. While the drug department failed to notice its allegedly illegal operations, the health ministry regularly purchased and used its medicines in bulk.
Following the ban on four drugs that were used during the surgeries, the Food and Drug Controller had raided and sealed the Raipur-based Mahavar Pharma Pvt Ltd yesterday. It is a small factory in a residential colony and does not even have a notice board indicating the company or its operations.
“We never sell to the government. We sell to drug traders, who supply it to various agencies. This antibiotic is sold at many places. We have never received any complaint,” the company said in a statement.
The dismissed Dr RK Gupta, who conducted 83 surgeries in just five hours, has also blamed the state government. “What is my fault? I am just a doctor. We were given the targets of surgeries. If we did not meet them, the administration pressurised us. The state government and Health Minister Amar Agarwal are responsible,” said Gupta, now in judicial custody.

Police may send Sunanda Pushkars viscera samples to UK labPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:05 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 1:13 pm
Delhi Police is considering sending Sunanda Pushkar’s viscera samples to forensic laboratories abroad to determine the nature and type of poison suspected to have caused her death.
Former Union minister Shashi Tharoor’s wife was found dead in a hotel room here in January this year. Police said they might send the viscera samples to a laboratory in the UK.
“We will send the samples depending on whether the AIIMS panel of doctors on the case are able to determine the type of poison used and how it caused Pushkar’s death,” an officer said.
“With this almost clear that Sunanda died of poisoning, the biggest question which remains in the case is that the kind of poison (used) and how it reached her body. If these question can be answered, the case could head to its logical end,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
As of now, the police have asked the AIIMS panel of doctors to redo their investigation and name the poison which caused Sunanda’s death but if it fails to do so, the samples will then be sent abroad.
The three mobile phones and a laptop of the deceased have already been sent to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for investigations to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets post her death.
Today too, police questioned some people who were related to the case but senior officials refused to divulge the identities of these people and what they told police.
The AIIMS panel of doctors had earlier said the police had not shared with it the photographs of scene of occurrence, statements and circumstantial evidences with them.
Police had not quizzed a single person in the last nine months nor did it try to inspect the ‘crime’ scene.
As the police try to reinvestigate the case from scratch, there are two possibilities in the case, first is that the police register a fresh FIR in the case and second it closes investigations stating that no foul play was found.
It was only after the AIIMS report that the police got suite number 345 of Leela Palace Hotel, where Pushkar was found dead, opened.
Police had also called upon the AIIMS doctors and experts from FSL to inspect the room during which fluid marks were found on Sunanda’s bed sheet, the carpet and a broken glass in the room. These articles have also been sent to forensic labs for examination.
The suite of the five star hotel, had remained sealed and was opened for the first time since the incident.
Police had also got information regarding Pushkar’s twin email accounts from Yahoo and Google with details of whom she was in touch during her last days.
A list of these people through their IP addresses was made by the police and they were quizzed about the conversations.
Their statements are now being tallied with each other and also with those which were recorded before the SDM during the initial investigation.
The medical board concluded that Pushkar’s vital organs like kidney, lungs and liver were continued…

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday arrived here in Australia on the second leg of his three-nation tour during which he will attend the annual G20 summit and hold bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott.
Modi reached Brisbane after attending the ASEAN-India summit and the East Asia Summit on November 12-13 in the Myanmarese capital Nay Pyi Taw.
The Prime Minister is on a 10-day visit of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji to attend key multilateral summits and undertake bilateral meetings.
Before his departure from India, Modi had said the importance of global cooperation against black money will be a “key issue” he will highlight at the G20 summit.
“A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money,” Modi had said in a pre-departure statement.
As India attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad, Modi is expected to renew the country’s commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
At the annual summit of the Group of 20 of the world’s biggest developed and emerging economies, Modi had said he intends to discuss how it can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure, and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The two-day summit will be held from November 15. G20 accounts for 85 per cent of the world’s economic output.
During his visit, Modi will also hold talks with Prime Minister Abbott in Canberra after the G20 summit.
Modi is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.
“While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential.
“A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India’s economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood,” he said referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney besides Canberra.

(Suspended Trinamool Congress…)
KOLKATA: Suspended Trinamool Congress MP and Saradha scam accused Kunal Ghosh today allegedly tried to commit suicide by consuming sleeping pills in the Presidency Correctional Home where he has been lodged since his arrest last year.
Ghosh, who had threatened to end his life if the CBI failed to take action against those involved in the scam, has been admitted to a hospital.
West Bengal Correctional Home Services minister H A Safwi said Ghosh had claimed to have consumed sleeping pills and was admitted to state-run SSKM Hospital, where doctors kept him under observation.
"The doctor was called and they found everything to be normal but still as a precautionary measure we did not take any chance and got him admitted to the SSKM Hospital," the minister told PTI here.
SSKM Director Pradip Mitra said Ghosh is out of danger. A top jail department official said as he had threatened to commit suicide an extra watch was kept on him for the past two days.
"Before he went to sleep we searched him thoroughly. But no sedative or sleeping pill was found in his possession.
"But at around 2.30 AM he started complaining of breathlessness and claimed he had taken sleeping pills. Jail doctors called on him, examined him thoroughly but did not find anything abnormal. Still we did not take any chance," the official told PTI.
Ghosh had threatened to commit suicide when he was produced before a city court on November 10 if CBI did not take "proper action" against those involved within three days.
"Investigation is being influenced. It is not acceptable that I will rot in jail while those involved will roam freely. I am giving three days' time, if action is not taken I will commit suicide," he had told Metropolitan Magistrate Arvind Mishra at Bankshall Court here.
"I pray to you to pass an order that during these three days, none of my relatives or my lawyer be allowed to meet me or else I may get influenced and dissuaded," Ghosh, who had during earlier court hearings accused some top TMC leaders of having benefited from the scam, told the judge that day.

SFIO stumbles upon bank scam in Saradha scam probeSFIO stumbles upon Indian Bank scam in Saradha Group fraud probe

Investigations carried out by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) into the Saradha group fraud have thrown up a major bank scam involving public sector Indian Bank as the leader of a consortium that extended loans in excess of Rs 171 crore to a shell company. Global Automobiles Ltd (GAL), a firm purportedly engaged in the manufacture of motorcycles and scooters, was acquired by the Saradha group .
"It appears that the bank officials, including Malay Mukherjee, the then GM of Indian Bank, were in connivance with GAL and its erstwhile directors, including Santanu Ghosh, Samiran Das and Indrajit Chandra, and are prima facie liable for punishment under Section 420 read with Section 120B of the IPC," the SFIO report states. The two sections deal with cheating and criminal conspiracy.
State Bank of India (SBI) also figures among the consortium of lenders. The SFIO report further recommends that "a reference may be made to the CBI and the Reserve Bank of India to investigate the grant of loans to GAL against non-existent/highly inflated value of assets and the role of bank officials thereof". The report has also recommended referring the matter to the Enforcement Directorate .
The SFIO team had calculated the net worth of GAL at a paltry Rs 0.41 crore, based on the figures provided in its balance sheet in 2010. However, despite the very low net worth, the Saradha group signed an agreement to purchase 100 per cent equity shares of GAL from Ghosh for Rs 20 crore on October 30, 2010.
Investigations have revealed that GAL had shown stocks to the tune of Rs 125.49 crore to get the loan but the actual value of these stocks, which included 80-odd motorcycles and some spare parts such as mudguards, could at most be valued at Rs 13.31 crore.
Various inspection teams from the banks in question had recorded on May 12, 2011, that although the company was supposed to be engaged in the manufacture of motorcycles and scooters "during the course of our inspection, no production activity was taking place".
A second inspection report dated October 29, 2011, reiterated the observation.
"However, the minutes of a meeting of consortium lenders held on August 12, 2011, reveal that Indian Bank GM Malay Mukherjee, who also headed the Kolkata zonal office, had undertaken a sudden visit to the factory premises of GAL on August 5, 2011, and observed that 'manufacturing activities were going on and there were about 300 completed bikes'," the SFIO report points out.
Interestingly, Sudipta admitted to the SFIO team that the accounts of GAL were falsely prepared by Ghosh and Sudeshna Ghosh with their statutory auditors and this stock was shown in the balance sheet to take working capital loans from banks.
However, no physical purchase was made by the two and the same was written off later through profit and loss accounts.
Sudipta also disclosed that he had already brought this fact to the notice of Excise Department officials when they came for verification.
While being interrogated, he further stated that he had tried to get the GAL stocks physically verified but Ghosh did not allow it.
Another Saradha group official told the SFIO team that when he undertook a physical verification of the stocks at a later date the inventory with GAL could be valued at a mere Rs 1 crore.
A NEW SCAM
>> Investigations have revealed that the shell firm, Global Automobiles Limited (GAL), had shown stocks to the tune of Rs 125.49 crore to get over Rs 171 crore in loan from a consortium of banks
>> The SFIO concluded following a probe that the stocks, which included 80-odd motorcycles and some spare parts such as mudguards, could at most be valued at Rs 13.31 crore.
>> The consortium includes public sector Indian Bank and SBI
>> The loan was extended despite the fact that two reports prepared by the banks' inspection teams concluded that there was 'no production underway at the firm'

PM Narendra Modi s Australia trip to boost tradeAustralia
(Modi, who is visiting Australia…)
NEW DELHI: In the first trip to Australia by an Indian Prime Minister in 28 years, Narendra Modi will engage with his counterpart Tony Abbott to boost trade, investment, energy and security partnership, and look for avenues to remove red tape that investors face in the two countries.
Following Modi-Abbott talks on November 17-18 in Canberra and Melbourne, India and Australia will ink five MoUs in the areas of social security, transfer of sentenced prisoners, counter-narcotics, culture and tourism, senior Australian government officials told ET.
"The relationship has come of age in the past three decades as we aim to realise full potential in the bilateral ties in wide-ranging areas from trade to security. We want to make this visit as fruitful as possible," said an Australian government official, requesting anonymity.
Modi, who is visiting Australia within three months of Abbott's visit to India as PM, will arrive in Brisbane on November 15 and cover Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne during his four-day trip, signalling an interest in expanding bilateral ties.
The social security agreement expected to be signed by the two countries will not only address hurdles faced by Indian professionals in Australia and vice versa but also help reduce costs of Australian businesses in India, officials said.
The agreements on transfer of sentenced persons and counter-narcotics will enable combating transnational crimes. India has emerged as a trans-shipment point for narcotics from Af-Pak-Iran regions to Australia, officials said. The MoU on culture entails festival of India in Australia next year as Indian culture and movies have emerged as big hits in the country down under.

PM Narendra Modi keen on Malaysian model of performance assessmentPM Narendra Modi keen on Malaysian model of performance assessment

(The prime minister said…)
NAIR NAY PYI TAW: As part of his endeavour to constantly evaluate the performance of his government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking a cue from the Malaysian model, calling it an "excellent example".
During his meeting with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak yesterday, Modi said he was greatly impressed by the performance assessment mechanism that is in place in the southeast Asian country.
Modi told Razak that he had had discussions on this subject with some Malaysian officials who had worked on it, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin told reporters here.
The prime minister said that this is an excellent example of how monitoring of performance is done. But he said Malaysia is more than only governance reform.
While this was governance reform, Modi also felt that Malaysia has been open for economic reforms and he felt that both Malaysia and India could work together in areas like housing.
Modi said public housing was a major focus of the new Indian government which plans to go for large scale public housing by 2022. And he felt that Malaysian companies who had expertise in these would be welcome specifically in public housing projects.
To keep the government departments on their toes and deliver on the BJP's poll promise to bring "Achchhe Din" (good days), the prime minister is understood to be keen on revamping the Performance Management and Evaluation System (PMES), currently run by a division at the Union government's Cabinet Secretariat.
Razak set up the Performance Management and Delivery Unit, commonly known as PEMANDU, in his office in September 2009, just a few months after taking over.
PEMANDU oversees implementation, assesses progress, facilitates and supports delivery and drives progress of the Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme launched by Razak, who heads the unit as its chairman.

NAY PYI TAW: Ahead of next month's annual Indo-Russia summit , Prime Minister Narendra Modi today met Russian Premier Dmitry Medvedev who said India is a "close and valued" partner for his country.
The meeting with the Russian leader was the first diplomatic engagement of Modi on the third day of his 10-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji on the sidelines of the two back-to-back India-ASEAN and East Asia summits here.
"India is a close and valued partner for us," Medvedev told Modi while discussing the extent of Indo-Russian relations during their meeting at the Myanmar International Conference Centre.
In response Modi said he was confident that the ties between the two countries will be strengthened.
Modi also recalled his visit to Russia in 2001. During their conversation, Modi also spoke on the need for the federal units - states and regions of the two countries to cooperate more, a view which Medvedev endorsed.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is travelling to New Delhi next month for the 15th annual India-Russia summit.
Modi during his first meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brazil in July favoured broadening India's strategic partnership with Russia in nuclear, defence and energy sectors.
He had also invited Putin to visit Kudankulam atomic power project during his trip for the annual summit.
Modi had also fondly recalled his visit to Russia's Astrakhan region in his early days as chief minister of Gujarat which has ties with that region.
Putin said Russia places its relations with India high enough in the strategic framework.

Right time to cut rates Sept IIP recovers to 2.5%Right time to cut interest rates? September IIP recovers to 2.5%; October CPI dips to 5.52%

(A 2.55% decline in car sales…)
NEW DELHI: Industrial production growth picked up marginally in September to a three-month high and consumer inflation fell to record low, yet few would be willing to risk a wager on Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan cutting interest rates next month to stimulate the economy despite voices calling on him to do just that.
Industrial growth recovered to a better-than-expected 2.5% in September from less than half-a-per cent in August, data released by the statistics office on Wednesday showed, lifted by the high growth in usually volatile capital goods. The separately released consumer price index (CPI) showed retail inflation slowed further to 5.52% in October, another low on the gauge that was launched in 2011, because of softer food and fuel prices.
Inflation is likely to head even lower with international crude prices falling further and the winter vegetable crop likely to push prices down, but growth indicators suggest consumer demand is still weak and the festival season has not provided any cheer.
Most experts think it's the right time to cut rates but expect Rajan to keep them unchanged well into 2015 even at the risk of friction with the new government that would look to an easier monetary policy stance to help strengthen the prospects of recovery after two years of growth below 5%. "Declining retail inflation is a very good sign. Though it is the right time for RBI to cut rates, it does not seem that it will, and will rather wait for some more time," said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings.
RBI has set a target of bringing inflation down to 8% by January 2015 and 6% by January 2016 and has talked of breaking the back of inflation once and for all, rather than relenting too early in the war on prices. Some experts only expect Rajan to move on this front after the budget in February when a clearer picture emerges of the government's finances.
 
"In CPI, the 8% target by January 2015 is distinctly achievable and may touch 7% by March 2015," said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor, State Bank of India. "Inflationary expectations will take a while to come down, so the central bank will not take the risk of cutting rates but may go for a bigger cut when it feels the trend is sustainable." Rajan has left the key repo rate unchanged at 8% since January, when he had raised it by 25 basis points. The next monetary policy announcement will be on December 2.
Markets are piling on the pressure for a rate cut with bond yields heading lower while sluggish credit offtake has forced some banks to cut deposit rates. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has favoured a cut in interest rates in the face of moderating inflation. At the World Economic Forum's India Economic Summit in Delhi last week, a number of industrialists called for lower interest rates. The Confederation of Indian Industry said on Wednesday that it hoped the decline in inflation "would propel RBI to reduce policy rates in its forthcoming monetary policy especially as consumer demand continues to be tepid," adding that growth is showing early signs of revival.
Available evidence shows the economy possibly slowed in September from ninequarter high GDP growth of 5.7% in the April-June quarter. Industrial growth has been low in the second quarter of FY15 — 0.41% in July, 0.48% in August and 2.5% in September. Excise collections are down 1.2% in April-October from the year earlier, suggesting very weak manufacturing. Overall, indirect tax collections are up only 5.6% in this period.
Production of consumer durables contracted 11.3% in September, suggesting weak demand in the face of high interest rates and a lower rise in income. A 2.55% decline in car sales in October suggests the marginal recovery in September industrial production may not be sustained. India Ratings has already trimmed its FY15 growth forecast to 5.6% from 5.7%, citing weaker industrial growth.
"GDP growth is estimated to decline to 5.0% in Q2 from 5.7% in Q1, on the back of factors such as an unfavourable kharif harvest, sluggish manufacturing performance, slowdown in export growth and moderation in the pace of expansion of central government spending," said Aditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA. Manufacturing activity grew by 2.5% during the month, led mainly by the capital goods sector, which posted 11.6% growth after two straight months of contraction. Output in only seven out of 22 sub-sectors contracted in September.
"Capital goods uptick was partly due to the negative base effect and partly on account of projects cleared by the government," said Sabnavis of CARE Ratings. Even declining inflation and the festive season, which usually sees people loosening their wallets, could not revive consumer spending, as evidenced by consumer durables output dropping 11.3%.
Mining grew 0.7% in September and is expected to get better in the coming months based on the government's action plan to auction the 214 cancelled coal blocks and an ordinance to allow commercial mining. This, in turn, will also have a positive effect on manufacturing and electricity. Electricity output rose 3.9% during the month. "The infrastructure sector seems to be rebounding," said Ghosh of SBI. "The capital cycle is expected to revive, after which consumer demand will improve with a lag."
Retail food inflation slowed to 5.59% in October from 7.67% in September while vegetables saw a 1.45% deflation. The fuel price inflation eased further to 3.29%. Another cut in fuel prices is expected, the seventh for petrol since June and the third for diesel since its decontrol on October 18. Wholesale inflation, which touched a five-year-low of 2.38% in September, may slow further in October.

(Loans expanded 4.6% year…)
MUMBAI: The latest data on bank credit show that demand for loans continues to remain sluggish. If this trend continues, banks will have no option but to lower their lending rates even before the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) moves to cut the repo rate.
Loans expanded 4.6% year to date to Rs 62.2 lakh crore as of October 31. At the same time, banks are seeing their deposits grow at a faster pace than credit, putting pressure on their cost of funds. Total deposits in the banking system rose 7.4% year to date to Rs 82.8 lakh crore as of October 31.
While the change in government in May brought a sense of optimism on the economy front, banks are yet to see any pick-up in demand for funds from corporates. Banks, on their part, are not pushing for loans aggressively either, because of asset quality concerns.
Asset quality deterioration of Indian public sector banks may have bottomed out, according to ratings firm Moody's. However, the recovery in corporate credit quality is expected to be a slow multi-year process and, meanwhile, the lagging recognition of credit costs associated with nonperforming loans will continue to act as a drag on the banks' credit quality, it said.
Many banks, including the country's largest, State Bank of India , have cut deposit rates in certain baskets. But only one, Axis Bank , has cut lending rates in the recent past. Bankers said they are awaiting appropriate policy signals from the central bank to cut lending rates. Corporates expect RBI to cut the repo rate - the key policy rate - as retail inflation has slipped below 6% levels, within the central bank's comfort zone.
Economists, however, expect the central bank to wait till low inflation numbers are sustained over a longer period of time. "We agree that rate cuts will provide a relief for over-leveraged firms and boost credit, but it is unlikely to revive investment," said a report by HSBC released on Wednesday. "Our research shows that the recent investment slowdown in India is mainly due to increased policy uncertainty, which was partly caused by policy indecision and high inflation volatility."

Industry hopeful of rate cut as economy shows recovery signs
Nov 12, 2014, 10.04PM IST
( CII hoped it would propel…)
NEW DELHI: Buoyed by the uptick in industrial output and easing inflation, India Inc today said that improving economic data makes strong case for a cut in interest rates.
Industry body CII said the upturn in industrial production underpins the perception that the growth momentum is positive for industry and the economy is showing early signs of revival based on the feel good factor and positive investor sentiment.
"We hope that going forward, the tentative signs of revival would transform into a firm recovery as overall business confidence is looking up and there is optimism about the change in governance conditions pertaining to the ease of doing business," CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
Showing signs of recovery, industrial production growth perked up to a three-month high of 2.5 per cent in September mainly due better mining and manufacturing output and larger offtake of capital goods.
Besides, driven by softening prices of food items, the retail inflation in October declined further to 5.52 per cent, the lowest since the government started computing the new series of data in January 2012.
Welcoming the drop in retail inflation, CII hoped it would propel the Reserve Bank to reduce policy rates in its forthcoming monetary policy especially as consumer demand continues to be tepid.
According to the IIP data, manufacturing -- which constitutes over 75 per cent of the index -- grew by 2.5 per cent in September, compared to 1.4 per cent growth in output a year ago. For April-September, the sector grew at 2 per cent, compared to 0.2 per cent growth in the year-ago period.
"It is heartening to see the positive growth of manufacturing in September which seems to be broad based too. We are hopeful that manufacturing growth will pick up in the coming months as a result of steps taken by the Government recently and also due to improved business sentiments," Ficci President-elect Jyotsna Suri said.
Pressing for a rate cut, Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said: "There exists a certain need at this juncture to convince the monetary authority to reduce the policy rates, besides, these are the necessary conditions for ensuring the success of Make in India programme as well".
The Reserve Bank has lately started targeting retail inflation while deciding on its bi-monthly monetary policy. RBI has been targeting a retail inflation of 8 per cent by March 2015 and 6 per cent by March 2016.
RBI's next monetary policy is due on December 2, 2014.

He denied there were back channel talks with the BJP to join the government.
"We demanded division of votes and since it was not accepted, we staged a walkout in the end," he said.
Shinde also said the sequence of items listed on the day's agenda was changed at the last minute to create an uproar in the house so that the trust vote could be "rushed through".
"The item of announcement of the leader of opposition was taken after the vote of confidence, though it was listed before the trust vote," he said.

Android One faces stiff competition from Xiaomi & MotoAndroid One faces stiff competition from Xiaomi & Motorola; poses tough challenge for Google
By Danish Khan , ET Bureau | 13 Nov, 2014, 06.15AM IST
The strategy was flawed, especially for a device targeted at a large segment of the population unlikely to have access to the internet.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Early trends suggest that Indian consumers have given a lukewarm reception to Google's much-touted Android One devices amid intense competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Motorola, posing a tough challenge for the US company, which has made the standard the centrepiece of its emerging-market strategy for smartphones.
Import data for October showed Google's Android One partners — Micromax, Karbonn and Spice — together imported just over 2 lakh devices in the first full month of sales. This was less than the nearly 2.3 lakh handsets imported for the 15 days of September, data from market research firm Cybex Exim Solutions, available exclusively with ET, showed. The devices were launched in mid-September.
IDC analyst Karan Thakkar and Counterpoint Research Analyst Tarun Pathak said initial sales have been hurt by intense competition as well as the fact that Android One devices were initially only available online, which still has limited penetration in India. The strategy was flawed, especially for a device targeted at a large segment of the population unlikely to have access to the internet.
"For the month of October, roughly 8 million smartphones were shipped into the country, of which Android One would be just about 2.5%," said an industry tracker, who did not want to be quoted.
A Google spokesperson, however, said the devices were seeing "very strong sales and consumer interest", particularly in tier II and tier III cities. IDC's Thakkar, too, expects Android One sales to pick up in November and December. A person familiar with the matter said though Micromax's sales of its Android One device exceeded that of rivals, it managed to sell only about 1.2 lakh units till October end, as against a total of 2.50 lakh units imported. "They had anticipated huge demand for the device, and therefore had ordered a large stock." Micromax didn't respond to requests for comment.
Pardeep Jain, managing director of Karbonn Mobiles , said its Android One Sparkle V smartphone had performed below the company's expectations, adding that sales were also marred as supplies were available for only 15 days in October. "Traction has started coming now and demand is improving," he said. Prashant Bindal, chief executive officer of Spice Mobility, said sales were hit by supply issues. "We had faced an outof-stock situation during the month since there was no inventory coming from China."
A person familiar with the matter said that Karbonn and Spice, unsure about the product's prospects, had shipped low quantities, which were eventually sold out once they started offline sales in addition to online. "The factories in China couldn't suddenly cater to their requirements for additional stocks, thus creating a supply gap."
The two companies started selling their devices offline to push sales earlier in October, after their initial strategy of an exclusive online launch failed to gather momentum. The drawback with selling through retail stores is that it increases the cost of handsets.
Micromax imported 1.32 lakh units of its Canvas A1 device in October compared with 1.19 lakh in September. Karbonn brought in just 34,390 units of its Sparkle V handset in October, almost half the 67,440 units imported in September. Spice brought 34,390 units in October, compared with 43,100 units in September, according to Cybex Exim.
Android One devices are facing stiff competition from the likes of China's Xiaomi and Motorola - both of which are also selling only online -- as some of these models offer the same or better specifications at lower or similar price points. "Vendors such as Motorola, Gionee and Lava are providing stiff competition," said Pathak of Counterpoint Research. Experts added that these phones need to offer more features at lower price points, and that their unique qualities need to be more effectively communicated.
"The USP of Android One such as software updates and other Google services of the device were not publicised. That was another reason for the lukewarm response toward Android One devices," Pathak said, referring to the close integration of Maps, Google Now and other features.
Moreover, the inability of these devices to take pictures without adding an external card may have also hurt sales.
Success in India - among the world's fastest-growing and most price-sensitive markets -- is critical for Google, which plans to take the low-cost Android One devices to markets such as Indonesia , the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka shortly. The US giant has tied up with new partners including Acer, Asus, HTC, Lenovo and Panasonic apart from India's Lava and Intex and chipmaker Qualcomm for the next set of handsets.

PM Modi banks on civil servants to fix key issuesFrank Jack Daniel and Rupam Jain Nair        Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 19:51 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Anil Swarup is just the kind of man Prime Minister Narendra Modi is relying on to fix India - a high-flying civil servant with a taste for complex policy and swift decisions.
Modi has drawn trusted bureaucrats into a tight embrace. Interviews with two dozen sources, including close aides, reveal that key decisions are now thrashed out between his office and civil servants, often at the expense of ministerial authority.
Swarup sees a golden era for those willing to rise to the challenge. In his case that means ending coal shortages that keep much of India in the dark, a top priority for Modi.
In a series of meetings with civil servants, often without the ministers they nominally report to, Modi has urged bold decisions and promised all the help they need.
"He has given a virtual carte blanche. Go and do it," Swarup told Reuters. However, he did not say the responsibility handed to him had come at the expense of ministers.
Such moves, along with disciplinary innovations such as finger scanners to track attendance, have helped break a logjam in decision-making that undermined the last government, spawned corruption scandals and soured the investment climate.
Modi's style also lessens dissent from potential rivals, helping him capture power to a degree not seen since Indira Gandhi ruled India with an iron fist 30 years ago.
Critics call it authoritarian and say he is weakening the country's collegiate Cabinet system. Some in government caution that in a country as complex as India, over-centralization can lead to new bottlenecks.
The government denies there is interference in the ministries, saying Modi's role is to facilitate policy.
"There is one misconception - the PMO (Prime Minister's Office) does not issue direction to the ministries," Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said.
MIDNIGHT MASSACRES
The shakeup started as soon as Modi took office six months ago, when he declared "all important policy issues" part of his portfolio. He quickly took control of bureaucratic appointments, cutting ministers out of the loop.
Since September, there have been three major reshuffles in the civil service, all closely overseen by Modi and his core team. Top officials have woken to find themselves thrust into the limelight, or shunted into administrative backwaters.
A Cabinet expansion on Sunday and a new finance ministry team advised by leading economist Arvind Subramanian should boost the capacity and intellectual heft of the government.
Yet not everyone is happy with the new order.
Those on the wrong side of reshuffles dub them "midnight massacres" that have slowed policies. Survivors murmur they are scared to take decisions that might anger Modi.
A programme to sell stakes in state-owned companies worth $9.5 billion has barely started, in part because Modi purged the top team of bureaucrats at the finance ministry before bringing in Subramanian.
Tales of cabinet members' clipped wings abound.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh has been weakened, ministry officials say, since rumours swirled that his son was influence peddling. Modi publicly denied those rumours and backed Singh, but has kept him on the back foot since.
When heavy shelling broke out between home ministry border troops and Pakistani Rangers in October, Singh was hardly consulted.
"The PMO is directly communicating with officers. Rajnath is a mere decorative figure in the ministry," said one senior home ministry official. Singh ranks second in the government, but has been silent at cabinet meetings, another official said.
GUJARAT MODEL
Modi's preference to work with the bureaucracy and junior ministers was honed during 12 years as chief minister of Gujarat. Now he wants to replicate that model, sources said.
"He is aware that it cannot be done immediately but you have to drive the policy," said Saurabh Patel, Gujarat's oil minister who worked closely with Modi.
As in Gujarat, Modi controls communication, limits media access and brands major policies as his own. His control of the Bharatiya Janata Party is also extensive, with the old guard sidelined and his closest aide installed as party president.
Many Indians voted for firm leadership, after the scandal-tainted administration of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.
"He feels that we have been so weakened that he has to be in control," said Manjeet Kripalani, founder of the Gateway House think-tank.
But concerns remain that centralization and pressure to move quickly have led to ill-advised decisions, including one likely to cross Swarup's desk.
Under pressure to reduce India's reliance on imports, coal minister Piyush Goyal ordered the opening of the Amrapali mine in Jharkhand - the first major pit to open in five years.
There was only one problem: the mine is 85 km (53 miles) from the nearest railway, at the end of a rutted track, making it expensive to transport the coal. As a result, there are few customers, officials told Reuters.
"The pressure is to just produce without having facilities to evacuate coal," said an official at Coal India, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Petrol  diesel excise duty hiked by 1.50/litreComments
The government on Thursday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs. 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs. 13,000 crore in revenue, a move that may translate into similar increase in retail rates.
The fall in international oil prices had resulted in six consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and two in diesel in the last one month and there was possibility of another round of cuts this weekend.
But the possible reduction has now been negated as the the government decided to raise excise duty to shore up its revenue.
Excise duty on normal or unbranded petrol was hiked from Rs. 1.20 per litre to Rs. 2.70 per litre and unbranded diesel from Rs. 1.46 a litre to Rs. 2.96, a government notification said.
The same on branded petrol was raised from Rs. 2.35 a litre to Rs. 3.85 and on branded diesel from Rs. 3.75 to Rs. 5.25 per litre. While the excise duty hike will result in an immediate increase in both petrol and diesel prices, the expected reduction would keep the retail rates at almost the same levels.
There is also a possibility of state-owned oil firms preponing the planned review of fuel prices due on Saturday to make the whole exercise price neutral for consumers.
Before the duty hike, petrol cost Rs. 64.25 a litre in Delhi and diesel Rs. 53.35 a litre. While the fall in global rates and the resultant cuts in retail prices had led to loss of revenue to the exchquer, particularly, for state governments, there wasnt any loss to the Central government on account of reduction in petrol and diesel prices as excise duty on the two fuel is fixed and not ad valorem.
Unbranded petrol currently attracts a basic excise duty of Rs. 1.20 per litre, a special additional excise duty of Rs. 6 a litre and a road cess of Rs. 2 per litre.
Unbranded diesel attracts a basis excise duty of Rs. 1.46 a litre and road cess of Rs. 2 per litre.
The total excise duty on unbranded petrol will rise from Rs. 9.20 to Rs. 10.70 per litre and than on unbranded diesel from Rs. 3.46 to Rs. 4.96 per litre.
Branded petrol currently attracts an excise duty of Rs. 10.35 per litre which would go up to Rs. 11.85 per litre and that on branded diesel from Rs. 5.75 to Rs. 7.25 per litre.

Ganganagar SP poses with Union Minister Nihal Chand  but fails to deliver him court summonsPrint
Written by Sweta Dutta | Jaipur | Posted: November 13, 2014 2:57 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 3:06 pm
The Ganganagar Police could not find Union Minister Nihal Chand Meghwal to deliver a court summons despite Meghwal being a frequent visitor to his home constituency. His new address in New Delhi, 17 Teen Murti Marg, is known to all but the police in sleepy Ganganagar that boasts of a central minister after ages.
Even as Meghwal put an end to the controversy of him going “missing” and sent his lawyer to represent him in a court hearing on Wednesday, the Ganganagar Police chose not to respond to the court’s directions to ensure that a summons was delivered to him. Meghwal’s lawyer AK Jain said that he had taken suo moto cognizance of the court hearing through media reports and appeared on behalf of Meghwal.
It must be noted that the Ganganagar SP Hari Prasad Sharma, who had told a lower court in Jaipur that a summons could not be served on Meghwal at his Rai Singh Nagar residence because he had shifted to New Delhi and the new address was unknown to the police, participated in the Run for Unity campaign along with Meghwal on October 31 in Ganganagar and also posed for photo-ops.
Meghwal’s presence in his home constituency has made headlines and also called for special arrangements and security. On October 20, Meghwal adopted Mirzewala village as part of the Saansad Adarsh Gram project of the center. On November 7 and 8 he participated in several inaugurations and functions related to the upcoming local body polls. At one function he announced Rs. 2 crore for a drinking water project while at another he announced Rs. 22 lakh for development of Rai Singh Nagar.
While Sharma has maintained that it is the SHO’s job to deliver the summons, SHO Rai Singh Nagar Narayan Daan said that “hundreds of summons come every day and it is not possible to keep track of each one of them.”
Director General of Police Omendra Bhardwaj told the Indian Express, “It is possible that the summons might be buried in the bureaucratic process. That is only a possibility. It is true that the SHO receives the summons and has to deliver it.”
The controversy was put to an end after Meghwal’s representative appeared in court on Wednesday. The next hearing is slated for December 6.
Case status
Meghwal and six others out of the total 17 accused in the case appeared through their lawyers before a lower court on Wednesday citing suo moto cognizance of the court hearing through media reports. The Vaishali Nagar police station cited “work pressure” for not being able to look for the prime accused Om Prakash Godara, the alleged victim’s husband. Former MLA Yogeshwar Garg also could not be found at the given rented accommodation while his son Prakash Punj Garg, also named in the case, appeared through a lawyer. Since all the accused or their representatives could not appear for the hearing on Wednesday, the court was adjourned for next hearing on December 6.

Asian markets dips  oil hovers near lowsAsian markets dips while Japan bucks trend, oil hovers near lows

(Asian stocks dipped in early…)
TOKYO: Asian stocks dipped in early trade on Friday following fresh signs of slowing Chinese growth, while crude oil hovered near a four-year low in an oversupplied market.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.25 per cent.
The index has been confined to a narrow range this week as the US economy outperforms the euro zone and China.
China's economy lost further momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low.
"As the Federal Reserve policy shifts towards monetary tightening, the kind of risk aversion stemming from emerging markets we saw at the start of the year may take place again," said Junichi Ishikawa, a market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.
"The European Central Bank will play a key role in preventing such risk aversion. We may see instability continue in emerging markets until they are convinced that easing from the ECB and Bank of Japan can provide global support."
Tokyo shares outperformed their Asian peers, continuing to draw support from expectations that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call an election in December and possibly delay a sales tax hike. The Nikkei was up 0.1 per cent, after hitting a fresh seven-year high.
The dollar hit a seven-year high of 116.20 yen on swirling Japanese election speculation.
US retail sales numbers due later in the day are awaited for further impetus.
  The focus is on how the US Treasury market would react to the data after slightly softer than expected US jobless claims numbers nudged bond yields lower on Thursday and momentarily capped the greenback.
The euro fetched $1.2465, continuing to inch away from a two-year low of $1.2358 struck last Friday.
US crude oil was up 13 cents at $74.34 a barrel, although the bounce paled in comparison to the 3.9 per cent drop the commodity suffered on Thursday, when it fell to a four-year low of $74.07.
Oil has been hit this week by factors including a stockpile surge at a delivery point for US crude and reluctance by Saudi Arabia to cut output when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27.
Crude prices have slumped more than 30 per cent since June.

Police may send Sunanda Pushkars viscera samples to UKlabPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:05 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 1:13 pm
Delhi Police is considering sending Sunanda Pushkar’s viscera samples to forensic laboratories abroad to determine the nature and type of poison suspected to have caused her death.
Former Union minister Shashi Tharoor’s wife was found dead in a hotel room here in January this year. Police said they might send the viscera samples to a laboratory in the UK.
“We will send the samples depending on whether the AIIMS panel of doctors on the case are able to determine the type of poison used and how it caused Pushkar’s death,” an officer said.
“With this almost clear that Sunanda died of poisoning, the biggest question which remains in the case is that the kind of poison (used) and how it reached her body. If these question can be answered, the case could head to its logical end,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
As of now, the police have asked the AIIMS panel of doctors to redo their investigation and name the poison which caused Sunanda’s death but if it fails to do so, the samples will then be sent abroad.
The three mobile phones and a laptop of the deceased have already been sent to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for investigations to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets post her death.
Today too, police questioned some people who were related to the case but senior officials refused to divulge the identities of these people and what they told police.
The AIIMS panel of doctors had earlier said the police had not shared with it the photographs of scene of occurrence, statements and circumstantial evidences with them.
Police had not quizzed a single person in the last nine months nor did it try to inspect the ‘crime’ scene.
As the police try to reinvestigate the case from scratch, there are two possibilities in the case, first is that the police register a fresh FIR in the case and second it closes investigations stating that no foul play was found.
It was only after the AIIMS report that the police got suite number 345 of Leela Palace Hotel, where Pushkar was found dead, opened.
Police had also called upon the AIIMS doctors and experts from FSL to inspect the room during which fluid marks were found on Sunanda’s bed sheet, the carpet and a broken glass in the room. These articles have also been sent to forensic labs for examination.
The suite of the five star hotel, had remained sealed and was opened for the first time since the incident.
Police had also got information regarding Pushkar’s twin email accounts from Yahoo and Google with details of whom she was in touch during her last days.
A list of these people through their IP addresses was made by the police and they were quizzed about the conversations.
Their statements are now being tallied with each other and also with those which were recorded before the SDM during the initial investigation.
The medical board concluded that Pushkar’s vital organs like kidney, lungs and liver were continued…

Narendra Modi arrives in Australia for G20 summit; first Indian PM in 28 years to visitOzPrint

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday arrived here in Australia on the second leg of his three-nation tour during which he will attend the annual G20 summit and hold bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott.
Modi reached Brisbane after attending the ASEAN-India summit and the East Asia Summit on November 12-13 in the Myanmarese capital Nay Pyi Taw.
The Prime Minister is on a 10-day visit of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji to attend key multilateral summits and undertake bilateral meetings.
Before his departure from India, Modi had said the importance of global cooperation against black money will be a “key issue” he will highlight at the G20 summit.
“A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money,” Modi had said in a pre-departure statement.
As India attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad, Modi is expected to renew the country’s commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
At the annual summit of the Group of 20 of the world’s biggest developed and emerging economies, Modi had said he intends to discuss how it can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure, and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The two-day summit will be held from November 15. G20 accounts for 85 per cent of the world’s economic output.
During his visit, Modi will also hold talks with Prime Minister Abbott in Canberra after the G20 summit.
Modi is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.
“While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential.
“A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India’s economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood,” he said referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney besides Canberra.

The AIIMS medical board had, in its second report submitted to the police recently, confirmed that Pushkar had been killed by poison.
The, report, however did not mention the type of poison that caused Pushkar’s death.
They had suspected the use of some poison that had radioactive isotopes in it that labs in India couldn’t detect.
A senior police officer said the police were mulling sending the viscera samples to a UK-based laboratory that had facilities to test all kinds of poisons.
“It is almost clear that Pushkar died of poisoning. The biggest question now is what kind of poison was used and how did it reach her body. If these are answered, the case could head to its logical end,” the officer said on condition of anonymity.
For now, the police have asked the AIIMS panel of doctors to redo their investigations and name the poison that might have caused Pushkar’s death. But if the AIIMS team fails to do so, then the samples will be sent abroad.
The police have already seized three mobile phones and a laptop of Pushkar and sent them to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets after her death.
On Thursday, the police questioned some people related to the case but senior officials refused to divulge their identities.

Chhattisgarh sterilisation tragedy: Directors of drug company arrested; doctor blamesgovtVillagers protesting outside the state health minister's residence against underwent sterilization surgeries, in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh on Tuesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:20 am
In a late night action yesterday, the Chhattisgarh police arrested the directors of Mahavar Pharama Pvt Ltd, a manufacturer of antibiotic Ciprofloxacin consumed by the victims of the Bilaspur laparoscopic surgeries. The arrested directors are Ramesh Mahavar and his son Sumit Mahavar.
The police have said that the company did not manufacture the drugs here, bought from elsewhere and merely packaged it in the factory. The food and drug department noted that the company did not have proper equipment to manufacture drugs. A case of forgery under Section 420 of IPC has been registered against the duo.
However, these arrests raise serious questions over the health department and medicare in Chhattisgarh. The company had been operating in the state capital for over a decade. While the drug department failed to notice its allegedly illegal operations, the health ministry regularly purchased and used its medicines in bulk.
Following the ban on four drugs that were used during the surgeries, the Food and Drug Controller had raided and sealed the Raipur-based Mahavar Pharma Pvt Ltd yesterday. It is a small factory in a residential colony and does not even have a notice board indicating the company or its operations.
“We never sell to the government. We sell to drug traders, who supply it to various agencies. This antibiotic is sold at many places. We have never received any complaint,” the company said in a statement.
The dismissed Dr RK Gupta, who conducted 83 surgeries in just five hours, has also blamed the state government. “What is my fault? I am just a doctor. We were given the targets of surgeries. If we did not meet them, the administration pressurised us. The state government and Health Minister Amar Agarwal are responsible,” said Gupta, now in judicial custody.

Saradha scam: Suspended Trinamool MP Kunal Ghosh attempts suicide in prison cellComments
Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh, an accused in the multi-crore Saradha scam, took 26 sleeping pills in an alleged suicide bid inside the Kolkata jail where he has been locked up for the past year.

Ghosh, who was the CEO of Saradha’s media wing at the time the Ponzi scheme at the company unravelled, was rushed to hospital where doctors said his condition was stable.
The one-time close confidant of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had threatened this week to end his life if the CBI failed to take action against others involved in the scam.
Jail authorities filed an FIR against Ghosh as attempted suicide is a criminal offence.
"According to a complaint lodged by jail authorities, a case has been registered against Kunal Ghosh u/s section 309 of IPC," said Rajeev Mishra, joint commissioner (headquarters) of Kolkata Police.
A hospital official said Ghosh told doctors in the emergency department that he had consumed 26 pills.
“A six-member medical board has been formed to treat him. He is stable now. The team will decide when to discharge him,” said Pradip Mitra, director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research. “The contents of his stomach have been sent for forensic test.”
Prison officials failed to explain how the suspended Trinamool Congress leader managed to procure the sedatives despite being lodged in a high-security cell at the Presidency jail with two guards keeping watch.
“He was extremely depressed even during the last hearing (on Monday). We informed the court too. It is surprising how sedatives find their way inside the jail,” said Ghosh's lawyer, Soumyajit Raha.
Three letters were found in Ghosh's jail cell, sources said. One was addressed to the Chief Justice of India, another to the chief justice of the Calcutta High Court and the third to Saradha investors.
The chief minister suspended the jail superintendent as well as the doctor and nurse on duty while the state government set up a committee to probe the incident.
The incident triggered a torrent of questions from opposition leaders who said there could be a conspiracy to eliminate Ghosh by the real architects of the scam.
“If Kunal dies who will benefit? They will be senior Trinamool Congress leaders against whom he has been spilling the beans for a long time. People will take this incident as a conspiracy,” said senior state Congress leader Abdul Mannan.
The Saradha scam has turned into a major embarrassment for Trinamool chief Banerjee who has been accused by opposition parties of trying to shield some of the beneficiaries of the company’s slush funds.
The scam was caused by the collapse of an investment operation from the Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private firms that was running many unlicensed financial schemes in eastern India.
The group folded up in April last year, resulting in the loss of hundreds of crores to thousands of investors — largely from rural areas with little access to banking facilities.
During a court hearing in September, Ghosh said he was being unjustly kept behind bars while bigger beneficiaries of the scam were inaugurating community Durga Puja ceremonies.
Early on Friday, a guard deployed outside Ghosh’s cell saw the MP unconscious and informed jail officials. The local police were called and Ghosh was taken to hospital.

DDA housing scheme draw further delayed due to technical glitchesDDA housing scheme draw further delayed due to technical glitches
Sidhartha Roy , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014
First Published: 20:28 IST(13/11/2014) | Last Updated: 10:53 IST(14/11/2014)
For the applicants of Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing scheme 2014, the wait for the lucky draw is turning out to be an endless one.
 
DDA is not going to meet the latest deadline it had set itself for holding the draw – November 14. DDA is carrying out trial runs of the draw since Monday and is facing technical glitches, which is resulting in the delay.
 
The trial runs, or ‘mock draw’ are being jointly carried out by the Systems department of DDA and a team from C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) at the DDA headquarter Vikas Sadan, where the draw is going to be held.
 
“The C-DAC team has brought all the required hardware to DDA headquarter and along with our Systems officials are working almost 24X7 to ensure a smooth draw of lots,” said a senior DDA official. “The problem is the huge number of applications and the large number of errors that crept into the forms that were submitted by applicants with designated banks,” he said.
 
DDA has received total 10,08,700 applications for the 25,034 flats on offer, most of which are one bedroom flats.
 
“The trial runs are going on and is taking a lot of time because there is a lot of data to be processed. We have been facing some technical glitches too,” said DDA Vice Chairman Balvinder Kumar. “The mock draws are taking six to seven hours to complete because there are so many forms and so many categories, while we want to wrap up the draw between one to two hours,” he said.
 
“The software we are using is a bit old but the Systems department feels it is safe and time tested and don’t want to change it,” said Kumar.

Sensex Edges Higher  Trades Above 28 000You are here: Home Market
BSE Sensex, Nifty Trade Flat; IT Stocks Gain
NDTV | Updated On: November 14, 2014 09:52 (IST)
BSE Sensex and Nifty were mostly flat today with buying in IT, oil & gas, and auto stocks keeping the markets supported.
Sensex was up nearly 30 points to 27,969 while Nifty edged higher to 8,366.
Market analyst Sarvendra Srivastava says Nifty remains in the 8200-8400 range and until 8180 levels are held on, the momentum is in favour of bulls. If Nifty breaks out above 8,400 levels decisively, the index could see further 400-500 point gains, he added.
Some buying was seen in IT stocks, with Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro up between 0.60 per cent and 0.90 per cent.
Some oil & gas stocks also attracted some buying action after seeing sharp losses yesterday. ONGC rose nearly 1 per cent while HPCL gained 1.5 per cent. Global oil prices slumped to four-year-lows of below $80/barrel. Though a slide in global oil prices reduces the subsidy burden of Indian oil companies, analysts are not positive on PSU oil marketing companies.
Lancelot D'Cunha, CEO of ITI Wealth Management, said the government has the power to regulate fuel prices or introduce new duties which can reduce their profits, referring to the excise duty hike. Government policies can change the financials or valuations of the oil retailers and their valuations are also very high after the recent run-up in their shares, he added.
BPCL and HPCL were down marginally today.

Stock markets today surged to new highs with benchmark Sensex rising over 106 points to close at 28,046.66 after WPI inflation cooling to a 5-year low in October strengthened hopes of a rate cut while good earnings from bluechips like SBI boosted the sentiment.
Besides, robust buying by overseas investors and tumbling crude oil prices supported the strong momentum in stocks.
The 50-scrip NSE Nifty index spurted by 32.05 points, or 0.38 per cent, to close at new high of 8,389.90, surpassing previous record closing of 8,383.30 hit on November 12.
The 30-share BSE Sensex opened on a strong footing and continued its upward march to reclaim the key 28,000 mark to hit the day’s high of 28,093.23 as buying picked up.
After some profit-booking at record levels, the barometer settled at 28,046.66 at a fresh record closing level, clocking net gain of 106.02 points or 0.38 per cent over last close.
Thus, the Sensex bettered its previous closing peak of 28,008.90 reached on November 12. Indices have been hitting new highs after the government announced a slew of reform measures to boost economy amid positive economic data.
Driven by softening prices of fuel and food items, the WPI inflation cooled to a five year low of 1.77 per cent in October raising hopes of rate cut by the Reserve Bank next month to boost economic growth.
State-run State Bank of India posted 30.5 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 3,100.41 crore for the quarter ended September 30, pushing its shares up by 2.55 per cent.
In metal pack, Hindalco surged 3.59 per cent.
“WPI for October is one of the lowest in recent years… focus would again shift to global markets, progress on reforms and RBI monetary policy,” said Sanjeev Zarbade, Vice President- Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Other gainers that lifted indices to new highs included CIL, GAIL, Bajaj Auto, HDFC Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Infosys, TCS, ICICI Bank and RIL. Overall, 21 of 30 Sensex stocks closed up.
A firming trend at the other Asian markets and a mixed opening in Europe too influenced sentiments, brokers said.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 690.61 crore yesterday.
Sectorwise, BSE Metal index rose the most by 2.53 per cent, followed by Realty 2.35 per cent, Oil&Gas 1.06 per cent, Banking 0.72 per cent and Auto 0.62 per cent among others. In line with bullish sentiment, midcap index and smallcap, both indices ended 0.52 per cent higher.

Saradha scam: Kunal Ghosh tries to end life  three days after he threatened to dosoTMC MP Kunal Ghosh at CBI custody (Source: Express file photo by Subham Dutta)

One of the prime accused in the multi crore Saradha chit fund scam, Kunal Ghosh – a former Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabbha Member tried to commit suicide at Presidency Corrctional Home in Kolkata late last night where he was lodged for past several months. Ghosh was rushed to SSKM hospital in the wee hours of Friday when prison guards reportedly noticed him lying in his cell in an “abnormal position“ with some sleeping pill strips lying by his side.
The jail doctor was summoned immeaitely and Kunal Ghosh was moved to the SSKM hospital at about 3 am wher ehe told the attendign doc tor that he had consumed about 30/40 sleeping pills. The doctors immedaitely washed his stomach and by late afternoon his condition was stated to be stable in the CCU.

Kunal Ghosh lived upto his threat just three days ago. On November 10, while being taken to City Civil court at Bankshal in Kolkata for production, he had shouted at the waiting media persons from the prison van saying that he would commit suicide within three days if the real culprits in the Saradha case were not arrested by the CBI. He alleged that the police had let free the actual culprits while he was rotting in the jail. Earlier, too, he had pointed fingers at several top Trinamool Congress leaders for their alleged complicity in the Saradha scam and demanded that they should be arrested and prosecuted.
However, as the day grew, the state government suspended in quick succession the Jail superintendent, the medical offier and the prion guard pending by the police to ascertain the facts and circumstances of how Kunal Ghosh attenpted suicide inside the prison cell. By all standardes it was surprising as to how could he lay his hands on such a large number of sleeping pills.

The Prisidency Correctional home, the Alipore Correctional home and other central jails in Kolkata are notorious for instances when various banned items have been “smugglinged in” for jail inmates – from lifers to the ordinary. Obviously, there existed well established channels within the prisons with active collusion with prison staff for maintaining such illegal supply chains to the prison inmates from continued…

Glenn Beck Battling Mystery Illnessreddit
Glenn Beck revealed on his network The Blaze on Monday that he has been battling a series of health problems that have left doctors baffled.
The conservative media personality said the problems started when he was on Fox News and became so severe that the crew worked out hand signals to indicate when to take the camera off of him.
"We didn't know at the time what was causing me to feel as though, out of nowhere, my hands or feet or arms and legs would feel like someone had just crushed them or set them on fire or pushed broken glass into my feet," Beck said. "I can't tell you how many nights my wife would sit in the light, looking at the bottom of my feet to make sure that there really wasn't any glass in it."
At times crying, Beck explained how he has visited various doctors who were unable to figure out what was wrong.
He's also experienced sleep problems, which at first allowed him to function with just two to four hours of shut-eye per night.
"Quite honestly this isn't a symptom that you look to fix," Beck said. "If you have a ton to do, you're like, 'I don't need sleep this is great.'"
However, doctors told him he hadn't had any REM sleep in about a decade. And soon, other problems appeared, including what he called "time collapse," or the inability to remember if he had met someone just a week ago or years earlier.
Beck said he suffered in ways he publicly revealed at the time, including macular dystrophy and vocal chord problems, as well as some had not, such as seizures that would strike while flying and in times of exertion.
"Most afternoons my hands will start to shake or my hands and feet begin to curl up and I become in a fetal position," Beck said. "When it gets real bad my friends just kind of try to uncurl me."
In New York about 18 months ago, Beck went through a battery of tests, including one for traumatic brain injury.
"I did so poorly on this test the doctors shared the results with my wife and didn't focus on them with me. I never wanted to see the results," Beck said. "I knew I was functioning at about the bottom 10 percent. I knew when I couldn't figure out simple math problems or remember a series of words I was in real trouble."
Beck said doctors told him he may be unable to function in five or 10 years.
"It has baffled some of the best doctors in the world," Beck said. "It has frightened me and my family as we didn't know what was happening."
At one point, Beck looked into the possibility that he was being poisoned.
Beck said he moved from New York to Dallas because he believed the better climate might help. He didn't realize it at the time, but he also moved near Carrick Brain Centers , a brain rehabilitation center that specializes in experimental therapies that are not covered by insurance.
There Beck was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and adrenal fatigue, among other things. He said these conditions are being treated with diet, lifestyle changes and hormones.
Beck said his faith has played a major role in his recovery.
"My doctors told me that it was my faith in God that was powering me through all this, that I shouldn't be standing," Beck said, adding that the move from New York to Dallas may have saved his life.
Beck's discussion of his illness and how it has affected his plans for his upstart media company, The Blaze , begin in the clip above and continue below.

SBI gives blueprint for 50 000cr power fundComments
India's largest lender, State Bank of India, has submitted details of the proposed power sector fund, which is likely to be set up with a corpus of Rs. 50,000 crore for reviving stalled power projects in the country. It will also help recover thousands of crores worth of banking sector funds that are stuck in such projects.
According to the concept paper worked out by SBI, a copy of which is available with HT, the fund would have 49% contribution from power sector PSUs, with the balance coming from banks and foreign investors.
"The fund would provide equity support and undertake some debt restructuring," said the minutes of the October 17 meeting, quoting SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya.
The meeting was held at SBI's head office in New Delhi and attended by senior officials of the finance and power ministries, along with heads of banks and financial institutions including SBI, Punjab National Bank and India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd, besides the Asso­ciation of Power Producers (APP), which represents the country's top power companies.
The proposal of the fund was first mooted in June soon after power and coal minister Piyush Goyal had taken charge and met the bankers on power sector issues. SBI was asked to work out the finer details.
"The government is looking at options by which it can become feasible for banks to fund long-term projects, which include power as well. At present, there are a few issues that concern banks and these need to be addressed for speedy financing decisions," a senior SBI official said.
Private sector companies have contributed significantly to the installed capacity in the power sector during 2007 to 2012, with their share rising to 67% by August 2014 from 55% in 2012.
State-run power sector financial institutions including Rural Electrification Corp, Power Finance Corp and cash-rich companies such as NTPC, along with various public and private sector banks, are likely to contribute to the corpus of the fund, officials with knowledge of the proceedings said.
"As much as 136,000 MW of capacity, out of India's total installed capacity of 254,000 MW, involving an investment of over Rs. 6.23 lakh crore, has been added by the private sector," according to a presentation made by the APP during the October 17 meeting. "The capital charge on the investments (by the private sector) is about Rs. 90,000 crore."
Fuel shortage, high coal import prices, a depreciating rupee, delays in land acquisition, transmission bottlenecks and poor financial health of distribution companies are some of the issues plaguing the power sector. Besides time and cost overruns, the projects are also facing funding constraints. This has resulted in higher non-performing assets (NPAs) - loans that do not yield returns - for banks, besides affecting economic growth and the overall investment climate.
High cost of alternative fuels and the reluctance of discoms to procure power have resulted in substantial decline in revenues of power companies, leading to cash flow issues. The high construction risk is keeping away new investors and project developers are finding it difficult to manage long-term contractual obligations.

Maha uncertainty: Crouching Shiv Sena  hidden CongressCongress
(The Sena would now be looking…)
MUMBAI: BJP's idea of winning the trust motion of its minority government in the Maharashtra assembly through a voice vote has brought in an element of uncertainty to its stability. The Shiv Sena would now be looking for every opportunity to corner the Devendra Fadnavis government and may get support from other opposition parties too.
According to the Constitution, the trust vote has given the government a six-month's lease but an aggressive Opposition could topple the government after that, if they pose a united challenge. The Shiv Sena, which has 63 seats in the Maharashtra assembly, sounded very frustrated and jilted as its MLAs occupied the Opposition benches on Wednesday.
It accused BJP of a tacit deal with NCP to avoid actual voting in the House, which the party said was equivalent to a back-door entry. Congress claimed it amounted to cheating voters. Congress and Sena would be looking to oppose every bill that the government tables and unless NCP is humoured to support the government each time, it would be impossible for the government to function.
"This voice vote route that BJP has chosen, keeps us in the dark. It keeps all voters of the state and members of the assembly too in the dark about how many members from which parties support this government.
BJP has avoided a division on such an important issue like the trust vote because many MLAs of BJP are unhappy about Fadnavis as chief minister. They would have voted against the party" claimed senior Sena MLA Ramdas Kadam.
"BJP does not trust NCP, so they wanted to hide behind the voice majority. Why should open voting be held on a trust motion and why should division of votes not be declared? We will oppose it at every stage" said Congress leader Radhakishna Vikhe-Patil.
"This is a black day in Maharashtra's history. Democratic values have been compromised. We will take the issue to the Governor and then to the people of Maharashtra. We will demand another trust vote," said former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan.

RPI moves Bombay HC seeking to dissolution of Maharashtra Assembly
PTI Nov 12, 2014, 11.22PM IST
(RPI said the new assembly…)
MUMBAI: RPI led by Prakash Ambedkar today moved the Bombay High Court seeking dissolution of the newly-formed assembly in Maharashtra and imposition of President's rule, contending that the government has been functioning "illegally" since November
A division bench of Justices V M Kanade and Anuja Prabhudessai kept the petition for hearing tomorrow.
The petition, filed by 69-year-old Republican Party of India (RPI) Secretary Jairam Pawar, said it was challenging the action of political parties to form government and take oath after the dissolution of the previous legislative assembly.
It said the new assembly had not come into force within the stipulated time prescribed as per the government notification issued on September 20.
The petition said that a notification was issued to dissolve the Assembly on September 20 and the elections were to be conducted as per the electoral programme on October 15. The results were to be declared on October 19.
As per the notification, the earlier legislative assembly was to dissolve on November 8, 2014, and hence the council of ministers was duty-bound to see and ensure that the next legislative assembly should be in place and should be summoned on or before that date, states the petition.
However, the council of ministers took oath on November 10, it said.
Article 163 of the Constitution of India provides that there shall be a council of ministers with Chief Minister as the head to aid and advice the Governor in administration of its functions and discharge of its duties. Article 164(2) makes it clear that the council of ministers is responsible to the legislative assembly, the petition said.
The petition prays the Governor be directed "to remove and or dissolve the council of ministers for the state of Maharashtra and implement the President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution in the state of Maharashtra."
It further seeks to prohibit the council of ministers from implementing any decision taken by them till appropriate orders are passed by the central and state government in accordance with the Constitution of India.
The petition sought an interim stay on any decision taken by the council of ministers from November 8 till the final order is passed by the High Court.

Narendra Modi wins big at WTO  trade deal set on trackFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a major victory at the World Trade Organisation with the US agreeing to push for the changes India wanted in the food subsidy mechanism. The agreement with the US comes days ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane where leaders of 20 major economies will, among other things, discuss ways to boost global trade by restoring confidence in the multilateral trading system and the WTO.
US President Barack Obama will attend the G20 summit along with Modi.
Addressing mediapersons after a last-minute phone call with top US officials, commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman said India and the US had resolved their differences on the issue of public shareholdings by developed countries “in a manner that addresses our concerns”.
After the agreement, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo said the world trading system was now “back on track” and if all WTO members ratified the proposal, it would give a “major boost to the WTO”.
While India had not breached the WTO limits on food subsidies, India blocked the trade facilitation agreement (TFA) in July on the grounds that the WTO rules were archaic and hurt the interests of countries like India — WTO rules on food subsidies calculate these based on prices prevalent in 1986-88. Following this, developed countries had criticised India for playing spoilsport and ruining the first agreement reached by the WTO in two decades.
As per the current WTO rules, ‘trade distorting’ domestic support for agricultural products cannot be more than 10% of the value of production — that value of production, however, was fixed at 1986-88 prices.
It has been argued that, at the Bali ministerial, a peace clause had been agreed to, so India had till 2017 to sort out issues relating to its food subsidies. The government had, however, argued that its best chance for getting a change in the WTO rules was when there was a big deal at stake, like the TFA that, by easing global customs procedures, is expected to add $1 trillion to the global economy and, as a result, create 21 million jobs.
After Sitharaman’s statement, a statement from the US government said: “The US and India move WTO’s landmark trade facilitation agreement forward.”
The statement said, “The bilateral agreement makes clear that a mechanism under which WTO Members will not challenge such food security programs under WTO dispute settlement procedures will remain in place until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted.” With this bilateral agreement in place, this will be put to the larger WTO General Council on December 11-12, but this is largely expected to be a formality now.
The agreement means that while the UPA government had won a four-year peace clause at Bali, the NDA has managed to get a permanent peace clause in place. Till there is a peace clause, no country can take India to the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Board and get it to reduce its subsidies to either farmers or to consumers getting foodgrains through the public distribution system.
Sitharaman had on many occasions denied India was indulging in political brinkmanship at the WTO when India’s stance meant the TFA was getting derailed. The Bali solution, she had said, was an imperfect agreement.
Grain gain:
India holds back trade facilitation agreement in July
Said WTO farm subsidy clause needed fixing first
Countries like US criticised India for brinkmanship
US, India agree to a permanent peace clause
Indian farm subsidies will no longer be challenged at WTO
Will likely be ratified by WTO on Dec 12

UN official wants international support in fight against Boko HaramUN's representative for central Africa has called on more international support in the struggle against Boko Haram.
By: Agence-France Presse | Libreville | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:03 am
The UN’s special representative for central Africa has called on increased international support in the struggle against Boko Haram, with thousands of Nigerians having fled and cross-border attacks on the rise.
“Deadly attacks by Boko Haram have gone beyond Nigeria’s borders and now constitute a threat for neighbouring countries,” Abdoulaye Bathily told reporters in the Gabon capital Libreville yesterday.
“Cameroon is one of the main victims,” he added, referring to Nigeria’s neighbour to the east.
Bathily said he was launching “an appeal to the international community to mobilise more in support of states’ efforts in the battle against this terrorist group, whose atrocities have caused a worrying stream of refugees in neighbouring countries.”
Between June and October, more than 17,000 Nigerians have arrived at a refugee camp in Minawao, northern Cameroon, he said.
Local officials and those from the UN refugee agency estimate between 4,000 and 5,000 new arrivals in the region each week, many of them women and children requiring immediate attention.
“If nothing is done urgently, it is very likely that a humanitarian disaster will follow that would further complicate the security challenges,” said Bathily.
Boko Haram’s five-year insurgency based in northeastern Nigeria has killed thousands and forced scores to flee their homes. Nigerian security forces have in turn been accused of major abuses, including extra-judicial killings and indiscriminate arrests.
The extremists have in recent weeks seized a growing amount of territory in Nigeria’s northeast. The group has claimed to be fighting for the creation of an Islamic state and for the release of detained members.

Aditya Birla Group prepares second line of l...Aditya Birla
(The process, which was set…)
MUMBAI: Ever since he joined the Aditya Birla Group from Hindustan Lever in 2004, Dilip Gaur's leadership skills had been put to the test in three disparate businesses such as edible oils, carbon black and copper. Little did he realise then that the leadership transition would eventually mean a larger role for him in the $40-billion group. Last month, Gaur was elevated as the deputy managing director of the group's cement company, UltraTech .
As business environment becomes increasingly competitive, billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla-controlled business conglomerate has institutionalised a leadership back-up plan by anointing deputy managing directors at its group companies.
The process, which was set in motion with the appointment of Ambrish Jain as the deputy MD of Idea in 2011, is taking a definitive shape. Group companies such as Idea, UIltraTech, Hindalco and Aditya Birla Financial Services now have deputy heads. While Satish Pai has taken charge as the deputy MD of Hindalco from February this year, Pankaj Razdan is the deputy chief executive of financial services business. Lalit Naik, who used to be the deputy MD of Aditya Birla Nuvo, has recently taken over as the managing director. The group is exploring the possibility of appointing deputy MDs in other group companies.
"It is tough for one person to carry the burden as the business environment has become complex and challenging. So, it is important to create a second line of support to the heads of various businesses," said Santrupt Mishra, director — human resources and CEO, carbon black business at Aditya Birla Group.
The metals-to-telecom group is experimenting on a model that combines the intrinsic strengths of two different people. As the deputy MD, Gaur is also the chief manufacturing officer. So, Gaur, who had proved his project skills at Hindalco, is in charge of research & development and technical skills. "Being a chemical engineer, it comes naturally to him," said Mishra.
Management experts feel that the move to create a second line of leadership signals the group's transformation into "democratic professionalism".
"Most Indian family businesses have been practising a limited level of professionalism. The Birla Group has now confirmed their movement from what I call 'directed professionalism' to 'democratic professionalism' wherein high quality team members are respected and treated equally by the lead promoter," said Kavil Ramachandran, Thomas Schmidheiny Chair Professor of Family Business and Wealth Management, Indian School of Business. "This is how most family-controlled businesses have grown global in any country," he added. However, this process of talent grooming and systematic succession planning is over a decade old and institutionalised at the group.
Unlike Satish Pai, who was initially hired from Sclumberger as CEO of Hindalco's aluminium business, the group had handpicked the second line of leadership from within. As part of the succession planning initiative, leaders who showed uncanny ability to rally people were chosen for the top posts. Jain, who joined Idea when it was a very small regional operator, proved his leadership skills and competencies, supporting the company's rise as the third-largest telecom operator.

A third Ebola patient is headed to the special Biocontainment Unit at the Nebraska Medical Center this weekend, according to news reports Thursday.
The Associated Press identified the patient as Martin Salia, a surgeon who was infected with the virus while treating victims in Sierra Leone, one of the hardest-hit areas of West Africa.
The patient is a Sierra Leonean national who is a permanent resident of the United States and lives in Maryland, AP reported, citing an anonymous source. He reportedly was working at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone, when he came down with Ebola symptoms on Nov. 6.
He tested negative for the virus at that time, AP reported. When he was tested again on Monday, the results came back positive.
The patient will arrive Saturday at the University of Nebraska facility, the Omaha World-Herald reported, citing an unidentified person "with knowledge of the patient's impending arrival."
He is in stable condition at an Ebola treatment center in Freetown, AP reported.
The university would not confirm the reports, saying in a written statement that the staff has "been in a state of readiness" to treat Ebola patients since August, when the State Department visited its Biocontainment Unit, the nation's largest.
"As with previous patients we've treated here in recent months, per State Department regulations, we would only have confirmation when a plane is en route with a patient aboard," spokesman Taylor Wilson said. "This is not the case right now. If we have confirmation of a patient headed to our facility, we will share what information we can with you. In the meantime, our organization is ready if needed."
The Biocontainment Unit has already successfully treated and released two others: Dr. Rick Sacra, a missionary delivering babies in Liberia, and Ashoka Mukpo, an NBC News freelance cameraman who also became infected while working in Liberia.
American doctor with Ebola to be flown to Nebraska
Among the special features of the 10-bed unit are air-handling, filtration and ultraviolet systems to keep micro-organisms from spreading beyond a patient's room.
Earlier Thursday, Ron Klain, the White House Ebola-response coordinator, said the country would "see other cases of Ebola in the United States, as the president has said, occasionally and sporadically."
New York doctor is free of Ebola
He hailed the successful treatment of a New York doctor infected while treating Ebola patients in Guinea.
"It's a milestone because it shows that our health care system can successfully identify, isolate and treat an Ebola patient, and return him home healthy," he told representatives of nonprofit and faith-based groups meeting at the White House.
"We are not at the beginning of the end or even the end of the beginning, but we are at the throes of this effort in West Africa with interventions that can work," he added.

Asia dips in wake of soft data  oil hovers near lows2
"Shockingly, (China's) imports contracted by 6.7 percent year-on-year – their weakest performance since the Lehman crisis (except the volatile Lunar New Year-related period), said Dariusz Kowalczyk, economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.
"This is partly a reflection of lower commodity prices and base effects, but these two factors cannot fully explain the weak import number and we have to assume that poor domestic demand has played a part. This means that pressure will rise on the government to do more to stimulate growth," he said.
The Australian dollar, sensitive to the economic fortunes of of China, its main export destination, touched a new 4-1/2 year low of $0.8288 .
The disappointing Chinese and Japanese data contrasted sharply with Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls that showed employment in November surged by 321,000, easily topping forecasts for 230,000 new jobs.
The dollar was steady at 121.580 yen  after touching a new seven-year high of 121.860. The dollar index <.DXY> hovered near a 5-1/2 year high of 89.467.
A bullish dollar worked against crude oil, with the stronger greenback making commodities denominated in the U.S. currency less affordable for holders of other currencies.
U.S. crude  was down 77 cents at $65.07 a barrel, heading towards a five-year low of $63.72 struck a week ago, with a strong U.S. jobs report doing little to lift the bearish mood.
Some commentators focused on the positives of cheaper oil.
"The good news is that the fall in crude oil prices will provide well over two-thirds of the world's consumers with a windfall gain, particularly, the U.S., North Asian and Indian consumer. It is of modest help to Europe as well," Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies, said in a note to clients.
"This windfall gain ought to boost global GDP by around 0.5% for every US$20/barrel drop in oil prices (with a lag)."
The dollar stood tall against the euro, which languished near a two-year low of $1.2270 .
The euro and yen are expected to remain on the defensive against the dollar indefinitely as the strong U.S. jobs data  further contrasted the divergent monetary policy paths of the Fed and its European and Japanese counterparts which are mired   in underwhelming easing schemes.
While the Fed is seen to have moved a step nearer to hiking rates, the European Central Bank is under pressure to enhance its stimulus programme while the Bank of Japan remains far from reaching its inflation target.

Residential land prices in Bengaluru are set to go north with an increase in guidance value taking effect on Thursday. The second revision in 15 months has seen guidance value in some prime areas touch Rs 20,000/sqft.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BENGALURU: Residential land prices in Bengaluru are set to go north with an increase in guidance value taking effect on Thursday. The second revision in 15 months has seen guidance value in some prime areas touch Rs 20,000/sqft.
The hike in guidance value - the minimum valuation at which properties have to be registered - ranges between 5% and 30% across the city. Guidance value determines stamp duty and other charges to be paid during registration.
Sadashivanagar is the most expensive locality in Bengaluru, followed by Malleswaram and Cunningham Road, according to the official rates announced on Thursday.
Guidance values were last revised in August 2013 and this revision comes amid government assertions that it'll be an annual affair. The value has been hiked across the state.
"We have increased the guidance value by an average of 10-12% across the state in our attempt to bridge the gap between market value and guidance value," said N Prakash, inspector-general of registration and commissioner of stamps.
Finance department sources said the hike was inevitable as revenue from stamp duties had seen a slump of 10-15% this year. Following the revision, the revenue department expects to meet the target of Rs 6,800 crore in the next four months, they added.
The government saw a good opportunity to increase the guidance value and check its dwindling revenue since the real estate market was booming, sources said.
"Though the revision will bring more revenue to the exchequer, our main aim was to check the black money component in property transactions. Actual transactions often take place much above the government's prescribed rates (guidance value)," he added.
While guidance values have been increased across the board by average 10-50% across Karnataka twice in the past 15 months, officials contend they're still lower than the prevailing market rates.
The realty sector fears an increase in guidance value will reduce transactions in Bengaluru. "This is not good either for the industry or homebuyers. Instead of increasing guidance value randomly, the government should look to conduct a scientific study of rates through an outside agency with inputs from both government and developers. Such a study will give a fair amount of fixing guidance values," Suresh Hari, secretary, CREDAI Bangalore.
Farook Mahmood, chairman & managing director, Silverline Group , said frequent increase in guidance value is not good as it creates unnecessary price hike and ultimately burdens the buyer who is already coping with VAT and service tax, among others.
"We've also found that in many locations the actual values are much lower than the proposed new guidance values," he added.
Realty experts point out that the market value of properties on the top end is Rs 33,000/sqft to Rs 35,000 /sqft.
Apartments in Kingfisher Towers (the homes at UB City ) continue to hold the record of being the most expensive residential properties, with guidance value hovering between Rs 20,250/sqft and Rs 21,350/sqft.
Guidance value in 90% of Sadashivanagar is Rs 20,000. The lowest guidance value in the locality, said to be home to the first-generation rich post-independence, is Rs 15,000.
Palace Orchards - a premium residential locality stretching between Cavuery Theatre and Bashyam Circle in Sadashivnagar - has the second highest guidance value: Rs 20,000/sqft.

Machil: Army court sentences five soldiers to lifeComments
A military court sentenced five soldiers, including two officers, to life imprisonment on Thursday for the staged killing of three Kashmiri civilians and passing it off as an anti-militancy operation in Jammu and Kashmir's Machil sector in 2010.
It is a rare case of soldiers being punished in Kashmir where the army is an object of hate and the target of frequent protests because of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which gives it sweeping powers to search, arrest and shoot people.
The verdict, hailed by political parties in Kashmir but dismissed by some separatists as a political move with an eye on assembly elections, comes at a time when the army is under fire in the Valley for killing two Kashmiri boys mistaken for terrorists.
The men were allegedly lured by a former special police officer and his accomplices to Machil on the pretext of offering a job. They were later handed over to the army for Rs. 50,000 each and shot dead by troops in a staged encounter near the border with Pakistan on April 29, 2010. The army described them as Pakistani militants trying to sneak in from the Machil sector along the Line of Control. Their bodies were exhumed on May 28, 2010.
The controversial Machil killings triggered widespread protests and bloodshed in the Kashmir Valley in which 113 people were killed. They also led to calls for scrapping the contentious AFSPA, which the army says is necessary for battling militancy in the state.
Chief minister Omar Abdullah welcomed the sentencing and called it a "watershed moment" in Kashmir's history.
"This is a watershed moment. No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases. Faith in institutions disappeared. I hope that we never see such #Machil fake encounter type of incidents ever again and let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try," Abdullah tweeted.
The soldiers found guilty and recommended for life term are the commanding officer of 4 Rajput Regiment, the unit involved in the encounter, Colonel Dinesh Pathania, Captain Upendra, Havildar Devinder and Lance Naiks Arun Kumar and Lakhmi. All services benefits of the soldiers have also been suspended.
"The process is still not completed as the confirmation of the sentence is yet to be done by appropriate authority (Northern Army commander)," said an army officer in Delhi.
Court martial proceedings were ordered against six soldiers in December 2013; they ended in September this year. One of them was not found guilty. HT reported on December 26, 2013 that if convicted, the accused could get life imprisonment.
Kashmiri separatists said the verdict was a good beginning if it is followed by justice in similar rights abuse cases.
"It's very positive. We welcome it but the real test lies if justice is done in other cases like Gaw Kadal and Hawal massacres that left more than 100 dead. It's good to make troops accountable," moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told HT.
But some Kashmiri separatists said the sentence was a political move aimed at assembly elections in the state as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to expand its support to the Muslim-dominated Valley where it has no base.
"The elections are round the corner. There is political design in the sudden army magnanimity. India was never serious in delivering justice in Kashmir. Then it should do justice in hundreds of other such cases. The biggest justice is granting the right of self-determination to people," said Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani.

Why Burger King  Wendy s Queuing Up to Set Shop in IndiaBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Big names in the fast food industry are queuing up to grab a pie of the quick service restaurant (QSR) market in India. Burger King, the world's second largest hamburger chain, opened its first outlet in Delhi on Sunday, while Ohio-based Wendy's is likely to set up shop in the first half of next year.
Foreign brands are eying the Indian market despite the presence of well entrenched players such as McDonald's, Domino's and Haldiram's. The fact that margins of existing players are under stress amid a prolonged economic slowdown also seems to have little impact on new entrants' decision to set up shop in the country.
In the September quarter, Westlife Development, a company whose subsidiary Hardcastle Restaurants is a master franchisee of McDonald's in India, reported a 600 per cent year-on-year drop in operating margins. Jubilant FoodWorks, which operates the Domino's Pizza and Dunkin' Donuts brands in India and whose shares are well tracked, reported a 280 points drop in year-on-year margins in the September quarter. Its same-store sales growth (SSSG) also declined 5.3 per cent during the quarter.
Most companies see tough days ahead despite signs of early recovery. Jubilant FoodWorks' management said it is not seeing any positive change in consumer buying patterns and expects the weakness in consumer demand to continue in the near term.
"The management guided for negative SSSG to continue for another two quarters and for SSSG to hit high-single digits only over a 4- to 8-quarter period. This is despite the second half of FY14 having negative SSSG in the base," Nomura says.
Consumers have held back spending amid the economic slowdown in India. Low spending has weighed on demand forcing companies to come up with promotional offers despite a sharp jump in input prices. High attrition and real estate rental costs have also impacted profitability, analysts say.
Current market environment has impacted shares of listed companies. Jubilant FoodWorks shares are up just 13.50 per cent, while Westlife Development shares are down 17 per cent over the last one year. In contrast, the Sensex has gained over 38 per cent during the same period.
New entrants, however, believe that a recovery in around the corner. Raj Varman, chief executive of Burger King India, told NDTV that the food business is a recession-proof business. Mr Varman's Burger King is coming up with 12 restaurants in Mumbai and Delhi over the next few weeks. ( Watch the full interview )
The biggest draw for these new players is the massive growth prospects in India, analysts say. According to a report by Technopak, the QSR segment in India is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25 per cent to reach revenues of $3.2 billion by 2018 from $1.06 billion in 2013.
There's also a growing belief that demand will come back quicker-than-expected as inflation cools and disposable incomes rise. "The Indian market is on the verge of substantial recovery... Growing disposable income and rising number of dual income families mean the headroom is enormous," Mr Varman added.
A sharp fall in inflation will also bring down input costs and increase profitability. Analysts also say that most big foreign brands have deep pockets and they can afford to play the waiting game.

Fadnavis govt invalid; ask it to prove majority: Sena to Maha GovernorAjay Chowdhary
("But if the government itself…)
MUMBAI: Sharpening its attack on the Devendra Fadnavis government for its "manipulative" victory in the trust vote in Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, Shiv Sena on Thursday met Governor C Vidyasagar Rao here and demanded that it should be declared a "minority" government and he should order a fresh confidence motion.
Sena alleged the Fadnavis government is "invalid" as it has failed to fulfil the provisions of Article 164.
Sena leader Diwakar Raote said they have requested the governor to ask BJP to prove majority "or else declare it a minority government and seek a fresh trust vote".
"The President has appointed Governor to uphold the Constitution. But if the government itself is unconstitutional (then) is it not his duty to take action in the interest of people?," Raote said after meeting Rao at Raj Bhavan.
The fledgling BJP government won the trust motion through a voice vote on Wednesday, drawing angry reactions from Sena and Congress that have accused BJP of failing to prove its majority and "strangulating democracy".

Shiv Sena will have to go back to streets to stay relevant in MaharashtraShiv Sena will have to go back to streets to stay relevant in Maharashtra

(“If Sena plays an obstructionist…)
NEW DELHI: When friends turn foes, their rivalry has a remarkable intensity given their knowledge of each other. This couldn't be truer than in the case of Maharashtra's two biggest parties after the October assembly polls, BJP and Shiv Sena .
With the BJP proving its majority in the state assembly on Wednesday, the state's politics appears to have entered a new phase where the pro-Hindutva parties would be ranged against each other as the singular ruling party and main opposition. For a polity dominated by Congress and other Centre-Left parties, and Socialists and Communists taking up opposition space till two decades ago, this is a development without precedent anywhere in the country.
But the tentative nature of the government's majority and Sena's decision to take up opposition space implies that political volatility is here to stay, notwithstanding Sharad Pawarled NCP's efforts to 'ensure a stable' BJP government. Sena spokesperson and Saamna editor Sanjay Raut told ET, "The next six months will be eventful." He said Sena will not desert its "core behaviour and beliefs". He added: "This government is unstable. Since its birth it is in the ICU. It has compromised with Hindutva ideology by collaborating with NCP".
But observers believe the emerging rivalry is only a public manifestation of troubles that were swept under the carpet earlier to save the alliance.
Congress and NCP will have to work in strengthening their neglected organisations while opposing the excessive 'Saffron domination'. Analyst Kumar Ketkar said: "Hindutva part of the alliance was there only between 1990 and 1995, during and in the aftermath of the Ayodhya agitation. After that, Hindutva was the nameplate of a divided house in which both Sena and BJP stayed in separate spaces. It was only the outsiders who presumed they stayed together. Those who ventured inside knew the reality. The differences were sociological and cultural.
Sena's backing to Pratibha Patil and Pranab Mukherjee , even when BJP opposed both is a case in point. To remain relevant, Sena will have to go back to the streets now." RSS mouthpiece Organiser's editor Prafulla Ketkar said: "If Sena plays an obstructionist role against the Fadnavis government , there will be a public backlash against it that will help BJP. Haryana and Maharashtra are latest examples where regional parties have lost influence. It was easy for the Sena to be an opposition party when Congress was in power, but that is no longer the case. Core group of the Sena is aware of this, and that is why it did not go to the governor to demand a trust vote again."

Saradha scam-accused Kunal Ghosh attempts suicide in jail by consuming sedativesComments
Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh, an accused in the multi-crore Saradha scam, took 26 sleeping pills in an alleged suicide bid inside the Kolkata jail where he has been locked up for the past year.
Kunal Ghosh, the CEO of the erstwhile media houses run by Saradha Group, had threatened suicide in front of a judge on Monday unless the influential people named in the scam were not arrested within 72 hours. (PTI Photo)
Ghosh, who was the CEO of Saradha’s media wing at the time the Ponzi scheme at the company unravelled, was rushed to hospital where doctors said his condition was stable.
The one-time close confidant of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had threatened this week to end his life if the CBI failed to take action against others involved in the scam.
Jail authorities filed an FIR against Ghosh as attempted suicide is a criminal offence.
"According to a complaint lodged by jail authorities, a case has been registered against Kunal Ghosh u/s section 309 of IPC," said Rajeev Mishra, joint commissioner (headquarters) of Kolkata Police.
A hospital official said Ghosh told doctors in the emergency department that he had consumed 26 pills.
“A six-member medical board has been formed to treat him. He is stable now. The team will decide when to discharge him,” said Pradip Mitra, director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research. “The contents of his stomach have been sent for forensic test.”
Prison officials failed to explain how the suspended Trinamool Congress leader managed to procure the sedatives despite being lodged in a high-security cell at the Presidency jail with two guards keeping watch.
“He was extremely depressed even during the last hearing (on Monday). We informed the court too. It is surprising how sedatives find their way inside the jail,” said Ghosh's lawyer, Soumyajit Raha.
Three letters were found in Ghosh's jail cell, sources said. One was addressed to the Chief Justice of India, another to the chief justice of the Calcutta High Court and the third to Saradha investors.
The chief minister suspended the jail superintendent as well as the doctor and nurse on duty while the state government set up a committee to probe the incident.
The incident triggered a torrent of questions from opposition leaders who said there could be a conspiracy to eliminate Ghosh by the real architects of the scam.
“If Kunal dies who will benefit? They will be senior Trinamool Congress leaders against whom he has been spilling the beans for a long time. People will take this incident as a conspiracy,” said senior state Congress leader Abdul Mannan.
The Saradha scam has turned into a major embarrassment for Trinamool chief Banerjee who has been accused by opposition parties of trying to shield some of the beneficiaries of the company’s slush funds.
The scam was caused by the collapse of an investment operation from the Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private firms that was running many unlicensed financial schemes in eastern India.
The group folded up in April last year, resulting in the loss of hundreds of crores to thousands of investors — largely from rural areas with little access to banking facilities.
During a court hearing in September, Ghosh said he was being unjustly kept behind bars while bigger beneficiaries of the scam were inaugurating community Durga Puja ceremonies.
Early on Friday, a guard deployed outside Ghosh’s cell saw the MP unconscious and informed jail officials. The local police were called and Ghosh was taken to hospital.

How Narendra Modi can solidify India s appeal to fickle global investorsHow Narendra Modi can solidify India's appeal to fickle global investors
By Ruchir Sharma,  | 13 Nov, 2014, 01.12PM IST
The consensus GDP growth forecast for 2015 has been falling steadily for other large emerging markets, but is ticking higher for India. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
The global investment community is known for its manic mood swings, but even by that standard its rediscovered love for India is neck-snapping. Cast as a submerging nation a year ago, the country is now the toast of the fast money crowd. This year they've poured more money into India than into any other emerging country, and have helped to make Mumbai one of the hottest stock markets in the world, with a gain of nearly 30%.
No other developing country has undergone this kind of image upheaval. India has morphed in the eyes of the world from a star to a dud to a star again, and all within the last five years. For now, however, there are good reasons why India seems to be everyone's favourite emerging nation.
It is the only big one that has stopped disappointing its international suitors. The consensus GDP growth forecast for 2015 has been falling steadily for other large emerging markets, but is ticking higher for India. One big factor is the fall in prices for oil and other commodities, which has sent commodity-exporting economies like Brazil and Russia into recession , but is a boost for a big energy importer like India.
Better yet, low oil prices help take the edge off of inflation in India, now one of the very few nations enjoying the auspicious combination of increasing growth and falling inflation. The current account deficit too has declined from 5% of GDP in 2013 to about 2% this year in India, even as it deteriorates elsewhere. The rupee has lost 6% of its value against the surging dollar, but other currencies at the heart of the 2013 scare have fallen harder since then, by 15% on average. Investment has yet to pick up in India, but investment is flat to flailing everywhere else, too.
India is also the only emerging nation that has delivered on hopes for new leadership. Six big developing countries held pivotal national elections this year, and global markets were eagerly anticipating the victory of reform-minded leaders, especially in Brazil, Indonesia and India. As it happened, only Narendra Modi won with a clear mandate.
Elsewhere in the emerging world, politics has lost its economic promise. Russia and Turkey remain under the control of aging autocrats with waning interest in reform. China's leaders seem hobbled by the unmanageable debt burden that is dragging down its growth rate. Mexican President Pena Nieto's big-bang attack on monopolies has generated surprisingly little pop for economic growth and his popularity ratings are declining.
In Brazil, the markets were rooting for the defeat of Workers Party President Dilma Rousseff , but she narrowly won last month. High hopes for President Joko Widodo of Indonesia are fading, with the realisation that he lacks the parliamentary backing to push real change. Drop all these disappointments, and only Modi survives as a potential reformer who has the clout to get things done. Though some critics say Modi has so far made only painless changes, his recent call for a "trans-formative" budget in 2015 has global investors assuming that the big-bang reform is on its way.
So why wouldn't everyone embrace India? The hype is itself a worrying sign. The risk is that the country will start believing its own reviews, and get complacent all over again. India has a long record of abandoning reform when the future looks bright, which helps explain why in recent decades — including the post-1991 liberalisation era — there has never been any five-year period when it has grown more than a point or two faster than the emerging world average, even though it should be relatively easy to grow fast from India's low base.
With the annual growth rate of emerging economies likely to average around 4% for the rest of this decade, India will have to break out of its normal path if it wants to achieve a growth rate of 7-8%.

(The government is also planning…)
NEW DELHI | BENGALURU: Indian government software applications are set to make the shift to open source, potentially boosting the pace at which such programmes are developed, and leading to millions of dollars in savings by moving away from proprietary systems.
The government is readying a policy that calls for open source software to be used as part of the Digital India initiative. The government is also planning to create a Github-like repository of software that can be collaboratively developed.
"We don't want to make it a question of ideology but wherever possible, we want to make use of open source," RS Sharma, secretary, department of electronics and information technology, told ET. "We are also preparing something like a SourceForge, where we will open up the source code of all the existing software and crowd source development like on Github," he said.
Github and SourceForge are popular internet repositories for software code that can be shared and revised by many people.
Experts feel that this will radically improve egovernance and add up significant savings as code and applications can be reused. Governments in India are expected to spend $6.4 billion on IT products and services in 2014, according to Gartner. "The advantage is that every consulting firm will not have to re-invent the software," said Sharma. The policy intends to speed up development and deployment of e-governance projects across various sectors in the government.
"Open source has offered us the best way to out of vendor lock-in and unpredictable financial commitments," said Jay Pullur, founder and CEO, Pramati Technologies, who is also part of software product think tank Ispirt.
According to an early version of the 'Policy On Collaborative Application Development by Opening the Source Code of Government Applications', accessed by ET, the source code of hundreds of custom applications run by various government bodies is to be shared among government agencies and maintained in a common repository.
"The open code policy will ensure faster deployment of IT projects, speeding up the pace of innovation and reducing failure rates of projects," said Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Alchemy Business Solutions LLP, a company focused on technology for development in Indian language computing and open source education technology.
The repository will avoid duplication of applications and solutions to a large extent. For instance, a state wanting to adopt a particular application just has to go to the repository and customise it. "It is perverse that each state develops its own treasury application from scratch when it could be the same code," said Hariharan.
While open source experts agree that the policy is a step in the right direction, they caution that like most government initiatives, it would make a real impact only if implemented well. "Because open source is open code, you can rework on it, re-conceptualise it. And India would need a lot," said Parminder Jeet Singh, executive director at IT for Change .
Pullur said, "Given the diversity and plurality of the nation, open source adoption is the best approach and rightly chosen by the government." Singh added that India has had a policy for open standards, which was drafted in 2010, but its implementation was "very shabby". He hoped that the new policy had the "highest political backing". Another advantage would be scaling up skill development in open source.

Microsoft to invest Rs 1,400 crore in India cloud data centres

(“The biggest cloud data…)
BENGALURU: Seeing a $2 trillion promise in India's cloud market, Microsoft has decided to spend Rs 1,400 crore on setting up three data centres in the country. In a filing with the Registrar of Companies, the US software giant said it has started work on setting up the cloud data centres in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai. The company is setting up local centres in a bid to capture the India market, especially customers in the banking and telecom industries, which have had data sovereignty concerns.
For Microsoft, which earned Rs 2,261 crore from India in 2013-14, the country is among the fastestgrowing cloud markets globally, with 2,000 customer additions each month. The company hopes to scale up its cloud offerings by setting up more global data centres.
"The biggest cloud data centres we have globally are capable of handling 600,000 servers in just one region. That's a massive amount of compute. Increasing this scale helps us in being more competitive," Corporate Vice President for Microsoft Azure Jason Zanders told ET.
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said during his visit to the country in September that he sees the India cloud computing market as a $2 trillion market opportunity.
Top cloud players have shown keen interest in setting up data centres in India in the past few months. IBM launched a centre in Mumbai this month and plans to add another one soon. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had indicated in September that the company could set up its centres in India. The situation was quite the opposite about a year ago when all major companies shied away from India, citing infrastructural issues such as unpredictable power supply, patchy Internet connectivity, limited bandwidth and unreliable optical fibre connectivity.
"There is a huge demand for cloud services in India, especially among the SMBs (small and medium sized businesses) because of which companies like Microsoft are willing to spend so much on setting up data centres in India," said Sanchit Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research. However, seeing high growth in cloud adoption in India, companies are working out ways to overcome such issues. IBM has set up multiple sets of power equipment and signed up multiple bandwidth providers to increase reliability for its Mumbai data centre.
Microsoft is in talks with telecom companies to connect large enterprises directly to their data centres, which will ensure faster and more reliable bandwidth. According to Gartner, the public cloud services market in India is expected to grow from $423 million Rs 2,550 crore) in 2013 to $1.3 billion in 2017. Gartner expects India to be the fastestgrowing market for cloud adoption globally.

IT services industry should look at doing new things: Vishal SikkaCeBIT India 2014
(Sikka, who has the ardent…)
BENGALURU: Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka , who has the ardent task of reviving the company, today criticised the Indian IT industry's business practice of "doing old things cheaper" and said firms should innovate more.
"As I speak to you it is my 100th day as the CEO of Infosys. I was not deeply familiar with the services industry until recently. As I had thought about the opportunities in front of us and the current state of Infosys, I see a tale of two cities," Sikka said.
In his recorded key note address through video at CeBIT India 2014 here, he said, "I find that on the one hand we have a great opportunity in front of us to help accelerate the reshaping of world with software. But at the same time, I also see the reality that we are currently in - that is a somewhat depressing reality."
"I find all of us in the industry find ourselves on a downward spiral. It's like a treadmill of increasingly lower cost, hiring people faster and faster from more and more mediocre places, training people less and less, putting them into job faster and faster. I think that is a wrong direction," he added.
Sikka, the first outsider who has not been part of the co-founder's club to lead the Bangalore-based firm, became the CEO of the company earlier this year at a time when fortunes of once-IT-bellwether were down and rivals were doing relatively better. He has come from US-based SAP.
CeBIT India, billed as world's largest business IT and ICT event, is being held in association with Bangalore ITE.biz, India's flagship ICT event of Karnataka Government.
Stating that there is a better direction Sikka said, "I think we can do better than that. I think that we can be partners of our clients not only Infosys, but all of us in the industry, to be strategically relevant to them."
"To work with them on the challenges that they face not only on lowering costs, labour arbitrage and staff augmentation. They are depressing ideas. I think we can do better than that,"
Sikka said, "We can be much greater strategic partners to our clients on the basis of innovation, intelligence, automation and techniques, instead of looking at doing old things cheaper, we should look at doing new things."
Sikka is part of the business delegation that is accompanying Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his three nation tour to Myanmar, Australia and Fiji that is on currently.

Modi government to expand UPA’s corporate job scheme in Jammu & Kashmir
Aman Sharma, ET Bureau Nov 13, 2014, 04.00AM IST
(Home minister Rajnath Singh…)
NEW DELHI: The Centre is planning to expand the 'Udaan' scheme initiated by the previous UPA government to rope in prominent companies to recruit youths from Jammu & Kashmir, as part of a new J&K policy to be unveiled early next year after the assembly elections in the state.
Home minister Rajnath Singh has suggested an improvement to the scheme, which involves taking companies beyond Srinagar to other towns and even remote locations in the state for organising employment camps and hiring locals, officials said. The government will pay local people salaries to bring unemployed graduates to the placement camps to make a success of this initiative, they added.
After the disruption due to severe floods, a group of companies is set to visit the state on November 17 to resume recruitments, a home ministry official said. The scheme has already helped provide jobs to 1,785 youths from J&K with companies including Accenture, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, the official added.
"Nearly 5,300 J&K youth are presently under training with various corporates. We now want to expand reach of the scheme to smaller towns and remote areas of J&K for which a plan is being made and will be unveiled after the state elections," the official told ET on condition of anonymity.
An assessment of the scheme by the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, which took over in May, has shown that youths from cities like Jammu and Srinagar are averse to taking up corporate jobs in metros as the initial remuneration is just Rs 15,000-20,000 per month.
"These youths seem to be finding the salary package not enough. We are trying to work with the corporates to increase the salary. But the thought is also that a graduate in a remote town or village of J&K would perhaps see such a salary level of Rs 20,000 a month as attractive and hence can be tapped," the official said.
More than 54 companies have already committed to train nearly 68,738 graduates and post-graduates in J&K over the next four-five years and later offer them jobs as well if they fit the bill. The cost of the training, boarding and lodging, is borne by the central government. If a candidate is selected for a job after completing training, the government reimburses the training cost to the company.
The official added a number of other companies have recently tied up with the Centre to train youths in J&K over the next few years. These include Bharti Infratel Limited; TENVIC, a division of Anil Kumble Sports Promotion; Fidelis Corporate Solutions; MTC Mount Talent Consulting; and Manpower Group, the world leader in innovative work solutions.
YES Bank, Religare and public sector units including NTPC, BSNL, ONGC, HAL and BHEL are also among the companies that have committed to train J&K youths for corporate jobs in metros.

Preparing for worst case scenario: CRPF on Jammu and Kashmir pollsCentral Reserve Police Force
(CRPF Director Gen Dilip…)
NEW DELHI: Central forces deployed to provide security during the forthcoming assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir are being prepared to tackle the "worst" kind of crisis or attacks, the chief of country's largest paramilitary CRPF said here today.
Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Director General Dilip Trivedi , however, ruled out the possibility of any "big" incident happening in the state during the five-phase polls scheduled to begin on November 25.
"As far as our task is concerned, we are taking no chances. We have asked our troops to be prepared for the worst case scenario. My view is that we do not anticipate any big thing (disruptive activity like attacks) during the polls," Trivedi told reporters here on the eve of the forces' 75th Raising Day.
Trivedi added that despite this analysis they were not taking away the fact that there may be "very high-level attempts" to disturb the polls in Jammu and Kashmir.
The DG, whose force is the nodal agency for deployment of all central forces in Jammu and Kashmir, said the Assembly polls in 2002 when the PDP came to power, was a "watershed".
"We recently conducted both assembly and general elections in Chhattisgarh and I don't think the forthcoming J&K polls are as tough as this Left Wing Extremism-hit area," he said.
The force has close to 60 battalions (about 60,000 personnel) in the interiors of Jammu and Kashmir for security duties and in view of the upcoming polls, the central government has sent in a total of 381 companies of various central forces including BSF, ITBP, CISF and state police reserve units to the state for poll-related duties. The CRPF has the largest numbers in this pool with 111 companies.
One company of these paramilitary forces has close to 100 personnel.

Uber to invest $400 million in India to grow businessUber to invest $400 million in India to grow business, expand and hire

BENGALURU: Taxi hailing app Uber could set aside nearly half the amount from a proposed round of funding to grow business in India, its largest and fastest growing market outside of the US. "Uber could invest over $400 million in India," said two people familiar with developments. "It is likely to use the cash to strengthen presence where it has a footprint, expand to newer cities and to aggressively hire," said one source.
According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Uber has informed its investors that it plans to raise more than $1 billion in funding which is likely to value the company at more than $30 billion.
Uber did not reply to email queries from ET on the developments. The Indian taxi aggregation space has been the hub of frenetic action in recent months, with companies like Ola, Taxi-ForSure and Uber, competing fiercely for market share . In October, Japan's Softbank led a $210-million funding round in Ola.
Experts are of the view that for Uber, India is an attractive market for the sheer scope that it offers for future growth. "The density footprint in Delhi or Bangalore is not even comparable to its fleet in say New York city. There is plenty of room for Uber to expand," said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at the Stern School of Business in New York whose research is focused on digital economics.
"In India there is a rapidly growing middle class and a lack of good infrastructure, so it makes a lot of sense for a company like Uber to take the market seriously."
The Indian taxi market is estimated to be worth about $9 billion (Rs 54,000 crore), of which only 4-6% is organised. There are around 2.3 million taxis registered in India.
"The aggressive money flow can be attributed to the fact that transport companies only need to leverage technology to reorganise an existing market," said Kartik Hosanagar, professor of ecommerce at The Wharton School, "This is often faster and more cost-efficient than creating new markets,' he said. Companies like Ola and Uber do not operate their own taxis but provide the technology platform that links taxi owners and operators with passengers.
Uber launched its Indian operations in September 2013. Since then it has expanded its network to include more than 15,000 drivers in ten cities including Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi. The company is looking to hire more than 30 officials in India, according to its website, including government relations senior associate, and a strategic finance manager. Earlier this week, Uber also announced that it has partnered with financial services firms and automobile manufacturers to launch a vehicle financing program for Indian cab drivers.
Uber is backed by Goldman Sachs and Google Ventures, among others, and is reported to have clocked over $1 billion in gross bookings world over last year, with revenue estimated to be doubling every six months. The company is present in over 200 cities in the world.

Uber to integrate Paytms digital wallet into its payment systemUber to integrate Paytm’s digital wallet into its payment system

(Uber which until now,…)
NEW DELHI: Ride-hailing company Uber has partnered with Noida-based digital payments provider Paytm to offer Indian consumers a choice on how they will pay for a ride in an Uber cab, a move aimed at meeting directives laid down by the country's central bank.
Uber which until now, stored credit card details to automatically charge a consumer once the taxi ride is over, will integrate Paytm's digital wallet into its payment system.
"Customers can now pay with multiple systems including debit cards, credit cards and net banking,' said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and managing director of Paytm. The exclusive tie-up, will go live on Thursday.
"India has been growing faster than any other market for Uber outside the US," Allen Penn, head of Asia operations told ET, confirming the partnership.
"With the Paytm tie-up more than 600 million people who have bank accounts and net banking, will be able to enjoy the seamless and cashless experience that credit card users experience with Uber. It's a fully in-app wallet customised experience, which is a great example of the importance of the Indian market ," Penn added.
Paytm's Sharma said, "Consumers will sign into the Paytm wallet" after booking a taxi on the Uber app. "There will be no separate Uber payment system, and the transaction will happen from the Paytm wallet," he said.
The partnership, a first- of- itskind for the San Francisco-based company, comes two months after the Reserve Bank of India mandated that online payments between two Indian 'residents' cannot bypass a two-factor authentication process.
While the RBI clarified policy around payments, it emphasised that transactions must be carried out in the local currency, and not US dollars. This has prompted taxi services aggregator Uber to overhaul its existing payment methodology.
Uber's original payment mechanism follows a system where it stores credit card details of passengers and automatically charges the card once the taxi ride is over without two-factor authentication, as it uses an international payment gateway.
In the new system, existing Uber users will be asked to sign into the Uber app again where they will be prompted to sign into the Paytm wallet as a two-step process, which will be the norm for all new customers.
Consumers will also be given the option to physically load their digital wallets with cash, at select points. Paytm, is currently in the process of identifying the points.
"You can load your Paytm wallet by going to a couple of places that we have identified by the end of November, these could be retailers and certain points such as airports," said Sharma.
One97 Communications-owned Paytm will become the sole payment mechanism for Indian customers who want to use services of Uber. While Sharma refused to disclose the exact details of the revenue sharing agreement between the parties, it is understood that Paytm will receive proceeds of about 2.5% from every transaction recorded by Uber.
Last month, ET was the first to report that the mobile transportation company was in talks with Paytm and PayU.
International Data Corporation adds that with more than 80 million smartphones expected to be sold by the year end, India is among the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world.

HCL Techs engineering unit may earn over $1 billion in FY16GH Rao president
(HCL Tech’s engineering…)
MUMBAI: The engineering and R&D division of HCL Technologies will likely cross the $1-billion mark in the next financial year as the company sees larger deals in a market that's widely expected to be the next big source of growth for the Indian IT sector. HCL Tech's engineering services unit contributed about 17% to the company's revenue in the September quarter, coming in at $245 million. The unit grew about 8.1% sequentially in the quarter.
"Earlier, scaling the accounts took a few years because clients would start out with small projects or give us parts of the product development. But now customers are starting to outsource bigger projects and we are seeing a trend where we can get work on an end-to-end product," GH Rao, president, engineering and R&D services, HCL, told ET.
HCL has outstripped rivals such as Tata Consultancy Services in revenue in this division. However, experts say that given how revenue is classified with the division, such as those accruing to product lifecycle management and technical publications, Wipro is also near the billiondollar mark in this business.
The unit has about 19,000 engineers, giving it scale in a sector that is expected to power future growth. And, unlike the IT industry, which has complained for years about the quality of graduates, ER&D has a strong supply from engineering colleges in India.
"It's a misconception that R&D requires specialised people. Our engineering colleges are training people in electronic and mechanical engineering. These students are wellsuited to the roles," Rao said. He added, however, that there was a little shortage at the more experienced levels but that, too, was beginning to get better.
India's ER&D services market is expected to reach $38 billion by 2020, according to research firm Zinnov , growing at about 12% a year over the period.

NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday identified high cost of capital, the country's labour regime and infrastructure deficit as "special areas" that the government will address "very soon" to bring down prices of manufactured goods and raise the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25% from 15%. He also called for an aggressive approach to boost services exports.
"I still find in merchandise products, our cost of capital or labour regime, our infrastructure, the improvements which are required in our trade facilitation...these still have to be assisted in order to bring down the prices of our manufactured products," Jaitley said while addressing a services conclave organised by the commerce department and industry lobby CII. "As part of Make in India campaign, these are special areas which we will have to address and address very soon.
We are in the process of doing so." Jaitley, who is also the Minister for information & broadcasting and corporate affairs, said India's services sector has huge growth prospects but the country needs to change its approach to unlock its potential.
"There are areas where we need to be aggressive. If we are on the defensive in services, even large number of professional services, people are now devising means to defy those bans. So, where direct offices are not allowed, indirect hubs are coming up," he said in an indirect reference to resistance from professional bodies to opening up of legal and accountancy services.
The services sector contributes about 60% to the country's gross domestic product. The minister said there is a need to seize the initiative in this sector and become a world backroom supplier of services, just as some other countries have become for manufacturing.
"Our success in IT and IT-enabled services is well known... Several US presidents have tried to impose restrictive regimes on outsourced services to save jobs in the US. But that, indirectly translated in simple language, means you are compelling the US consumers to buy costlier services from within their own country when the same service is available almost in same real time at a fraction of that cost outside. These rules have substantially not succeeded," he said.
The minister said India is beginning to make an impact in the pharma sector, adding that healthcare, research & development, tourism and education are the other sunrise sectors that have growth potential. "The manufacturing sector has partly shrunk and unable to absorb the underemployment in agriculture. Services is an area where we cannot afford to be defensive," Jaitley said.
Addressing the conclave, Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher said India's $151 billion worth of services exports make up only 3.3% of global exports. He said IT-ITes dominate services exports from the country and there is a need to expand the export basket to push other services like healthcare and tourism.

(FSLRC report has pitched…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to expedite the revamp of financial sector rules as recommended by the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) after the matter is said to have been flagged by the President.
The Prime Minister's Office has sought a status report from the finance ministry on the implementation of FSLRC recommendations after their tardy implementation was brought to the attention of Modi by President Pranab Mukherjee early October, a few days ahead of the bureaucratic reshuffle that saw Rajiv Mehrishi replacing Arvind Mayaram as finance secretary , said a government official aware of the deliberations.
The perceived delay is said to be among the reasons for the change in personnel. The FSLRC report pitched for a complete overhaul of the financial sector, governed by as many as 60 Acts and multiple rules and regulations. Some of these, such as the RBI Act and the Insurance Act, date back to the 1930s when many of the financial products available today couldn't have been conceived of. Similarly, today's derivatives market didn't exist in 1956, when the Securities Contract Regulation Act was enacted.
The finance ministry is understood to have sent a detailed response to the PMO on implementation milestones after having received the report.
As finance minister, Mukherjee had announced the government's intent to set up the FSLRC in the 2010-11 budget. The commission was notified in March 2011 . The panel submitted its report on March 22, 2013.
It suggested a uniform Indian Financial Code and the creation of a Unified Financial Agency to subsume the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority , the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority and the Forward Markets Commission, besides the establishment of an independent debt management office and a Resolution Corporation apart from providing a statutory framework for a Financial Sector Development Council.
P Chidambaram , who succeeded Mukherjee as finance minister, placed the report in the public domain for feedback while regulators were asked to move ahead with the non-legislative reform agenda. Those items that needed parliamentary approval were left to the new government.
The Modi administration has expressed its support for the changes proposed with the PM being very keen on replacing or doing away with obsolete laws in all sectors."There are some important recommendations of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission like the enactment of the Indian Financial Code awhich is considered necessary for better governance. It will be my endeavor to complete the ongoing process of consultations with all the stakeholders expeditiously on this," finance minister Arun Jaitley said in his July budget speech.

Why impressive numbers dont mean much to Jan DhanAgent
(Banks are giving Narendra…)
The aggregate numbers are designed to impress — 6.99 crore accounts have already been opened since PM Narendra Modi launched Jan Dhan Yojana on Independence Day, according to pmjdy.gov.in, a government website. But several concerns lie hidden beneath those numbers.
Under pressure, the department of financial services gave hard targets to banks, which in turn, transmitted the pressure to local staff and banking correspondents (BCs, agents who represent a bank on the field). "The pressure was so high that I told my staff to disregard norms on opening accounts only for the unbanked," admits the head of a Delhi-based banking correspondent company.
On the consumer side, the overdraft offered under JDY, the insurance policies bundled with it, and the fear of missing out on direct benefit transfers incentivised customers to open accounts.
However, the quality of the accounts opened is open to question. "Opening of multiple accounts has happened in an absolutely blatant manner," says the head of the BC company. Agrees Manoj Sharma, the MD of the Asia Pacific operations of Microsave, a financial inclusion think tank: "The question is whether these are first accounts or second accounts." Such duplicate accounts, a finance ministry official says, are now being weeded out.
This is not the first financial inclusion drive that India has seen. In 2009, the Reserve Bank of India directed banks to ensure banking access in all 348,000 villages with a population of above 1,000 by March 2013. This was followed by Swabhimaan — an overlapping financial inclusion drive launched by UPA2 in 2011 as a prelude to a shift to cash transfers.
Two problems that dogged these drives are likely to haunt JDY as well. It's not enough to open an account; people also need easy and reliable access to the bank. Then, once they get access to the bank, they need relevant financial products.
Right now, the banks and the government are working in a mission mode. But the questions will come once the accounts are opened," Says Kabir Kumar, a microfinance specialist at Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). "How do you design the insurance and pensions such that they are useful for the poor?"
Last Mile Access
Banks are planning to add BCs to deal with the spike in account-holders instead of adding branches. However, India's experience with BCs has not been good. In erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) payments through BCs were so late that the state government had to bring in an ordinance threatening penalties. "Banks, BC companies and village agents withhold the money meant for payments and pensions, earning interest off the float or rotating money in the local market, instead of paying it out quickly," says Sowmya Kidambi, the director of SSAAT, the social audit arm of the state rural development ministry.
Pratap Mandvi, a 40-something farmer in the predominantly Gond village of Madhogarh, about 70 km to the south of Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, is sceptical about BCs. He says villagers will worry the BC agent might vanish with their money. Villagers in Madhogarh say the Central Bank of India branch at Narayanganj has told them to visit only on Mondays. But it cannot process more than 100-150 people in a day.
"And so, the rest are told to come next Monday. But if I need money today, what will I do?" asked one villager.
  A bank official at the local Gramin bank, the sarpanch of a neighbouring village, and other villagers at Madhogarh confirm Mandvi's claim about restricted access, though employees at the local Central Bank of India denied any such restriction.
Open and Sleep
In financial inclusion circles, the poor response to previous FI drives has been misinterpreted as the need to educate villagers about the importance of saving — an explanation which fails to explain why rural India is seeing informal savings schemes like chit funds grow even as zero balance accounts lie dormant.
Take Madhogarh. Most people in this village of about 2,500 people already have bank accounts — almost entirely due to NREGA. However, very few save in the banks at Narayanganj, about 10 km away.
Instead, in recent years, a lot of villagers have invested in get-richquick schemes, ponzis, and companies which promise land in return for fixed payments and lost money. Says Mandvi: "The bank is the uchit sadhan (correct means) for saving money. But accessing that is hard — especially for poorer villagers."
Such ponzi schemes, says S Ananth, a Hyderabad-based rural finance researcher, are common in unbanked — or poorly banked — areas. The rise of such ponzi schemes — in one of the poorer parts of the country — illustrates both the latent demand for financial inclusion and the costs of it not being delivered.
That is the context that JDY has to operate in. But is it set up to deliver better outcomes than previous financial inclusion drives?

RBI chief Rajan expects final norms on small banks by month-endRBI to invite payment bank applications by month-end: Raghuram Rajan
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 02.12PM IST
(Addressing micro-financiers…)
MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank by month-end will invite applications for setting up small finance and payment banks, which will cater to low-income households and small businesses, after putting in place final norms in this regard.
These banks are expected to bring in a large chunk of the public, especially in rural areas and other places with low penetration, into the formal banking system.
"We visualise mobile companies, companies with large rural presence, may be shops, may be kiosks, as well as possibly the post offices seeking payment bank licences," RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said.
"In the weeks to come, we would put out the final guidelines on payment banks. The guidelines are currently with the government for comments. I am hopeful that by the end of the month we will call applications for both small finance and payment banks," he said at a micro finance conclave, organised by the Nabard here.
Deepening the financial inclusion was one of the five items of agenda Rajan had set for himself after he took over last year.
The central bank had earlier awarded universal banking licences to infra lender IDFC and micro lender Bandhan. The two new licences were issued after a gap of 12 years.
One of the suggestions from the industry on the draft guidelines on small banks, Rajan said, is allowing all-India small finance banks instead local area ones.
But, the governor said, if at all the proposal was accepted, they will be allowed to take only deposits and extend loans predominantly to small entities.
Stating that the small bank licence would offer avenue for successful micro-finance institutions to migrate to banking licence without it affecting their core business of working with small and the excluded, Rajan said a decision on this has to come from the government.
Small finance banks would provide a whole suite of basic banking products such as deposits and supply of credit, but in a limited area of operations.
Payment banks would offer a limited range of products such as demand deposits and remittances. They would have a widespread network of access points particularly in remote areas, either through their own branch network or through business correspondents or through networks provided by others.

SRINAGAR: Notwithstanding massive preparations to achieve its Mission Kashmir , the BJP is facing a crisis within. BJP has denied tickets to seven of its 10 members in the assembly, and some of them have now turned against the party. In the past few days, two of its sitting MLAs defected to other parties while another is contesting independently.
Basholi MLA Jagdish Raj Sapolia joined Congress after BJP named Choudhary Lal Singh its candidate for the seat. Singh, a former Congress minister and two-time MP, moved to the saffron party after Congress denied him a ticket this time. Sapolia's counterpart in Hira Nagar, Durga Dass, joined the Panthers Party. Master Lal Chand , who was representing Bani in the assembly, is contesting independently.
Reports from Jammu suggest that its Reasi representative Baldev Raj Sharma is seeking mandate from the People's Democratic Party . In case he fails to get a ticket, he might contest as independent. Girdhari Lal Baghat, who was initially tipped to be the BJP candidate from Ramban, was denied the ticket at the last moment. He joined the National Conference.
The BJP is facing crisis in Udhampur, Billawar, Khour and Akhnoor, too. In some constituencies, party cadres are against "thrusting" non-local candidates when local talent is available. The situation has led the party to send senior leaders to pacify the disgruntled lot. Some of them have been promised berths in the legislative council once the elections are over. They include Raipur Damana MLA Bharat Bushan.

Exclusive: Dreamliner fleet helps Air India pare nightmare lossesInfosys founders, including Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
Air India has significantly improved its operating performance on the loss-making routes that were bleeding the airline financially.
As on October 31, around 69% of Air India’s total routes now cover their variable cost, across both domestic and international routes. Variable costs for the airline include fuel costs, landing fees, catering charges, crew expenses, salaries and maintenance cost. Air India operated 400 flights daily to 50 Indian and 33 international destinations.
As on December 31, only 40% of Air India’s routes were covering their variable costs. The airline is targeting to increase this proportion to 81% by the end of fiscal 2015, according to an Air India official.
For the six months ended September 30, Air India posted a 10.7% year-on-year increase in passenger revenues to R7,415 crore, the company official said.
The Air India executive said the carrier had seen passenger traffic strengthen significantly across loss-making routes, including those connecting India with Australia, Thailand and Italy.
Air India, which was losing about R70 lakh per day in May 2014 on the Delhi-Sydney-Melbourne route with a low passenger load factor (PLF) of around 50%, registered a PLF of 72% and generated a surplus of R3 crore on this route in October.
On the Delhi-Rome-Milan-route, where Air India registered a PLF of only 50% till September, the airline could cover its costs in October by registering a PLF of 67% in October. “We hope to achieve a load factor of 75% on this route by early 2015 on the back of an enhanced marketing campaign, including across social networking sites,” the Air India executive said.
Air India’s flights to Thailand, which is among the better performing international sectors for the airline, also witnessed an increase in PLF due to the introduction of Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft on this route.
The carrier’s flights to Bangkok registered a PLF of 72% in October, up from 60-65% in the few preceding months.
With Air India’s fleet of Dreamliners delivering positive results for the company, the airline has also replaced its fleet of Airbus aircraft on the Delhi-Singapore route with the bigger Dreamliners to compete with Singapore Airlines, which introduced the superjumbo Airbus 380 in April.
“We have been able to maintain a 70% load factor after introducing Dreamliners on the Delhi-Singapore route despite having competition from Singapore Airlines and other airlines,” the Air India executive said.
AI’s fleet of Dreamliners is helping the carrier utilise its aircraft better.
“The Dreamliners have been giving us an 89% on-schedule performance,” the official said. “The average utilisation of the Dreamliner aircraft currently stands at 13.9 hours per day in October, up from 12.8 hours per day in August. With the arrival of the 17th Dreamliner aircraft on December 7, we hope to further boost our operations.”
On the domestic front, Air India is managing to recover variable costs across 89% of its routes, as of October, after introducing the more fuel-efficient Dreamliners and Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft to connect major metros in the country.
On international routes where the carrier is still unable to recover costs at least, Air India plans to cut down the frequency of flights after a review by the company’s board of directors scheduled for March 2015. Some of these routes include Ahmedabad-Mumbai-New York, Mumbai-Delhi-New York, Ahmedabad-Mumbai-London, Hyderabad-Delhi-Chicago and Mumbai-Delhi-Shanghai.
Route cause:
Air India has seen increased passenger load factor (PLF) on international routes
Airline covering fixed costs on 69% of its routes now, compared with 40% as on Dec 31
Delhi-Sydney-Melbourne route, which was losing money, earned R3 crore surplus in October
PLF on Delhi-Sydney-Melbourne route improved to 72% vs 50% earlier
PLF on Delhi-Rome-Milan route at 67% vs 50% earlier
Passenger revenues at R7,415 crore for the six months ended Oct 31, up 10.7% y-o-y

B-School placements set to rock; e-comm tops...Amazon
(“The students are rooting…)
MUMBAI: Recruiters heading for campus placements will find the batch of 2015 free of the usual jitters. Placement cells of more than 11 top B-schools point out this may be the best placement season in the past few years.
Factors such as bigger pay packets, more job offers and companies waking up from a hiring freeze have resulted in students displaying a larger risk appetite and testing the market for recruitments despite pre-placement offers (PPOs) in hand.
Placement cells of IIM Indore, XLRI, MDI Gurgaon, NMIMS,IIM Calcutta and IIM Lucknow have found students in larger-than-expected groups, wanting to join the e-commerce and startup industry. "E-commerce is the most buzzing sector on campus," says Prabudh Jain, student placement coordinator, MDI, Gurgaon. Agrees Suvarna Athavale, external relations secretary, IIM Calcutta , "E-commerce is growing rapidly in India, and many students are interested especially because of its unique challenges. Students are also expecting to bag more offers than before."
Banking and consulting, the traditional favourities, are still popular on campus, especially when it comes to strategy consulting roles from the likes of McKinsey & Co, BCG, Bain & Co and the like.
An earlier indication of the popularity of ecommerce was revealed during the 'ET Top Recruiters in B-School' survey when, for the first time, e-commerce recruiters such as Flipkart and Amazon joined the top 10 rankings, alongside traditional recruiters such as Cognizant , ICICI Bank and Deloitte, which have consistently been making it to the top 10 over the past few years.
At Mumbai-based NMIMS, the placement team is trying to double the number of startups they got last year to placate one-fourth of the batch who want to join these new-age firms. NMIMS has 450 students to place and had five start-ups hiring from their campus, last year.
"The students are rooting for smaller companies that are below the radar like Salt n Soap, and not just larger ones like Flipkart and Amazon," says the chairperson , placements of one of the top B-schools who does not wish to be named. Students believe opportunities to learn may be more in smaller firms. Besides, the large number of deals in the startup phase has boosted their confidence, adds the chairperson.
Arpit M (name changed), an IIM Bangalore final year student has a PPO like many in his batch. However, most of his classmates, despite their PPOs, will sit for interviews again during final placements. "In any other year, a PPO would have sealed our decision, but those trying their luck this time despite PPOs could be higher," he says.
Student placement committee member, Mahima Sushil of IMI Delhi, says, "It's still early days but we are expecting a good number of first-time recruiters as well." Deferred placements may also increase because more students want to start their own ventures, in an economy that whets the risktaking appetite. Around 20 graduates from the Class of 2014 across the six older IIMs alone had opted out of cushy corporate jobs to launch their own ventures.
Rajiv Mishra, chairperson, placements at XLRI has already seen a couple of students discussing deferred placements. XLRI has 180 students to place. Usually, a few students opt for deferred placements, but this year could see more doing so. B-schools offer deferred placements to top students who want to start their own businesses but in case of a failed attempt, get help from their alma mater for another shot at recruitment.
Indications are that companies may shell out more for their choice of candidates. A placement cell member at one of the newer IIMs, IIM Rohtak, says that freshers are expecting anywhere between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 16 lakh per annum. "This, despite the fact that average work experience for this batch is about 14 months as compared to three years last time. For the batch of 2014, the average salary was at Rs 9.72 lakh," he says. "The season has begun with a bang," says Jain from MDI Gurgaon. "It's still early days, but as compared to last year when the average salary was at Rs 14.74 lakh, we are expecting around or above Rs 16 lakh."
Although students are treading with caution, some positivity from the summers has rubbed off on the students of IIM Bangalore. "During summer placements, firms made more offers and if that happens again during finals, it will change the game," says Sapna Agarwal, head, Career Development Services of IIM Bangalore. Summer placements ended in record time for most B-schools, and many companies across campuses had to be declined.
At XIM, Bhubaneswar, feelers have been sent from IT firms and FMCG companies that had not hired in the past four years, for IT system profile and roles in marketing.
At IIM Lucknow, PE firms and investment banks are returning with more profiles, says Pushpendra Priyadarshi, chairperson, placement. "The batch of 2015 has also shown signs of being selective about their roles and plans to wait for the right offer than accept the first one," says a student placement cell member of IIM Indore.

Brent edges above $78  still near 4-year low...Baghdad
(Brent front-month crude…)
SINGAPORE: Brent crude edged above $78 a barrel on Friday but remained close to a four-year low because of concern over excess supply and uncertainty over whether oil cartel OPEC would cut production at a meeting in two weeks.
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi appeared to rule out a cut in output but other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are pushing for action to tackle the fall in prices when delegates meet in Vienna on Nov. 27. Oil prices have plunged 30 per cent since June.
Brent has fallen for eight weeks in a row, its longest weekly losing streak since records began in 1988, based on Reuters data. It has lost nearly 7 per cent so far this week.
"We've got a period of very heightened volatility in the lead-up to the November 27 OPEC meeting," said Mark Keenan, head of commodities research in Asia at Societe Generale in Singapore .
Brent front-month crude futures rose to $78.10 a barrel as of 0317 GMT after the December forward contract expired on Thursday, when it settled down $2.46 at $77.92, a level not seen since September 2010. It had touched an intra-day low of $77.83.
US crude for December delivery climbed 20 cents to $74.41 a barrel after closing down $2.97, or 3.9 per cent, in the previous session.
"It was a pretty steep fall. One wouldn't be surprised by a market bounce in thin Asian markets," Keenan said.
Adding to oil glut worries, crude stocks at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub climbed by a larger-than-expected 1.7 million barrels last week, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.
But US crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell 1.7 million barrels in the week to Nov. 7, against analysts' expectations of a 750,000 barrel build in inventories, the EIA said.
The market was also keeping an eye on wider geopolitical issues.
The 120,000 barrel-a-day Hariga oil port in eastern Libya has reopened after state security guards ended a protest over unpaid wages, a port source said on Thursday, but the El Sharara oil field remains shut.
Iraqi and Kurdish officials have agreed to a deal over oil exports and civil service payments, which should ease tension between Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government, Iraq's finance minister said on Thursday.

Snapdeal logs onto rural India; plans 5K e-c..."I am going into this thinking that we will be able to reach 5-10 crore new consumers in the next three years," Kunal Bahl, co-founder and CEO of Snapdeal, told TOI. At present, Snapdeal has around 3 crore registered users.

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Online retail is poised for a hyper jump into rural India. To go one up on archrival Flipkart, Snapdeal - one of the country's largest e-tailers - plans to tap 50 lakh low-income households in slums and villages across the country. These include places such as Dharavi (Mumbai), which is Asia's largest slum, Govindpuri, one of the biggest slums in Delhi, and villages in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana, among many others.
Snapdeal will launch around 5,000 e-commerce kiosks across 65 cities and 70,000 rural areas by the end of next year with the help of FINO PayTech , an Indian financial inclusion solutions company. These e-commerce centers will be manned by village-level entrepreneurs, have personal computers and tablets, and also serve as collection and delivery points of packages since most people living in these areas usually have no permanent addresses. Additionally, they will help consumers with zero internet connectivity to shop online.
"I am going into this thinking that we will be able to reach 5-10 crore new consumers in the next three years," Kunal Bahl , co-founder and CEO of Snapdeal, told TOI. At present, Snapdeal has around 3 crore registered users.
Interestingly, initial pilot runs by these kiosks have revealed that the average ticket size of purchases by rural consumers is not too far behind that of urban consumers. "It is Rs 1,400 compared to Rs 2,000 from urban areas," said Bahl.
Snapdeal will be offering a special assortment of utility-cum-aspirational products, such as speakers, juicers, solar lanterns, diner sets, cameras and mobile phones. These products will be curated on an exclusive page that will require login by a FINO agent, who would place an order, collect payment, receive and deliver to people who have no permanent address.
"This channel has great potential. For instance, we call people from Dharavi the HNIs (high net worth individual) of slums," said Rishi Gupta, executive director and COO of FINO PayTech.

PM Modi sees Aadhaar benefit for BJP | Takes governance tips from Malaysian PMPM Narendra Modi sees advantage for BJP government from UID scheme Aadhaar

(Aadhaar will help the government…)
NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's belief that his party would gain politically in UP and Bihar assembly polls if central beneficiary schemes are rolled out using Aadhaar, has prompted him to strongly pitch for the UID scheme he had attacked until a few months ago. The Centre has been prompted to set a target of enrolling all Indians by next March also because of its growing realisation that Aadhaar's biometric features were a deterrence for terrorists and that it would help Modi's ambitious 'Digital India' plan.
ET spoke to multiple officials in the government, home ministry, UIDAI and IB to decipher the BJP government's new-found love for Aadhaar, since it was a scheme that BJP leaders had threatened to scrap during their poll campaign. Officials are racing towards completing a target what seemed only a dream a few months back — of enrolling all 30 crore people in UP and Bihar in just about a year.
"Crucial polls are there in Bihar in mid-2015 and in UP in early-2016. Aadhaar will help the government roll out it schemes like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and Direct Benefits Transfer effectively.
Both these states have a history of swindling central grants," a top government official told ET. Ironically, BJP is cashing in on a UPA decision in February to hand over these two key states to UIDAI for enrolment after the MHA's National Population Register scheme had only succeeded in enrolling less than 10% of the population in UP and Bihar. The Modi-led Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs endorsed UPA's decision in September. "Aadhaar enrolments, since March, have covered 8 crore people in UP and Bihar. We are enrolling 15 lakh people every day and hope to cover both states totally by March," a UIDAI official said.
UIDAI has enrolled over 70 crore, covering 90% of population in Delhi and Andhra while NPR has captured only 26 crore people. The subsequent change in heart has been at the home ministry. "Why would a terrorist give his finger-prints, IRIS print and get himself live photographed to get an Aadhaar card? Last week the terror mastermind of the Burdwan plot was arrested, Sajid.
He had all conceivable fake identity documents — a Voter I-Card, PAN Card and Driving License but not an Aadhaar card," a senior MHA official told ET. The mnistry is also impressed by the e-KYC process wherein a person gives his finger-prints on a biometric kiosk which instantly flashes his Aadhaar details.

Bug in Apple s iOS software: US governmentApple
(The US government warned…)
The US government warned iPhone and iPad users on Thursday to be on the alert for hackers who may exploit a vulnerability in Apple Inc's iOS operating system that would enable them to steal sensitive data.
There was the potential for hacks using a newly identified technique known as the " Masque Attack ," the government said in an online bulletin from the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center and the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Teams.
The network security company, FireEye Inc, disclosed the vulnerability behind the "Masque Attack" earlier this week, saying it had been exploited to launch a campaign dubbed "WireLurker" and that more attacks could follow.
Hackers could potentially steal login credentials, access sensitive data stored on iOS devices and remotely monitor activity on those devices, the government said.
Such attacks could be avoided if iPad and iPhone users only installed apps from Apple's App Store or from their own organizations, it said.
"We designed OS X and iOS with built-in security safeguards to help protect customers and warn them before installing potentially malicious software. We're not aware of any customers that have actually been affected by this attack," Apple said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
Users should not click "Install" from pop-ups when surfing the web. If iOS flashes a warning that says "Untrusted App Developer," users should click on "Don't Trust" and immediately uninstall the app, the bulletin said.

Modi Oz visit: Overseas Indians in Australia seek dualcitizenshipPrint

By: Press Trust of India | Melbourne | Posted: November 14, 2014 11:12 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 11:13 am
Coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Australia visit, the Indian community here has launched an online campaign, appealing to him to grant dual citizenship to overseas Indians.
“It’s time that Indian government grants NRIs dual citizenship,” the campaign’s spokesperson and President of Indian Australian Association of New South Wales Yadu Singh said.
He claimed that the campaign which had just started in Australia was already gaining traction in the Indian community.
“It is gaining momentum and it will get enthusiastic support from Indian diaspora all over the world, particularly United States of America, Canada, the UK and Australia. It will continue to be run until India sees merits in granting dual citizenship,” Singh said.
“There are an estimated 25 million non-resident Indians (NRIs), people of Indian origin (PIOs) and overseas citizens of India (OCIs) spread across more than 200 countries. Cumulatively, they contributed about USD 70 billion in remittances to India in 2013-14,” Singh said.
“The recent changes in the PIO and OCI cards announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi are welcome, but they do not meet the long-term demand of dual citizenship by overseas Indians,” he said, adding that “the overseas citizenship card (OCC) falls well short of genuine dual citizenship.”
Singh said almost over 900 people have already signed the online petition and shown their support for the campaign.
He recalled that the promise of dual citizenship was made by the former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in 2003 and since then there have been statements from senior politicians about them favouring dual citizenship.
The petition has also sought granting Indian passports to overseas citizens of Indian heritage with full political and economic rights, granting of convenient voting rights to such dual passport-holding overseas Indians as well as overseas Indians with Indian passports (NRIs), which can be exercised either at the consulate, high commission or embassy premises in their country of residence and through postal or online facilities.

Within hours of landing in Brisbane  Narendra Modi visits QueenslandUniversityPrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Australia.
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | Brisbane | Posted: November 14, 2014 11:40 am | Updated: November 15, 2014 1:01 am
Within hours of landing in Brisbane for the two-day Group of 20 Leaders Summit starting Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped out to the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), to interact with scientists in agriculture and bio sciences.
“The Prime Minister was given a demonstration of specific scientific projects, some of which are jointly funded by Australia and India,” said Prof Arun Sharma, Deputy Vice Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation), QUT.
After a presentation on AgBot, a special robot that has agricultural applications, Modi wrote on it that research is the mother of development and intrinsically linked to the development journey of mankind. He also spoke to students and said he was fortunate to meet them on the 125th birth anniversary of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Modi interacted with QUT academicians to know more about India-Australia joint projects such as bio fortification of banana, integrated bio fuel project and robotics in agriculture. Congratulating the scientists at QUT, he said, “Agriculture will benefit from the use of science and technology.”
 
 
Prof Sharma said Queensland has a very special relationship with Modi. “Queensland was one of the first jurisdictions in the world to send an invitation to Mr Modi when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2012. There is a quite a lot of investment coming from Gujarat,” he pointed out.
The research on nutritional enrichment of bananas with iron is funded by the Australian government, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the department of biotechnology, India.
“He also saw our research in pulses, and how we covert waste material from agriculture or sugar waste into plastics, chemicals and bio fuel to create more value added industrial products. This is so relevant to India which is also looking at adding more rural jobs,” Deputy V-C Sharma said after the PM’s visit.
According to Prof Sharma, who is a computer science undergraduate from BITS Pilani, and a Ph.D from the State University of New York, “There is a new sense of energy, vibrancy in India. And I think, Australia is aware of it. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in India and signed the uranium deal and also extended the Australia-India strategic research fund collaboration project.”
The two countries have much to offer to each other, he said. “We are in some sense complementary. India has know how and manpower. Australia has natural resources and expertise in infrastructure. It is not just resources. We have similar climatic zones.
The way we do agriculture and even build infrastructure is similar. We have a lot more to collaborate,” he added.
In Brisbane, where Modi arrived a little later than schedule, he was received by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman. The Prime Minister and his delegation are staying at the Sofitel Hotel in the central business district. “Reached Brisbane. It is bright and sunny outside,” Modi tweeted upon his arrival.

Islamic State releases audio of chief Baghdadi after deathrumoursIslamic State jihadist group chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
By: Agence-France Presse | Baghdad | Posted: November 14, 2014 11:25 am
The Islamic State group has released a defiant audio recording it said was of chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, after air strikes on jihadist leaders in Iraq sparked rumours he had been wounded or killed.
In the 17-minute message, the man purported to be Baghdadi vowed that IS, which has overrun swathes of Iraq and Syria, will continue to expand despite international air strikes, and that its opponents will be drawn into a ground war.
It is the first time that Washington has carried out air strikes in support of Sunni Arab tribal militia since it launched its air campaign in Iraq on August 8.
“Be assured, O Muslims, for your State is good and in the best condition. Its march will not stop and it will continue to expand,” said the man in the recording, whose voice sounded like Baghdadi’s but whose identity could not be independently
confirmed.
“Soon, the Jews and Crusaders will be forced to come down to the ground and send their ground forces to their deaths and destruction,” he said.
US President Barack Obama has announced plans to double the number of US military personnel in Iraq to up to 3,100 to help advise and train Baghdad’s forces – a move the man in the audio recording said was the start of the ground war between the two sides.
The message was the first said to be from Baghdadi since a video released in July, shortly after IS proclaimed a “caliphate” over parts of Iraq and Syria, of the jihadist leader delivering a Friday sermon in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
While the recording seemed aimed at dispelling speculation that Baghdadi was seriously injured or dead, it did not mention the strikes against IS leaders.
But it did reference the decision by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, Egypt’s deadliest militant group, to pledge allegiance to Baghdadi and IS, which was announced after the strikes.
The United States said that coalition aircraft launched strikes targeting IS leaders in the area of their northern hub of Mosul on Friday, setting off a flurry of speculation that Baghdadi was wounded or killed.
Some reports meanwhile pointed to another alleged strike near Iraq’s border with Syria, saying Baghdadi was hit there instead.
But officials in both Iraq and the United States have made clear that no one is yet certain about Baghdadi’s fate. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said Monday that “the bottom line from our perspective is we simply cannot confirm his current status”.
And senior Iraqi officials from the interior and defence ministries and the intelligence service said investigations were ongoing.

India s GDP to grow at 6.3% in  15: Morgan S...Asia Economist
(It is seen at Rs 62.5…)
SINGAPORE: India would have the fastest economic expansion among Asian countries and its gross domestic product is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent in 2015, according to Morgan Stanley forecasts of global economies.
The Indian rupee's exchange rate to USD would be at Rs 62.2 by end of next year compared to Rs 62 in the current quarter (Q4 this year), according to a presentation made at the Morgan Stanley's Annual Asia Pacific Summit held here from November 12-14 said.
It is seen at Rs 62.5 in the first two quarters of next year and Rs 62.3 in the third quarter of next year.
Comparative to other Asian GDP growths, India would have the fastest economic expansion, it said.
India's gross domestic product is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent in 2015, up from 5.3 this year, it said.
"We are constructive on the INR from the outlook perspective," Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley's Chief Asia Economist , told PTI.
Strong capital inflow and the current account deficit under-two per cent would add upward pressure on the Rupee. Reforms are providing confidence in the Indian economy growth.
The Indian government's policy action to improve business environment and lower oil prices are among the factors supporting the GDP growth, Ahya said.
Structural reforms related to land, labour and tax supporting the economic growth would support economic growths in the coming years. The risk would be any disruption to execution and delivery of reforms as well as a slowdown in exports, he pointed out.
On imports, the lower oil prices have been helpful and supporting the economic growth. Oil imports were down at 4 per cent of the GDP now from 6 per cent in 2012.
"It is obviously helping the recovery process," Ahya said.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley has forecasted a sub-par global growth at 3.5 per cent in 2015, up nominally from 3.1 per cent this year. In Asia, China's GDP is forecasted to contract to 7.1 per cent in 2015 from 7.3 per cent in 2014.
Asian GDP, excluding Japan's, would grow to 6.3 per cent in 2015, up by a small proportion from 6 per cent this year. Japan's GDP growth would be stagnant at 0.8 per cent in 2014 and 2015.
Some 1,700 delegates including representatives of 300 global corporations are attending the summit.

Facebook s privacy update: 5 things to knowbluetooth
(Facebook is once again trying…)
NEW YORK: Facebook is once again trying to simplify its privacy policy, largely to address criticisms that it's too complex and lengthy for the average user.
Laid out with illustrations into short subsections, the new policy explains what types of information Facebook collects and how it uses the data. The new policy is 70 per cent shorter than the old one.
Many of the changes are cosmetic, designed to make the policy easier to digest. Still, it helps to go through it to get an idea of all the things Facebook knows about you.
Users have until Nov. 20 to comment on the proposed changes or ask questions. A finalized version will take effect soon after that.
Here are five things to remember about Facebook's data policies.
LOCATION, LOCATION
Facebook only recently began allowing businesses to advertise to users based on their specific location. Previously, ads were targeted based on the ``current city'' listed on the profile. Both the old policy and the new one note that the company can access your location information based on your smartphone's GPS information. The new policy points out that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals can also reveal device locations.
Besides that, Facebook can also collect information from the photos you share on the site, including where they were taken.
BEYOND FACEBOOK
Facebook doesn't just track what you do on its site. It also collects information about your activities when you're off Facebook. For example, if you use Facebook to log in to outside websites and mobile apps, the company will receive data about those. It also gets information about your activity on other businesses it owns, such as WhatsApp and Instagram , in accordance with those services' privacy policies.
AD TARGETING
Unless you decline targeting, or opt out, companies whose websites you visit off Facebook can also show you ads on Facebook. For example, a website can use browser cookies to record who visited it. It can then ask Facebook to show ads to these visitors, both on and off Facebook.
ALL EYES ON YOU
Everything is fair game. Facebook explains it best: ``We collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others.'' Plus, Facebook says it also collects information about how you use Facebook, ``such as the types of content you view or engage with or the frequency and duration of your activities.''
SHOPPING SPREE?
Facebook is testing a tool to let people buy things directly through its site. If you decide to do this, Facebook will collect information about your transaction, including your credit card number and billing and shipping address.

Hundreds of millions of miles from Earth, a European spacecraft made history by successfully landing on the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - an audacious cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the origin of the universe.
The European Space Agency celebrated the cosmic achievement after sweating through a tense seven-hour countdown that began when the Philae lander dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe toward the comet as both hurtled through space at 66,000 kph.

Save precious time tracking your investments
DARMSTADT/GERMANY: Landing with a bounce after traveling 4 billion miles, a European spacecraft made history Wednesday by successfully reaching the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - a cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the universe.
The landing by the washing machine-sized craft after a decade-long journey required immense precision, as even the slightest error could have resulted in stellar calamity.
Indications were that the spacecraft touched down almost perfectly, save for an unplanned bounce, said Stephan Ulamec, head of the lander operation.
"Today we didn't just land once. We maybe even landed twice," he said with a chuckle.
Ulamec said thrusters that were meant to push the lander, called Philae, onto the surface, and harpoons that would have anchored it to the comet failed to deploy properly. Initial data from the spacecraft indicated that it lifted off again, turned and then came to rest.
Scientists were still trying to fully understand what happened and whether those failures would affect the lander's ability to remain on the comet, called 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . But so far, most of the instruments were working fine and sending back data as hoped, Ulamec said.

"Tomorrow morning we should know a lot more," he said.
The landing team at mission control in Darmstadt had to sweat through a tense seven-hour wait that began when Philae dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe as both it and the comet hurtled through space at 41,000 mph (66,000 kph).
During the lander's descent, scientists were powerless to do anything but watch, because its vast distance from Earth - more than 300 million miles - made it impossible to send instructions in real time.
Finally, at 16:03 GMT (11:03 a.m. EST), the agency received a signal that the lander had touched down.
While it may take a while to determine the exact state of the 220-pound (100-kilogram) lander, the fact that it was resting on the surface of the comet was already a huge success - the highlight of Rosetta's decade-long mission to study comets and learn more about the origins of these celestial bodies.
The head of the European Space Agency underlined Europe's pride in having achieved a unique first ahead of its U.S. counterpart, NASA.
"We are the first to have done that, and that will stay forever," said the European agency's director-general, Jean-Jacques Dordain.
NASA contributed three instruments to the mission and its Deep Space Network of giant radio antennas has been key to communicating with Rosetta.
Eight-time spacewalking astronaut John Grunsfeld, now associate administrator for science at NASA, called the landing "a breakthrough moment in the exploration of our solar system and a milestone for international cooperation."
"The data collected by Rosetta will provide the scientific community, and the world, with a treasure-trove of data," he said in a statement.
Scientists have likened the trillion or so comets in our solar system to time capsules that are virtually unchanged since the earliest moments of the universe.
"By studying one in enormous detail, we can hope to unlock the puzzle of all of the others," said Mark McCaughrean, a senior scientific adviser to the mission.
The insight gleaned will give researchers the opportunity to test the theory that comets brought organic matter and water to Earth billions of years ago, giving them a key role in the evolution of life on our planet, said Klim Churyumov, one of the two astronomers who discovered the comet in 1969.
Rosetta and Philae will accompany the 2 {-mile wide comet as it races past the sun and becomes increasingly active in the rising temperatures. Between them, they will use 21 different instruments to take 3D images, analyze the comet's chemical composition and electrical properties, and even probe its internal structure with low-frequency radio signals.
Mission manager Paolo Ferri said there was no time to celebrate, because the lander had only enough battery power to operate for up to 64 hours. After that it will have to recharge, using solar panels to eke out an extra hour of operations each day.
Ferri said communications with the lander also needed to be stabilized, as there were intermittent connection problems after the touchdown. In the meantime, all the data that Philae collects is safely being stored for later transmission, he said.
Rosetta, which was launched in 2004, had to slingshot three times around Earth and once around Mars before it could work up enough speed to chase down the comet, which it reached in August. Rosetta and the comet have been traveling in tandem ever since.

Hundreds of millions of miles from Earth, a European spacecraft made history by successfully landing on the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - an audacious cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the origin of the universe.
The European Space Agency celebrated the cosmic achievement after sweating through a tense seven-hour countdown that began when the Philae lander dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe toward the comet as both hurtled through space at 66,000 kph.

The agency then received a signal at 1603 GMT from the 100-kilogram Philae lander after it touched down on the icy surface of the comet named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Philae had drifted down to the comet and latched on using harpoons and ice screws.
"We definitely confirm that the lander is on the surface," said flight director Andrea Accomazzo.

(The 100-kilogramme (220-pound)…)
DARMSTADT, GERMANY: European scientists were hoping for a stream of data Thursday after a robot lab made the first-ever landing on a comet, a key step in a marathon mission to probe the mysteries of space.
Operation chiefs in Darmstadt, Germany, on Wednesday said the lander Philae failed to anchor to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on landing, but still managed to send back scientific information.
The 100-kilogramme (220-pound) explorer may have plopped down in a soft, sand-like material or may be lightly touching the surface, they speculated.
More would be known on Thursday when Philae makes scheduled contact with its mothership, Rosetta, landing manager Stephan Ulamec said.
"Hopefully, we are sitting there on the surface at a position different to the original landing and can continue our science," Ulamec said.
The agency was to brief the press at 1300 GMT. The European Space Agency (ESA) is ecstatic at the operation and NASA -- the world's most successful space agency and an expert at difficult landings -- itself heaped praise on the exploit.
Equipped with 10 instruments, Philae was designed to carry out the first-ever scientific experiments on a comet, providing the jewel in a crown of a massively complicated project more than two decades in the making.
Getting from Earth to a comet that is travelling towards the Sun at 18 kilometres per second (11 miles per second) was a landmark in space engineering and celestial mathematics.
The 1.3-billion-euro ($1.6-billion) Rosetta mission was approved in 1993.
Rosetta, carrying Philae, was hoisted into space in 2004, and took more than a decade to reach its target in August this year, having used the gravitational pull of Earth and Mars as slingshots to build up speed.
The pair covered 6.5 billion kilometres together before Wednesday's separation prior to landing.
Seen by the superstitious as harbingers of good or evil, comets are viewed by astrophysicists as time capsules of the nascent Solar System.
They comprise ancient ice and dust, the rubble of the material that went into the making of the planets 4.6 billion years ago.
According to one hypothesis, they may have given Earth the gift of life by pounding it with ice that made the oceans and carbon molecules that provided the building blocks of organisms.
Philae was designed to come into land at a gentle 3.5 kilometres per hour, then fire two harpoons into a surface that engineers hoped would provide sufficient grip while the robot conducts its experiments.
However there were indications that these landing harpoons had failed to deploy, ground control said.
Envisaged tests include drilling through the comet surface and analysing the samples for chemical signatures.
In Toulouse, France, astrophysicist Philippe Gaudon, who heads the Rosetta mission at French space agency CNES, said it would be difficult for Philae to drill if it was not secured.
"However, Philae has not tipped over and seems to be stabilising," Gaudon said.
"And a certain number of instruments are continuing to operate, mainly for measuring temperature, vibration, magnetism and so on."
Philae is designed to operate for about 60 hours on a stored battery charge, but several months more if it can get replenishment from sunlight.
The lander complements 11 instruments aboard Rosetta, a three-tonne orbiter that is doing four-fifths of the expected scientific programme from orbit.
Whatever happens to Philae, Rosetta will continue to escort the comet as it loops around the Sun.
On August 13, 2015, "67P" will come within 186 million kilometres of the star.
The mission is scheduled to end in December 2015, when the comet heads out of the inner Solar System.
At this point, Rosetta will once again come close to Earth's orbit, more than 4,000 days after launch.

(The final decision on the…)
NEW DELHI: A National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) team tasked with recommending a revenue neutral level for the goods and services tax (GST) has suggested as many as 16 rates, corresponding to different scenarios.
The final decision on the tax rate will be taken by the GST Council, to be constituted after the passage of a Constitutional Amendment Bill, said two government officials familiar with the deliberations on the issue. A constitutional amendment bull to introduce GST, introduced by the previous government, proposes the creation of a GST Council consisting of the union finance minister , state finance ministers, and the minister of state for revenue.
Apanel of state government ministers, known as the empowered committee, has tasked a sub-committee, consisting of central and state government officials, with devising the GST tax rate. The subcommittee is processing the NIPFP report in order to arrive at a revenue-neutral rate, the tax percentage at which there is no loss to the centre and the states after the switch to the new regime.
"There are as many as 16 scenarios in the report. These include a three rate GST, four rate GST, two rate GST, subsuming and excluding different taxes such as entry tax and central sales tax as also items such as petroleum, sugar and textiles," said an official adding that the report has been sent back by the sub-committee to NIPFP for reworking it as per latest revenue numbers available for 2012-13 or 2013-14.
This is the second report by NIPFP on the matter. It had carried out a study last year as well. The rates suggested in the latest study are 14%, 16%, 20%, 24% and 27%, marginally different from the numbers thrown by the previous one. "The empowered committee (of state government finance ministers) did not discuss the report or the rates at the meeting on Tuesday." the official said.The revenue neutral rate indicated by NIPFP in both its reports is based on tax collections in 2011-12.
At present, services are taxed by the Centre at the rate of 12% (plus cesses), goods at a standard rate of 12% (plus cesses) and concessional rate of 6%.
States have concessional rate ranging from 4-6% and standard rate ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%. There are other levies such as central sales tax, levied at the rate of 2%, that applies on sale of goods from one state to another and entry tax. The combined incidence of tax including excise, VAT and CST comes to 26.5%-28.5%.
The figure of 27% is at the midpoint of this range and a number of media reports said this had been accepted by the sub -committee of officials working on the revenue neutral rate. In a press release issued on Wednesday, industry body FICCI said a 27% rate will cripple trade and industry.
The general thinking is to have a separate rate of 1% or lower for bullion , a list of exempted items, a concessional rate and a standard rate. The GST council will decide on rates depending on the structure accepted by states and Centre and elements brought within the ambit of the GST.
Tax experts are pitching for a unified rate—identical for services and goods but also a reasonable rate for taxation of services to ensure compliance.

GST dream one step closer to reality; empowered panel of state FMs & Centre agree on 'place of supply' rules

(Prime Minister Narendra…)
NEW DELHI: The government's bid to implement the goods & services tax (GST) as early as possible got a significant boost with the empowered committee of state finance ministers endorsing the so-called 'place of supply' rules that form the backbone of the new regime that will replace a plethora of levies, create a common market and likely give GDP growth a lift of up to two percentage points. The states are also confident GST will be in place by April 1, 2016, six years after it was originally scheduled to take effect.
The place of supply rules decide where goods or services will be taxed, fixing a crucial element of the levy that has gained in importance because of the surge in ecommerce and electronic delivery of services. Meanwhile, the Centre is preparing the ground for a national common market commission that will mesh with GST to create a unified area without interstate barriers to trade. However, both the Centre and the states continue to differ on the threshold for the levy with the first wanting it to be raised to Rs 25 lakh while the latter prefers it at Rs 10 lakh.
The Centre has assured the states that they won't suffer any revenue loss on account of subsuming petroleum product and entry taxes within the ambit of GST, promising to meet an important concern of states that are opposed to these duties being included in the levy that was to have been rolled out in April 2010.
"The empowered committee has given in-principle clearance to place of supply rules... This is a key takeaway from today's meeting," a senior government official, aware of the panel's deliberations on Tuesday, told ET.
Tax experts see finalisation of these rules as key to GST. "Place of supply rules are fundamental in determining the state where a service is provided and state GST or integrated GST is required to be paid," said Bipin Sapra, partner, EY. "These are extremely crucial to the basic structure of GST." Place of supply and consumption will determine the tax-recipient state and consuming state and have implications for their revenue.
"Place of supply rules are very critical for GST to run effectively. This is more so in the context of services as determining the state of consumption would be challenging, particularly where the services are not provided from an identified fixed place, such as telecom and transportation," said Pratik Jain, partner, KPMG in India. Jain pointed out that most of the disputes on value added tax in the European Union centre around place of supply rules.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has identified GST as one of the most important items on the government's crowded reforms agenda and progress on the talks is being closely monitored.
The government is expected to finalise the draft of the constitutional amendment Bill that will allow the Centre to tax goods at retail level and states to tax services in a few days. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has already indicated the Centre is in the last stage of finalising the Bill draft, approval of which is an essential step in the process. "If all goes well and the constitutional amendment Bill is carried in Parliament by both Houses, I think the 2016 target date is achievable," said GST Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather.
The empowered panel did not agree to the Centre's demand for a higher threshold for taxing goods and services.
"In September, the Centre wrote to us suggesting that this decision of the empowered committee should be reviewed. The Centre suggested that the limit should beRs25 lakh. Even if it is not Rs25 lakh, the Rs10 lakh limit should be increased," Rather said, adding that the committee wants to stick to the agreed Rs 10 lakh threshold. However, he said the final call on threshold could be taken by the GST Council proposed to be created in the constitution amendment Bill.
GST will subsume central indirect taxes such as excise duty and service tax at the central level and value added tax at the state level besides other local levies such as octroi and entry tax. Though states are reluctant to include entry tax within GST, the Centre is now attempting to persuade them by offering a revenue compensation mechanism. The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, has lapsed and the government has to come up with fresh legislation.

Government looking at more ideas to enhance services exports: Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher

(The Department of Commerce…)
NEW DELHI: Emphasising on the need to become more competitive in services in the global market, government today said it is looking at 'more ideas' in the forthcoming foreign trade policy so as to increase exports.
"What we are trying to do is to make it (SFIS) more effective and also come with some more ideas on services exports," Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher told reporters here.
The Department of Commerce is working on ways to expand the scope of the 'Serve for India Scheme' (SFIS) in the new five-year foreign trade policy.
Under the scheme, duty credit scrips equivalent to 10 per cent of foreign exchange earned are given to exporters. It aims to facilitate exporters of various types of services.
"There is a need for us to become more competitive, widen our scope and identify areas where new technologies and new processes of delivering services are promoted," he said at Services Conclave 2014, organised by Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Confederation of Indian Industry.
India is considered as a 'mind' for services delivery but its share in the global services exports is still below 3.5 per cent as against European Union's 42 per cent and China's over 4 per cent.
"We need to look at what kind of domestic reforms are required to make us competitive in the international market... huge amount of domestic reforms are required... reforms which are required range from very small rule amendments to significant changes," he said.
He added that the Indian industry should focus on Mode II (in the territory of one member to the service consumer of any other member) and Mode III services (like legal and accountancy).
Kher further said that in WTO, few members are negotiating an agreement on trade in services.
"In 2005, we gave our revised offer to WTO. Unfortunately, the WTO is also in some kind of limbo. In the meanwhile, a plurilateral trade in services agreement is being negotiated. We have not been able to participate in that process.
"That is a good enough challenge for us to prepare ourselves to be able to participate in a much broader exercise in the WTO itself and create an environment for other developing countries to come and participate in a much more (broader way)," he said.
Speaking at the same event, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said huge untapped potential exists in several services sectors in India such as healthcare, tourism, entertainment and hospitality.
The government is committed to provide every kind of support for the growth of the sector, she said.
The sector contributes about 57 per cent to the country's GDP. In 2013-14, the services exports stood at $ 151 billion.

Global financial services provider JPMorgan has said India's liquidity is expected to go into its normal state of deficit from current surplus.
The government would cut spending to meet fiscal deficit target, JPMorgan said, adding that it would also build back its cash balances.
A report by the financial services major on Thursday said the government's deficit would preclude any large open market operation sale.
The future liquidity management by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be mainly through forex forward interventions, it added.
The report also said overall banking system liquidity deficit will average Rs 50,000 crore ($8.12 billion) through the rest of 2014-15.
JPMorgan said the overnight call will thus trade at close to repo rate.

A day before SC hearing on chit fund scam  Orissa pledges logistical support to CBI  ED teamPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: November 13, 2014 9:25 pm
A day before the Supreme Court hears the prayers of senior advocate Shyam Divan, the Amicus Curiae in the multi crore chit fund scam, seeking court monitoring of the probe, the Orissa government on Thursday asked the director general of police to provide all necessary logistical support and documents to CBI’s local office and ED’s sub-zonal office in Bhubaneswar.
On November 5, Divan had filed a a 10-page application before the SC Bench headed Justice T S Thakur & Justice R Vanumati, complaining that the Orissa government was not at all cooperating in the court directed CBI and ED investigation and wanted the apex court to monitor the tardy probe. In his prayer, Divan had stated that Orissa giving any document to Enforcement Directorate even after several reminders from the agency  as well as a letter from from vice chairman of SIT on black money, Justice Arjit Pasayat. Divan also mentioned that the CBI SIT on chit fund in Bhubaneswar is facing acute shortage of manpower and was finding it difficult to probe all the 44 chit fund companies.
The SC bench fixed the hearing to November 14.
With the prospect of SC coming down heavily on the Orissa government, the home department today asked the DGP to provide all logistical support to ED and CBI on an urgent basis. Two days ago, the home department had directed the DGP and other government departments to immediately provide sweepers, furnitures and 3-phase electric lines to the local CBI office. On Wednesday, the Cuttack Municipal Corporation too handed over several important documents related to Seashore group. The ED which is looking into the instances of money laundering by some of the chit fund companies including Artha Tatwa and Seashore, in September had complained to the Orissa chief secretary about Bhubaneswar police commissionerate not handing over the documents relating to Artha Tatwa chit fund group.
Divan complained that CBI had only one SP, one Dy SP & three inspectors to probe all the chit fund companies. CBI had asked the state government to depute 10 inspectors, 20 constables and 8 vehicles for SIT, but got only one inspector and two vehicles.
Meanwhile, a special CBI court in Bhubaneswar on Thursday sent former BJD MLA Pravat Tripathy, Mumbai-based model Preeti Bhatia, builder Vineet Lalani and former state Congress secretary Dilip Mohanty to judicial custody till November 26 after their bail applications were rejected. Tripathy was arrested by the CBI on October 31, on charges of hatching a criminal conspiracy wth chit fund group Artha Tatwa and allegation that he had received huge sum from the group. After the end of his 13-day remand by CBI, he was produced before the special CBI court this morning.
Preeti Bhatia was arrested by CBI on October 10 over her alleged links with chit fund group Artha Tatwa and its chief Pradeep Sethy. Money from Artha Tatwa were allegedly transferred to her company bank account, personal account and relatives’ accounts without any valid reason.

GST  insurance bill on the way  says finance minister Arun JaitleyGST, insurance bill on the way, says Arun Jaitley
Gaurav Choudhury , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 14, 2014
First Published: 01:18 IST(14/11/2014) | Last Updated: 12:05 IST(14/11/2014)
The government is readying a raft of big economic measures in the coming weeks, including higher foreign investment ceiling in insurance and steps to roll out a nationwide goods and services tax (GST), finance minister Arun Jaitley said Thursday.

“We will have the insurance bill, and we will have the coal ordinance. Hopefully, these will be passed (in Parliament’s winter session). I also intend to introduce the Constitution amendment bill to introduce the goods and services tax,” Jaitley told Hindustan Times in an exclusive interview .
“We are in the process of discussing possible changes in the land acquisition law and therefore, nobody has said it will come in the winter session,” he added.
 
The minister also took a dig at his predecessor P Chidambaram, who recently said he felt let down that Jaitley had not repealed the retrospective tax law despite having a clear majority in Parliament.
 
“Some people become bolder when they are out of office. That seems to be the case with my predecessor. I am quite surprised at the stance of a UPA finance minister who says undoing what the UPA did is economic reforms. To the extent we could cushion the Indian economy against the dangers of retrospective tax, I have already done,” he said.

Mkts closely track Dolly Khanna s portfolio for her  magic picksAmara Raja Batteries
(Most of these stocks —…)
ET Intelligence Group: Every bull market produces stars — those who churn one multi-bagger after another. One such name which is being closely tracked by avid market watchers, and participants these days, is Dolly Khanna.
With stakes of more than 1% in 14 listed companies, Khanna's shareholdings are worth at least a few hundred crores. Most of these stocks — mainly small-caps — have multiplied several times, earning her a devoted fan following on Dalal Street in recent years. But, there is one thing that flummoxes them: they don't know who Dolly Khanna is.
That is strange because such impressive stock pickings usually spark frenzied hero worship, especially among those who prefer to piggyback rather than identify their own winners to make big money.
The only time her name pops up is when she buys more than 1% or more in a company. No one knows how she looks though traders' blogs have some versions of her identity. But, those market watchers who insist on knowing more about the thoughts behind picking the stock winners, could benefit better by talking to her husband, Rajiv. The low-profile investor revealed to ET that Dolly Khanna is a homemaker and that he manages her investments.
For Chennai-based Khanna, stock investing is more of a hobby than a profession. The Khannas own Kwality Milk Foods, which sold its ice-cream business to Hindustan Unilever in 1995. With the money he got after selling the ice cream business, Rajiv Khanna, 67, started investing in the market in 1996-97 for the first time.
"It started as a hobby and remains a hobby. My core business is of milk products," said the lowprofile investor, who agreed to talk to ET over phone after weeks of persuasion. He did not respond to requests seeking an interview in person. Hawkins Cookers was his first multi-bagger. Khanna started accumulating the stock in 2007 and went on accumulating it till June 2009 at an average price of 130-140. Today, the stock is trading at Rs 3,400, and the company has given at least 70% of its profits as dividends.
Then, there was nothing stopping Khanna. He went on to identify small-cap winners such as Wimplast (more than 7 times in two years), Cera Sanitaryware (more than 7 times in two years ), RS Software (4 times in less than two years), and Avanti Feeds (more than 4 times in less than 6 months). Khanna's passion for picking stocks through extensive research can be traced back to his first job. A chemical engineer from IIT Madras, Khanna worked for ICI Ltd, a pharmaceutical company as a research person in the field of industrial explosives and blasting physics. In 1986, he started his company - Kwality Milk Foods. In the first decade of his investing career, gains from the market were modest. It was only after 2007 that the stakes started becoming bigger.
Dolly Khanna's portfolio (companies in which she holds more than 1%) has grown from Rs 1 crore in 2007 to Rs 175 crore at present. She also holds shares in several other companies but that does not appear in the shareholding of those companies. "We also have holdings in larger companies but we can't buy more than 1% of them," he said.
  Khanna has held most of the stocks in his portfolio for a long time now but he has also played the momentum game. For instance, he had purchased 1% stake in Amara Raja Batteries worth Rs 13 crore in the June quarter of 2012 and sold the entire stake in less than six months for Rs 39 crore, making three times the profit. "I am just somebody who got lucky. People just see the profits we make, nobody knows the kind of hits we have taken."
Khanna's latest bets (bought in the last one year) include Premier Explosives, Mold-tek Packaging and Nilkamal. These stocks have at gained significantly from the time of the purchase. He declined to talk in detail about his investments. But, when asked about Nilkamal, a plastic product company and the only stock in which he increased his holding in the September quarter, Khanna said "Crude has started correcting. Let's see what happens." He claims he does not talk to company managements before buying a stock. "We purely rely on the public information and act on it."
ET spoke to top officials of three companies, including Liberty Shoes, Manjushree Technopak and Nilkamal, in which Khanna's holding is more than 1%.
The officials said they have not heard of Dolly Khanna. While the name is well-known on Dalal Street, few in the market know about Rajiv Khanna. "Although I have never got to meet them, I'vebeen hearing of them. They have been able to identify good companies at a very early stage and have made good money through investments," said a Chennaibased fund manager.
When asked about the investment strategy, Khanna said, "It all depends on the underlying market condition. Like in tennis you play different games on different courts — hard court, clay court and lawn, we also study the market situation and pick our stocks accordingly. It can be either a value stock, growth stock, momentum stock or buying based on technicals." He feels market is the most complex puzzle, "It's not the money, it's the challenge what is exciting. Money is just the outcome. And once you start to understand the game, making money is not difficult," he said.

Centre not to take lead in relaxing labour lawsFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The Centre is, at present, not planning to relax retrenchment norms for factories but will wait to see if other states follow in Rajasthan’s footsteps and amend the Industrial Disputes Act.
“Labour is in the concurrent list in the Constitution. Rajasthan government has taken the decision to amend the Industrial Disputes Act along with other labour law changes. We are not doing so right now but want to see if more states plan such amendments,” said Bandaru Dattatreya, newly appointed minister of state (independent charge) for labour and employment.
Since labour is in the concurrent list, states as well as Centre can make enact their own legislation on the subject.
Pointing out that every state is competitive for investments and development, Dattatreya indicated that more states could reform labour laws as “incentives”.
The Rajasthan government has last week received Presidential assent for amendments to three laws – the Factories Act, Industrial Disputes Act and Contract Labour Act. It has now become the first state in the country to allow companies with up to 300 people to retrench workers shut down operations without prior government approval. The provision was earlier only for those firms with 100 workers or less.
The Madhya Pradesh Cabinet, too, recently allowed such changes while Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have also been working on similar reforms.
While the Centre has also moved amendments to The Factories Act, 1948 and the Apprentices Act, 1961, Dattatreya, who took charge as labour minister on November 10, maintained that the NDA government is not anti-labour.
“We are taking many measures for labour welfare and we will encourage trade unionism. But industry has to survive and then only can workers prosper,” he told  The Indian Express, stressing that the amendments will ultimately help workers.

Sunanda case: Viscera samples to be sent abroad for testsComments
Delhi Police are considering sending the viscera samples of former Union minister Shashi Tharoor’s wife Sunanda Pushkar to a forensic laboratory abroad to determine the type of poison that might have caused her death.

The AIIMS medical board had, in its second report submitted to the police recently, confirmed that Pushkar had been killed by poison.
The, report, however did not mention the type of poison that caused Pushkar’s death.
They had suspected the use of some poison that had radioactive isotopes in it that labs in India couldn’t detect.
A senior police officer said the police were mulling sending the viscera samples to a UK-based laboratory that had facilities to test all kinds of poisons.
“It is almost clear that Pushkar died of poisoning. The biggest question now is what kind of poison was used and how did it reach her body. If these are answered, the case could head to its logical end,” the officer said on condition of anonymity.
For now, the police have asked the AIIMS panel of doctors to redo their investigations and name the poison that might have caused Pushkar’s death. But if the AIIMS team fails to do so, then the samples will be sent abroad.
The police have already seized three mobile phones and a laptop of Pushkar and sent them to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets after her death.
On Thursday, the police questioned some people related to the case but senior officials refused to divulge their identities.

At 10: 58 a.m., the stock was trading at Rs 86.6, down 2.42 per cent or Rs 2.15.

Watch out for common early signs of diabetesComments
Diabetes has a way of creeping up on you, with most people showing no symptoms at all. The few who do, almost never recognise them as red flags. The initial signs are usually so generalised that even doctors tend to miss them.
Almost half of India's population gets diagnosed when complications have set in, say experts, and advice everyone to get a simple blood sugar test by age 25. "Those who are obese, inactive and have a family history of diabetes should get it done each year starting at 18," says Dr Sujeet Jha, head, department of endocrinology at Max Super Speciality Saket, New Delhi.
Poorly-managed or untreated diabetes damages blood vessels and nerves and can lead to heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, pregnancy complications, amputations of limbs, and heart failure. Weak healing factor in patients leads to complications in diabetics who undergo surgery.
Among the common early signs of diabetes are:
Chronic fatigue: Diabetic patients cannot produce enough insulin absorb glucose from the blood. This starves the body of energy leaving them feeling fatigued and lethargic.
Tingling hands or feet: Prolonged exposure to high blood sugar damages nerve fibres throughout the body and interferes with their ability to transmit signals, causing tingling, numbness or burning pain in the hands or feet.
Bad breath, gum disease: Diabetes weakens the walls of the small blood vessels throughout the body, including in the gums, making them weak and prone to infection. Bacteria and fungi thrive in the mouth and infect the tongue, cheek and mouth, causing gum inflammation, dryness and bad breath.
Skin darkening, itchiness: Itchy or dry skin along with darkening and scaliness of the skin at the back of the neck, armpits and groin (acanthosis nigricans) may occur even in people who have insulin-resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes.
Blurry vision: High blood sugar changes the shape of the eye's lens, causing refractive problems such as blurry or distorted vision. It can also suddenly improve or deteriorate vision. Vision stabilises once the blood sugar levels is controlled.
Frequent urination: When blood sugar levels spike, the kidneys go on an overdrive to get rid of the excess sugar, forcing diabetics to pee often, sometimes several times during the night. This is followed by excessive thirst as the body tries to replenish fluids lost due to frequent toilet visits.
Bacterial and fungal infections: People with diabetes have low immunity and are more at risk of bacterial and fungal (candida) infections in the genitals and urinary-tract.

Saradha scam: No clue on how suspended TMC MP Kunal Ghosh got sedatives in jailComments
Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh, an accused in the multi-crore Saradha scam, took 26 sleeping pills in an alleged suicide bid inside the Kolkata jail where he has been locked up for the past year.
Kunal Ghosh, the CEO of the erstwhile media houses run by Saradha Group, had threatened suicide in front of a judge on Monday unless the influential people named in the scam were not arrested within 72 hours. (PTI Photo)
Ghosh, who was the CEO of Saradha’s media wing at the time the Ponzi scheme at the company unravelled, was rushed to hospital where doctors said his condition was stable.
The one-time close confidant of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had threatened this week to end his life if the CBI failed to take action against others involved in the scam.
Jail authorities filed an FIR against Ghosh as attempted suicide is a criminal offence.
"According to a complaint lodged by jail authorities, a case has been registered against Kunal Ghosh u/s section 309 of IPC," said Rajeev Mishra, joint commissioner (headquarters) of Kolkata Police.
A hospital official said Ghosh told doctors in the emergency department that he had consumed 26 pills.
“A six-member medical board has been formed to treat him. He is stable now. The team will decide when to discharge him,” said Pradip Mitra, director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research. “The contents of his stomach have been sent for forensic test.”
Prison officials failed to explain how the suspended Trinamool Congress leader managed to procure the sedatives despite being lodged in a high-security cell at the Presidency jail with two guards keeping watch.
“He was extremely depressed even during the last hearing (on Monday). We informed the court too. It is surprising how sedatives find their way inside the jail,” said Ghosh's lawyer, Soumyajit Raha.
Three letters were found in Ghosh's jail cell, sources said. One was addressed to the Chief Justice of India, another to the chief justice of the Calcutta High Court and the third to Saradha investors.
The chief minister suspended the jail superintendent as well as the doctor and nurse on duty while the state government set up a committee to probe the incident.
The incident triggered a torrent of questions from opposition leaders who said there could be a conspiracy to eliminate Ghosh by the real architects of the scam.
“If Kunal dies who will benefit? They will be senior Trinamool Congress leaders against whom he has been spilling the beans for a long time. People will take this incident as a conspiracy,” said senior state Congress leader Abdul Mannan.
The Saradha scam has turned into a major embarrassment for Trinamool chief Banerjee who has been accused by opposition parties of trying to shield some of the beneficiaries of the company’s slush funds.
The scam was caused by the collapse of an investment operation from the Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private firms that was running many unlicensed financial schemes in eastern India.
The group folded up in April last year, resulting in the loss of hundreds of crores to thousands of investors — largely from rural areas with little access to banking facilities.
During a court hearing in September, Ghosh said he was being unjustly kept behind bars while bigger beneficiaries of the scam were inaugurating community Durga Puja ceremonies.
Early on Friday, a guard deployed outside Ghosh’s cell saw the MP unconscious and informed jail officials. The local police were called and Ghosh was taken to hospital.

Worlds most wanted woman White Widow deadprint
Samantha Lewthwaite, dubbed 'White Widow', wrote an ode to the late al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden proclaiming her love for him
Samantha Lewthwaite or the White Widow has reportedly been gunned down in war-torn Ukraine by a Russian marksman.
According to The Mirror, Lewthwaite, the world’s most wanted woman terrorist,  had joined the Ukraine conflict just two weeks ago and was fighting on the side of a pro-government group, Aidar, as a sniper.
The Russian sniper who killed the British terrorist now has a bounty of $630,000 on his head from Ukrainian special services.
Muslim-convert Lewthwaite, who was married to London 7/7 suicide bomber Germaine Lindsay, had been on the run ever since she was linked to a failed plot to blow up hotels and a shopping centre in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2011.
The mum-of-four has reportedly been seen across Kenya and Somalia after allegedly becoming a top commander within al-Shabaab — the terror gang behind the Nairobi mall atrocity, when at least 67 people died in September last year.
Interpol made her world’s most wanted woman terrorist after her involvement in a Nairobi Mall attack.
Reports last month had said that she had joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and was one of its most prominent female fighters.
However, experts said the latest claims could be plausible if it was found Lewthwaite travelled to Ukraine to join radical Islamists fighting against Russia.
The White Widow’s dad, former British soldier Andrew Lewthwaite, 58, said at his house in Aylesbury, Bucks: “I have heard nothing. No one has told me anything. I’m not saying anything.”
Reports of her death came amid masses of propaganda from Moscow and Kiev over the Ukrainian crisis. And counter-terrorism expert Prof Anthony Glees said the claims could be a “diversion” by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In future  Delhi to Chennai in 6 hrs by trainIn future, Delhi to Chennai in 6 hrs by train
Srinand Jha , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 14, 2014

Railways minister Suresh Prabhu has fast-tracked plans to build the world’s second-longest high-speed rail corridor between Delhi and Chennai that will see trains running at speeds of 300km/hour, covering the 1,754-kilometre distance between the two cities in six hours.
The corridor is likely to cost Rs. 2 lakh crore and is proposed to be developed jointly with China, home to the world’s longest high-speed rail line between Beijing and Guangzhou.
A high-level Railways team will visit Beijing on November 24 to complete formalities with Chinese counterparts for the project’s feasibility study, ministry officials said.
The team – comprising officials of the High Speed Rail Corporation and the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited– will sign an agreement with the China Railway Siyuan Survey and Design Group.
“An Indian Railways team will visit China for training.  The study on the Delhi-Chennai line can be expected to begin early next year”, ministry officials said.
The exercise will be completed free of cost by the Chinese company, in line with terms of the September 18 Memorandum of Understanding signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in New Delhi.
The Delhi-Chennai corridor is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “diamond quadrilateral” project that aims to build a network of high-speed trains between different cities, including Delhi-Mumbai, Mumbai-Chennai, Chennai-Kolkata, Kolkata-Delhi and Mumbai-Kolkata. Shortly after taking charge on Monday, Prabhu took several decisions to expedite the PM’s pet project.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is currently conducting a feasibility study on the proposed Mumbai-Ahmedabad stretch, India’s first high-speed rail project.
India’s engagement with China in rail development began as recently as last month, when the Railways signed a pact with the China Rail Eryuan Engineering Group Company for ramping up speeds on the Mysore-Bangalore-Chennai line.

Madhya Pradesh: Two vice-presidents quit posts over ticketdistributionUjjain Premchand Guddu and Manak Agrawal
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:16 pm | Updated: November 15, 2014 2:13 am
Two more vice presidents of the Congress party resigned from their posts on Friday in protest against high handedness in distribution of tickets in the ensuing elections to municipal bodies in Madhya Pradesh.
The resignations of former Lok Sabha MP from Ujjain Premchand Guddu and senior leader from Bhind Govind Singh follow the resignation of another vice-president Manak Agrawal, who was unhappy with a section of leadership for the way tickets were distributed in Hoshangaba and Itarsi.
Guddu accused the party of fielding a candidate affiliated with the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in Ujjain while Singh alleged that the relative of a murder accused was fielded in Bhind.
An office-bearer of the Congress said local leaders could not reconcile themselves to the high command’s decision to field new candidates in the local body elections. The regional satraps are unhappy because they think they have not been given due importance as was the norm before.
Cabinet Minister and senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra compared the Congress with a sinking ship and the deserting leaders with rats. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for Congress-mukt Bharat will take effect in Madhya Pradesh,” he said.

Optimism on India has definitely picked up: ...Anshu Jain
(Sentiment plays a very important…)
In an interview with ET Now, Anshu Jain, co-CEO, Deutsche AG , shares his macroeconomic outlook and talks about the opportunities and challenges that urbanisation in India does throw up. Excerpts:
ET Now: Sentiment seems to be looking up, everybody wants to talk about India. Is India back on the radar? Is this optimism really justified?
Anshu Jain: Sentiment plays a very important role in economies. The mood and optimism on India have definitely picked up.
ET Now: How do we see India's optimism being played out from an outside perspective?
Anshu Jain: The view on India from outside the country, particularly from investors into India, has definitely turned around and in the last six months represents a new level of optimism towards the economy.
ET Now: Growth is slowly beginning to pick up, inflation has cooled off. Will India become an emerging market darling once again? We were on the radar, we slipped. Are we back on the radar as far as emerging markets are concerned?
Anshu Jain: Certainly, the short-term performance of the equity markets suggests so.
ET Now: Are equity markets running ahead of macroeconomic fundamentals?
Anshu Jain: They can sometimes. Time will tell whether that is true for India or not.
ET Now: I particularly want to talk to you about this reform thrust of the government. You come from one of the biggest bankers in the world. The question that one would want to ask you at this stage is, given the majority that this government had, are banking sector reforms something that should be high on their radar?
Anshu Jain: They are high on their radar. We had the fortune of the Finance Minister presenting to us at a conclave and he made it fairly clear that if India is going to fund its growth, then getting the banks back on track and making sure that their balance sheets are capable of expansion is one of his priorities.
ET Now: You are particularly here to discuss urbanisation in India and the challenges that it throws up. This government is very serious about it, it is talking about smart cities, it is talking about bullet trains. Something that has not really been said in the public space so much and because you are particularly speaking about this topic, if I may ask you, what are the opportunities and challenges that urbanisation in India does throw up?
Anshu Jain: Urbanisation would be the greatest opportunity and also one of the big challenges that India is going to face. It is an opportunity because in order to create wealth, it has been fairly demonstrable that as people moved from rural areas into cities, there is a wealth effect which takes place.
In India and China alone, 500 million people, that is twice the population of the United States, will move from rural areas into cities. The government is right to be very focused on urbanization, but equally large cities like the one we are standing in right now also have some tremendous challenges. So pulling together best practice is something which should be smart and the government is right to put it right at the top.
ET Now: What are of the best practices that India can learn from some of the most developed cities in the world?
Anshu Jain: Urban age is our attempt and we are trying to get not just lessons from the developed cities, but indeed a lot of the developing cities. We were in Rio, we were in Mexico City and the fact is that when you take these very large urban clusters, particularly in the developing world, there is a lot they can share with each other.

OECD sees G20 measures topping 2% growth targetOECD sees G20 measures topping 2 per cent global growth target

(Closing corporate tax loopholes…)
BRISBANE: The OECD said on Friday the plans of G20 nations to boost the world economy could beat their target of adding 2 percentage points to global growth by 2018, though geopolitical risks such as Ukraine and Ebola were mounting.
Angel Gurria, the secretary-general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, said that the more than 1,000 measures proposed since February would exceed the target, over the next five years, if implemented.
"Yes, if you take all the commitments and you assume they are going to execute impeccably, then ... it could take us beyond the 2 percent," Gurria told Reuters in Brisbane ahead of the G20 Leaders Summit.
In September, Joe Hockey, treasurer of G20 host Australia, said the total had reached 1.8 percent.
The OECD and International Monetary Fund measure and monitor national growth strategies that will be unveiled at the end of the G20 Leaders Summit on Sunday.
"We have run out of monetary policy room, we have run out of fiscal policy room. What is left is structural reform and this is a structural reform agenda as big as it gets," Gurria said.
The biggest risk to the global economy was an absence of reforms but other issues were mounting, he said.
"You now have some threats, geopolitical, the problems in Russia-Ukraine, the Middle East and now this Ebola is threatening...this is adding to already rather uncertain situation that we have."
The OECD and G20 are both pushing to crack down on tax evasion, a key objective for the Leaders summit.
Finance ministers and tax chiefs from 51 countries last month signed an agreement to automatically swap tax information in a bid to curb tax evasion via secret bank accounts.
Pascal Saint-Amans , director of the OECD's Center for Tax Policy and Administration, said a financial task force will deliver a commitment to G20 leaders to share information on multinational bank accounts from all financial centres except four: Panama, Cook Island, Vanuatu and Bahrain.
"Among them, Panama is the most significant financial centre," Saint-Amans said.
Gurria said that while much had been done to tackle tax evasion by individuals, more progress was needed on corporate tax.
"What about the multinationals? They're not paying taxes because they are using the legal structures we've created over 80 years to avoid double taxation and we have created perfect double non-taxation. We need to reverse that," he said.

Asian stocks slip ahead of Japan data... 
KELVIN CHAN | November 14, 2014 12:17 AM EST | Associated Press
HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mostly lower Friday as Japan's market paused ahead of economic data next week that could provide the pretext for a snap election to renew the government's mandate for its unprecedented stimulus program. Chinese markets were more restrained after days of strong gains in anticipation of wider investor access to the country's stocks on Monday.
KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.2 percent to 17,359.92 and South Korea's Kospi slid 0.8 percent to 1,945.44. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.1 percent to 24,038.23 while mainland China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.5 percent to 2,472.71. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,448.40.
STOCK LINK: The Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets were subdued ahead of the launch of a cross-border stock trading link on Monday that will allow investors direct access to each other's exchanges for the first time. The benchmarks made big gains earlier this week in anticipation that the link will draw new capital.
JAPAN ECONOMY:  Tokyo stocks held steady after a week of big gains as investors looked ahead to the Monday release of the latest quarterly GDP data for Asia's second largest economy. Japanese shares have been rising all week in hopes Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call a snap election to seek a stronger mandate for his economic stimulus program, and weak data may give him an excuse to do so.
WALL STREET: All three major U.S. benchmarks closed slightly higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2 percent to 17,652.79, its seventh record close in eight trading days. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose or less than a tenth of a percentage point, to 2,039.33. The Nasdaq composite rose or 0.1 percent, to 4,680.14.
CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 116.04 yen from 116.07 in late trading Thursday. The euro weakened to $1.2455 from $1.2466.
ENERGY: Oil prices bounced after hitting a four-year low. Benchmark U.S. crude added 13 cents to $74.34 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell $2.97 to close at $74.21 on Thursday. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, gained 61 cents to $78.10.

To address climate change, India has committed itself to a 20-25 per cent reduction in intensity of carbon emissions by 2020, but the international community will want more
U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have just signed a historic bilateral accord on climate change and clean energy cooperation in Beijing. This accord will have impacts in the run-up to the Paris Conference in December 2015 when the world community is expected to clinch a new agreement to combat global warming. The agreement was in the works no doubt, but it certainly came sooner than expected. Another agreement on trade in technology-intensive industries has been signed and this has great relevance for the World Trade Organization (WTO). With these two accords, the U.S. and China have signalled that they will influence multilateral outcomes through their bilateral agreements.
A historic accord
The accord is historic for a number of reasons. First, China has publicly announced that its emissions of carbon dioxide will peak by 2030 and that the intention is to have the peak year earlier. Second, China will increase the non-fossil fuel share (mainly nuclear, solar and wind) of all energy to around 20 per cent by 2030. Third, the U.S. will cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025 with an aspirational goal of an 80 per cent reduction by 2050. Fourth, the two countries will vastly expand cooperation in clean energy, phasing down of the use of hydrofluorocarbons in refrigerators and air-conditioners, demonstration of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies and climate-smart urbanisation.
The joint announcement recognises the special responsibilities that the two largest emitters have to curb their emissions. However, the statement understates their contribution to global warming. It acknowledges that “the U.S. and China account for over one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions” whereas the facts are that the U.S. and China account for around 15 per cent and 29 per cent respectively of global greenhouse gas emissions, making a total of about 44 per cent. China’s peaking year of 2030 means that it would peak at about 10 tonnes per capita (compared to the present level of around 7 tonnes per capita) while the U.S.’s per capita emissions then would probably be in the region of 15 tonnes.
“ India’s opposition to a concrete proposal for equity in greenhouse gas emission cuts put forward by the Africa Group has been an unwise stance. ”
China and the U.S. have been engaged at different levels over the past year at least to come up with such a joint announcement. The recent commitments of the 28-member European Union to deep cuts in their emissions by 2025 and 2030 has undoubtedly put a little extra pressure on China and the U.S. not to lag behind in demonstrating to the world that they recognise the onus is on them to do something dramatic. And to the credit of both, the Beijing announcement is indeed a landmark. It is a hugely important starting point, even with all the political upheavals that the U.S. has witnessed in the recent midterm elections.

Significance for India
What does this agreement mean for India? To be sure, India with about 6 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions is simply not in the same league as China, the U.S. or the EU. Even with 8 per cent economic growth over the next decade and a half, its share will not cross 10 per cent at most. Of course, in per capita terms India will be more advantageously placed simply because its population, already 1.24 billion, will increase by about 400 million over the next 35 years. But it would be extremely unwise to dismiss the significance of this agreement on the grounds that India is “different” because of the per capita argument. The international community will now expect India to make some firm commitments for 2025 and 2030. It has already committed itself to a 20-25 per cent reduction in emissions intensity (tonnes of carbon dioxide divided by dollars of GDP) below 2005 levels by 2020 and there should really be no problem to unveil plans for 2025 and 2030 as well. This would be in keeping with domestic imperatives as well.
The Planning Commission’s expert group on low carbon growth strategy had in its final report submitted in April 2014 projected that the contribution of solar, wind and biomass to electricity supply can realistically increase from the present 6 per cent to 18 per cent by 2030. Similarly, it had projected that nuclear energy (which does not entail emissions of carbon dioxide) could increase its share in our electricity supply portfolio from the current level of around 8 per cent by 2030. It is the government’s prerogative to do what it wants regarding the Planning Commission but it would be most unfortunate if this expert group’s report is ignored even without a discussion in the Union Cabinet or in the newly reconstituted National Council on Climate Change chaired by the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister has, on occasions, maintained continuity. His September 30th joint statement with Mr. Obama, for instance, has remarkably similar (at times even identical) language on climate change, energy and environment issues as the September 27th 2013 joint statement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Mr. Obama. Hence, it should not be difficult really for the Prime Minister to have the targets suggested by the expert group accepted as publicly stated objectives both domestically and internationally. The passage of a new and comprehensive law with specified goals would also add to India’s position as will demonstrable actions to ensure cleaner coal production and use actions which unfortunately have not been visible so far.
Balance of growth and ecology
The Sino-U.S. agreement does not automatically mean that the Paris Conference will yield something constructive that will meet political, economic and environmental objectives all at once. Paris will be more of a starting point rather than a final destination. But even for that starting point to be achieved, India has to start thinking creatively. It has long been a champion of equity in any international agreement but it has been opposing a concrete proposal put forward by the Africa Group in this regard. This has been a most unwise stance. In any case, equity gets reflected in the nature of mitigation responsibilities a country takes on — the fact that India is allowed to pledge reductions not in absolute levels of emissions but in relative levels measures of emission intensity is itself a reflection of equity considerations. India’s continued insistence on the Annex I (industrialised countries)/non-Annex I distinction that forms the bedrock of all climate change negotiations also needs to be relooked. Differentiation is essential but is this distinction made in a completely different era over two decades back still meaningful? Simply put, it is not.
Strong domestic actions are needed not just to strengthen our global standing but also to address growing public health and livelihood security concerns domestically. Rapid growth is imperative. But it needs to be sustainable as well. The current ruling dispensation seems to think that environmental and forest regulations and laws are a drag on economic growth. This is a profound misreading of the situation. In fact, in some cases, like in the case of emissions of sulphur dioxide and mercury, new concentration standards are required. To say that growth and ecology have to be integrated is fine in theory, but in practice there are choices to be made, complexities to be unravelled, contradictions to be understood and conflicts to be managed. There will be trade-offs and these have to be made public and transparent. The balance of growth and ecology calls for great nuancing and sensitivity which, alas, has not yet been in evidence.

Gold prices fell by Rs 90 to Rs 26,360 per 10 grams in the national capital on Thursday as demand for the yellow metal eased at existing levels amid a weak global trend.
Traders said apart from decreased demand from jewellers and retailers at prevailing levels, weak global cues and a strengthening dollar eroded appeal for the precious metal, mainly influencing sentiments in the domestic market.
Gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell by 0.5 per cent to US $1,156.72 an ounce.
In the national capital, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity declined by Rs 90 each to Rs 26,360 and Rs 26,160 per 10 grams, respectively.
Sovereign, however, remained steady at Rs 23,700 per piece of eight grams.
On similar lines, silver prices showed weakness and declined by Rs 100 to Rs 35,400 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Silver in Singapore fell by 0.2 per cent to US $15.65 an ounce.
While silver ready met with resistance and traded lower by Rs 100 to Rs 35,400 per kg, weekly-based delivery gained Rs 165 to Rs 34,765 per kg on speculative buying.
On the other hand, silver coins continued to be asked at last level of Rs 58,000 for buying and Rs 59,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

The benchmark BSE Sensex on Thursday fell from all-time level to settle the day 68 points lower at 27,940.64 as investors became cautious after excise duty on petrol and diesel was hiked even as inflation cooled off and factory output grew in signs of economic recovery.
The Sensex rose in early trade on hopes of rate cut after inflation softened to 5.52 per cent in October.
Three-month high industrial production growth of 2.5 per cent in September also boosted the sentiment, brokers said.
But soon profit-booking emerged after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs 13,000 crore in revenue.
Some investors fear this may weaken the fight against inflation, a broker said.
After a highly volatile trade, the bellwether index finally settled the day at 27,940.64, showing a loss of 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent from its yesterday's close, snapping three days of rise.
The 50-share Nifty also lost by 25.45 points or 0.30 per cent to 8,357.85.
On Wednesday, the benchmark index had ended at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90 and also hit intra-day high of 28,126.48 on sustained foreign funds inflows driven by economic reforms undertaken by the government recently.
Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors bought shares net of Rs 459.47 crs on Wednesday as per the provisional figures issued by stock exchanges.
The 30-share index in the previous three days had gained by 140.27 points or 0.50 per cent in the last three days.
"Indian equity markets cheered CPI and IIP with benchmark indices opening higher. But profit-taking was seen at higher levels.
"OMC (oil marketing companies) stocks witnessed profit booking, most banking shares were also weak on the index while IT and pharma stocks lifted the index," said Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
Stocks of state-run BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil Corp ended up to 6.11 per cent lower. ONGC was among the biggest Sensex losers, plunging by 2.03 per cent, while RIL fell by 0.53 per cent.
Major Sensex losers were SSLT (2.56 per cent), Tata Power (2.47 per cent), ONGC (2.03 per cent), Gail (1.58 per cent), Axis Bank (1.49 per cent), Hero Motocorp (1.38 per cent), HDFC (1.14 per cent), SBI (0.84 per cent) and ICICI Bank (0.83 per cent).
Infosys rose by 1.77 per cent, followed Dr Reddy's Lab 1.01 per cent, Cipla 0.91 per cent.
Among the sectoral indices, Oil&Gas fell by 1.63 per cent, followed by Realty 1.44 per cent, Metal 0.76 per cent, Bankex 0.71 per cent and Auto 0.39 per cent, while IT rose by 0.99 per cent and Teck 0.74 per cent.
The total market breadth turned negative as 1,733 stocks finished in the red, while 1,314 stocks closed in green. The total turnover dropped to Rs 3,529.31 crore from Rs 3,649.38 crore on Wednesday.
"The benchmarks were seen upholding sideways bias on Thursday as well, after the better than expected macro-economic data failed to trigger the directional move. In line with the key index, the sectoral indices too traded mixed whereas profit taking in the cash segment pushed the market breadth in the red," said Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities.
Sixteen scrips out of the 30-share Sensex pack ended lower while 14 others closed higher.
Asian markets were trading mixed.
Key indices in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore ended higher by 0.34-1.14 per cent, while indices in China and South Korea finished lower by 0.34-0.36 per cent.

AP Sources: Executive order to affect millions...ALICIA A. CALDWELL and ERICA WERNER | November 13, 2014 06:41 PM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is poised to act soon to unveil a series of executive actions on immigration that will shield possibly around 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally from deportation, according to advocates in touch with the White House.
The estimate includes extending deportation protections to parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years. The president is also likely to expand his 2-year-old program that protects young immigrants from deportation.
Timing of the announcement is unclear, though it's expected before the end of the year. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would review final recommendations after returning from his Asia trip next week.
Congressional Republicans are strongly opposed to Obama's plans, and as lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill this week following midterm elections in which the GOP retook the Senate, they vowed to oppose him.
"We're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path. This is the wrong way to govern. This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they didn't want," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday. "And so, all the options are on the table."
Some conservatives in the House and Senate announced plans to push for language in must-pass spending bills to block the president from acting. But other Republicans warned that such a push could result in another government shutdown like the one last year over Obama's health care plan.
"My sense is that the vast majority of us want to do everything we can to stop it, but also want to avoid outcomes that would prove bad for the country as a whole," said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. It wasn't clear, though, what other options Republicans had.
The advocates, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a public announcement, said that final details of the plan remained in flux. But the White House is likely to include parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, stipulating that they've resided in the U.S. for some period of time — possibly as little as five years. That group totals around 3.8 million people, according to the Migration Policy Institute.
Although Obama is not able to grant citizenship or permanent resident green cards on his own without Congress, he can offer temporary protection from deportation along with work authorization, as he has done in the past.
Adjustments also are expected to the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that allowed immigrants under 31 who had arrived before June 2007 to apply for a reprieve from deportation and a work permit. More than 600,000 young immigrants have been shielded from deportation to date under the program. Removing the upper age limit so that applicants don't have to be under 31 — one option under consideration — would make an additional 200,000 people eligible.
There may also be tweaks to business visa programs to speed up visas or make more available for high-tech workers or others.
Changes are also expected on the law enforcement side, including to a controversial program called Secure Communities that hands over people booked for local crimes to federal immigration authorities.  A former administration official with knowledge of the plans said the Secure Communities program would be eliminated or at least renamed, although some of the concepts would remain. Priorities for immigrants to be picked up by immigration authorities will also be revised to eliminate some of the less serious conduct that previously would have caused someone to be detained, said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private details.
In an interview on CBS' "Face The Nation" Sunday, Obama said he would prefer to sign comprehensive immigration legislation like the bill passed last year by the Senate. But absent that, "I am going to do what I can do through executive action." He said the Homeland Security Department is "deporting people who don't need to be deported."
Advocates are gearing up to embrace the long-sought changes, which Obama has delayed twice, most recently under pressure from Senate Democrats concerned about the midterm elections. At the same time they intend to keep pushing for wider protections and a legislative solution.
"This is definitely a step in the right direction and we would still encourage the administration to go even bigger than the estimated 5 million," said Kica Matos, of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement.  "This is a temporary fix and Republicans need to understand that the immigrant rights movement intends to wage a ferocious fight until we have permanent solution and that is through legislation."

Asia Dips While Japan Bucks Trend, Oil Hovers Near Lows
Reuters | Updated On: November 14, 2014 08:25 (IST)
Tokyo: Asian stocks dipped in early trade on Friday following fresh signs of slowing Chinese growth, while crude oil hovered near a four-year low in an oversupplied market.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.25 per cent.
The index has been confined to a narrow range this week as the US economy outperforms the euro zone and China.
China's economy lost further momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low.
"As the Federal Reserve policy shifts towards monetary tightening, the kind of risk aversion stemming from emerging markets we saw at the start of the year may take place again," said Junichi Ishikawa, a market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.
"The European Central Bank will play a key role in preventing such risk aversion. We may see instability continue in emerging markets until they are convinced that easing from the ECB and Bank of Japan can provide global support."
Tokyo shares outperformed their Asian peers, continuing to draw support from expectations that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call an election in December and possibly delay a sales tax hike. The Nikkei was up 0.1 percent, after hitting a fresh seven-year high.
The dollar hit a seven-year high of 116.20 yen on swirling Japanese election speculation.
US retail sales numbers due later in the day are awaited for further impetus.
The focus is on how the US Treasury market would react to the data after slightly softer than expected U.S. jobless claims numbers nudged bond yields lower on Thursday and momentarily capped the greenback.
The euro fetched $1.2465, continuing to inch away from a two-year low of $1.2358 struck last Friday.
US crude oil was up 13 cents at $74.34 a barrel, although the bounce paled in comparison to the 3.9 percent drop the commodity suffered on Thursday, when it fell to a four-year low of $74.07.
Oil has been hit this week by factors including a stockpile surge at a delivery point for US crude and reluctance by Saudi Arabia to cut output when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27.
Crude prices have slumped more than 30 per cent since June.

DDA misses deadline again  blames delay on technical glitchesDDA misses deadline due to 'technical glitches'
Sidhartha Roy , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 14, 2014

For the applicants of Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing scheme 2014, the wait for the lucky draw is turning out to be an endless one.
DDA's draw of lots which was formerly scheduled for November 5 has already been rescheduled twice, with DDA missing the latest deadline it had set for itself- November 14. They have been attributing the delay to technical glitches. (HT Photo)
The draw of lots, which was initially scheduled to be held on November 5, was postponed to November 10 after delay in the processing of applications, which was again rescheduled for November 14, according to DDA vice-chairman Balvinder Kumar.
DDA has been carrying out trial runs of the draw since Monday and facing technical glitches. This has resulted in the delay, leading DDA to miss the latest deadline it had set for itself.
 
The trial runs, or ‘mock draw’ are being jointly carried out by the Systems department of DDA and a team from C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) at the DDA headquarter Vikas Sadan, where the draw is going to be held.
Applicants can visit the DDA website to check their applications online and in case of any discrepancy in the details submitted, they can report these directly to the Director (Systems), DDA at 011-24694157 to get the errors rectified
 
“The C-DAC team has brought all the required hardware to DDA headquarter, and along with our systems officials are working almost 24X7 to ensure a smooth draw of lots,” said a senior DDA official.
“The problem is the huge number of applications and the large number of errors that crept into the forms that were submitted by applicants with designated banks."
 
DDA has received total 10,08,700 applications for the 25,034 flats on offer, most of which are one bedroom flats.
 
“The trial runs are going on and is taking a lot of time because there is a lot of data to be processed. We have been facing some technical glitches too,” said DDA vice-chairman Kumar.
“The mock draws are taking six to seven hours to complete because there are so many forms and so many categories, while we want to wrap up the draw between one to two hours,” he said.
 
“The software we are using is a bit old but the systems department feels it is safe and time tested and don’t want to change it,” added Kumar.

Pregnant Malaysia woman died due to faulty air bag...and
versions
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A Malaysian woman who died in a car accident due to a defective air bag manufactured by Takata Corp. was pregnant and perished with her unborn baby, Japanese automaker Honda said Friday.
Jordhatt Johan, head of public relations with Honda Malaysia, said the driver-side air bag in the woman's 2003 Honda City deployed abnormally and its inflator broke when the vehicle crashed into another car in the July 27 incident. Honda was notified about the accident a month later, he said.
"The woman died, unfortunately, and her foetus died too," Jordhatt said. "The cause of death was due to the rupture of the inflator."
Global recalls related to air bags manufactured by Japan's Takata number more than 12 million vehicles and the Malaysian death is the fifth worldwide. The other four deaths were in the United States.
Honda has already recalled millions of vehicles and this week expanded its recalls after getting new information about the fatality in July. Jordhatt said Honda only recently learnt that the inflator was defective in driver-side air bags because Takata failed to control the humidity during production.
Faulty inflators can explode, hurling shrapnel toward drivers and passengers.
Jordhatt said that globally, Honda is recalling 170,699 vehicles due to the faulty driver-side air bags.
Honda is still using Takata air bags and has no plans to switch as the company is satisfied that the problem was confined to the models being recalled, he said.
"We assure our customers that all our current models are not affected," he said.
He declined to give further details of the incident or comment on the issue of compensation.
The recalls worldwide involve 10 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co. and various nations such as Japan, China and European countries. About 8 million of the recalls are in the United States.
None of the vehicles included in the latest recall by Honda were sold in the U.S., the company said.
Takata CEO Shigehisa Takada apologized for the problems with the air bags in a statement issued Thursday, saying his company was determined to prevent further problems. The company is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department.

G-20 leaders to tackle corruption at summit... 
KRISTEN GELINEAU | November 14, 2014 01:09 AM EST | Associated Press
BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Corruption is a perennial topic for the G-20, with leaders dubbing it a threat to global growth, and activists arguing it hurts the poorest countries the most by siphoning away desperately needed money that could be used to improve health systems, schools and roads.
Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group ONE has urged leaders to make the issue a top priority at this weekend's summit in Brisbane after recently releasing a report that estimates money laundering, bribery and tax evasion cost the developing world more than $1 trillion a year. The group also estimates that as many as 3.6 million deaths could be prevented if money drained from the poorest countries by corruption was invested in health systems.
Anti-corruption group Transparency International, Amnesty International and other human rights groups have urged G-20 leaders to deliver concrete results at the summit, calling in particular for a crackdown on the use of shell companies that hide the true owners of businesses. Anti-corruption advocates want public registries created that would show who actually owns and benefits from companies.
Since 2010, the G-20 has issued two-year action plans on anti-corruption efforts, and a report on what has been achieved under the last plan is expected at this weekend's summit. The leaders will also issue a new plan for 2015-16, which is expected to include commitments on issues such as foreign bribery, stolen asset recovery and whistleblower protection, said A.J. Brown, a director with Transparency International Australia.

Facebook s privacy update: 5 things to know...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is once again trying to simplify its privacy policy, largely to address criticisms that it's too complex and lengthy for the average user.
Laid out with illustrations into short subsections, the new policy explains what types of information Facebook collects and how it uses the data. The new policy is 70 percent shorter than the old one.
Many of the changes are cosmetic, designed to make the policy easier to digest. Still, it helps to go through it to get an idea of all the things Facebook knows about you.
Users have until Nov. 20 to comment on the proposed changes or ask questions. A finalized version will take effect soon after that.
Here are five things to remember about Facebook's data policies.
— LOCATION, LOCATION
Facebook only recently began allowing businesses to advertise to users based on their specific location. Previously, ads were targeted based on the "current city" listed on the profile. Both the old policy and the new one note that the company can access your location information based on your smartphone's GPS information. The new policy points out that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals can also reveal device locations.
Besides that, Facebook can also collect information from the photos you share on the site, including where they were taken.
— BEYOND FACEBOOK
Facebook doesn't just track what you do on its site. It also collects information about your activities when you're off Facebook. For example, if you use Facebook to log in to outside websites and mobile apps, the company will receive data about those. It also gets information about your activity on other businesses it owns, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, in accordance with those services' privacy policies.
— AD TARGETING
Unless you decline targeting, or opt out, companies whose websites you visit off Facebook can also show you ads on Facebook. For example, a website can use browser cookies to record who visited it. It can then ask Facebook to show ads to these visitors — both on and off Facebook. If you want to opt out in the U.S., you can visit this website: http://aboutads.info/choices
— ALL EYES ON YOU
Everything is fair game. Facebook explains it best: "We collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others." Plus, Facebook says it also collects information about how you use Facebook, "such as the types of content you view or engage with or the frequency and duration of your activities."
— SHOPPING SPREE?
Facebook is testing a tool to let people buy things directly through its site. If you decide to do this, Facebook will collect information about your transaction, including your credit card number and billing and shipping address.

Narendra Modi arrives in Australia for G20 summitPM Narendra Modi arrives in Australia for G20 summit; to discuss black money issue

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will push for stepping up global cooperation against the key issue of cross border tax avoidance and evasion at the G20 summit starting in Brisbane on Saturday, as the government attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad.
The Prime Minister, who is the first Indian premier to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, arrived in Brisbane on a five-day trip to Australia on the second leg of his 10-day tour to three nations.
PM Modi will also undertake a bilateral visit to the Australian capital Canberra for talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott on Tuesday.
Modi will also utilise the 9th G20 summit, spanning over two days, of the world's biggest developed and emerging economies, to flag the country's concerns over "jobless growth" prospects.
Ahead of the summit, the Prime Minister felt that focusing on transforming the quality of life of people and not just on issues like the health of the financial markets was necessary for creating employment-generating economic growth.
It was a bright and sunny day at Brisbane as Modi stepped out of his Special Air India plane at the international airport after an overnight flight from Myanmar capital Nay Phi Taw where he attended two back-to-back international summits and had a string of bilateral meetings.
"Reached Brisbane. It is bright and sunny outside," the 64-year-old PM tweeted.
The Prime Minister was received at the airport by the Queensland Premier Campbell Newman among others. Indian High Commissioner in Australia Biren Nanda was also present at the airport.
"A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money," Modi had said, as he is set to renew the country's commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
The PM had also said he intends to discuss how G20 can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure, and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The G20 bloc includes 19 individual countries - Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the US - and the European Union (EU).
Collectively, the G20 economies account for around 85 per cent of the GDP, 80 per cent of world trade and two-thirds of the world population. The G20 was launched in 2008 in the US.
Jobs and growth will remain the focus of the G20 summit, despite strenuous lobbying to shift the spotlight to climate change and Ebola.
Australia, which holds the G20 presidency, re-emphasised on Friday the summit's mission when Treasurer Joe Hockey stressed the heavy burden on group members "to get real outcomes".
"We have a plan before the leaders of the world to grow the world economy, to create the jobs that are necessary, to lift people out of poverty, and we are determined to deliver that," Hockey said.
On the table is Australia's call for the G20 to collectively add at least two per cent to world growth to 2018. If successful, this could generate millions of jobs, massive infrastructure activity and cut red tape.
G20 countries have also produced 1,000 plans to support the growth target.
Modi, referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney besides Canberra, had earlier said, "While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential."
"A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India's economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood," he said.
Government officials said that Modi's trip will be a "landmark visit" and is aimed at "re-engaging" Australia.
Abott had a telephonic talk with the Prime Minister before his departure from the country to discuss the agenda for the multilateral meeting and he asked Modi to share, in particular, his vision for accelerating global economic growth and employment generation.
The Australian premier conveyed that he and the Australian people were keenly awaiting the visit of Modi, who appreciated his personal attention to his visit and emphasised the importance he attached to his Australia visit as a step towards qualitatively transforming a relationship that he greatly values.
Abbott also sought Modi's support for Australia's infrastructure initiatives in the G20.
On his part, PM Modi thanked his Australian counterpart for his leadership in developing a meaningful agenda for the G20 Summit and expressed confidence that it would be one of the most memorable G20 Summits, which will impart new momentum to the global economy.

Bombay HC stays job quota for Marathas  says community not backwardPrint
Written by Aamir Khan | Mumbai | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:43 pm | Updated: November 15, 2014 1:30 am
The Bombay High Court on Friday stayed the ordinance brought in by the previous Congress government in the state to provide reservation \to the Maratha community in government jobs and educational institutions.
The order came while the court was hearing a bunch of petitions contesting the state Cabinet’s decision on July 9, reserving 16 per cent seats in government jobs and educational institutions for Marathas and five per cent seats for Muslims.
The total reservation in the state had thereby gone up to 73 per cent.
The Bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice M S Sonak also stayed five per cent quota for Muslims in government jobs but allowed reservation in educational institutions, except private ones, citing “abysmally low” educational achievements.
The court made it clear that those already given reservation will not be disturbed till the final outcome of the case. It observed that Marathas “were not” a backward community and the state did not have the power to exceed the 50 per cent reservation limit set by the Supreme Court.
In extraordinary cases, the reservation may exceed 50 per cent given the same is justified by the state, the bench said. Shortly after the court order, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said his government will appeal in the Supreme Court. “My government is committed to reservation for the Maratha community. If there are certain discrepancies in the law pointed by the High Court, we will take measures to make the necessary corrections. The lacuna will be addressed to ensure that the quota for the Maratha community comes into force,” he said.
The state had earlier filed an affidavit justifying its decision to offer reservation to the Maratha community, contending that reservation had been given twice to them in the pre-independence era but were withdrawn after independence.
The affidavit contended that 16 per cent reservation for the community was made on the basis of “compelling and quantifiable” data. “Even in the decision-making process it is clearly mentioned that earlier in the year 1902 as well as 1942 reservation was provided to the Maratha community as backward class but thereafter in the post-independence era such reservation was withdrawn. This resulted in educational, social and economic backwardness of the community and, therefore, prima facie, reservation is justified,” the state had said in its affidavit.
Social activist Ketan Tirodkar, who was the first to move a PIL against the state’s decision in June, had claimed that 85 per cent of the sugar factories in the state were “owned/controlled by Marathas”. In addition, 75 per cent and more land is owned by the Maratha community in the state and more than 72 per cent of co-operative institutions are controlled by Marathas, he had said.

Nuclear-capable Prithvi-II missile successfully test firedDescribing the trial as "fully successful," ITR Director M V K V Prasad told PTI that the test was conducted by Strategic Force Command. (Source: Reuters photo)
By: Press Trust of India | Balasore (odisha) | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:27 pm
India on Friday successfully test-fired its indigenously developed nuclear-capable Prithvi-II surface-to-surface missile, which has a strike range of 350 km, from a test range at Chandipur near here as part of a user trial by Army.
Defence sources said the state-of-the-art missile, which is capable of carrying 500 kg to 1000 kg of warheads, was test-fired from a mobile launcher in salvo mode from launch complex-3 of Integrated Test Range at about 10.40 hrs.
It is thrusted by liquid propulsion twin engines and uses advanced inertial guidance system with manoeuvring trajectory.
Describing the trial as “fully successful,” ITR Director M V K V Prasad told PTI that the test was conducted by Strategic Force Command.
The sophisticated missile was randomly chosen from the production stock and the entire launch activities were carried out by SFC and monitored by scientists of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as part of training exercise, defence sources said.
“The missile trajectory was tracked by DRDO radars, electro-optical tracking systems and telemetry stations located along the coast of Odisha.
“The downrange teams onboard the ship deployed near the designated impact point in the Bay of Bengal monitored the terminal events and splashdown,” the sources said.
Prithvi II, which was inducted into the SFC in 2003, is the first missile to be developed by DRDO under India’s prestigious Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP) and is now a proven technology.
Today’s launch was part of a regular training exercise of SFC and was monitored by DRDO scientists, the sources said.     Such training launches clearly indicate India’s operational readiness to meet any eventuality and also establishes the reliability of this deterrent component of India’s Strategic arsenal, the sources said.
The last user trials of Prithvi-II in 2014 were successfully carried out from the same base on January 7, 2014 and March 28, 2014, they  added.

October WPI inflation dips to 5-year low of 1.77%food articles
(While primary articles…)
NEW DELHI: Falling food and commodity prices saw wholesale inflation easing to a five-year low in October, putting more pressure on Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan to cut interest rates to stimulate demand and investment at the December 2 monetary policy announcement.
Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) slowed to 1.77% in October from 2.38% in September, the sixth successive month of decline and the lowest since September 2009, data released by the commerce department on Friday showed.
Consumer inflation, the price gauge more closely watched by the RBI, eased to a multi-year low of 5.52% in October, according to data released on Wednesday.
Rajan has left the key repo rate unchanged at 8% after raising it by 25 basis points in January, but could find it challenging to hew to his tough monetary stance given that retail inflation is well below RBI's March 2015 target of 8% and lower than the 6% limit set for January 2016.
"There could be a strong case for the RBI to consider a rate cut given the continuous decline in the CPI (consumer price index) and WPI inflation numbers in the last few months," Care Ratings said in a note. India's economy expanded 5.7% in the April-June quarter, the most in more than two years, but the revival is still uncertain. The government will be keenly watching monetary policy, which has been a source of friction between RBI and North Block under the previous government.
Industrial production was up only 2.5% in September, ending a dismal quarter, with July production rising 0.41% and August up 0.48%. Production of consumer durables, an indicator of demand, fell 11.3% in September. Car sales didn't perk up during the festival season, dropping 2.55% in October.
Some experts have already lowered their GDP forecast for the year following the softer quarter of industrial growth.
Industry reiterated its demand for a rate cut.
  "This (decline in inflation) provides sufficient room to the RBI to review its prolonged pause in policy rates and move towards policy easing in its forthcoming monetary policy, especially as investment and consumption demand are yet to show visible signs of a pick-up," the Confederation of Indian Industry lobby group said in a statement. Industry has blamed high interest rates for poor housing and consumer goods demand besides softer investments.
Rajan has been unambiguous in his view that the RBI wants to overcome inflation once and for all, instead of relenting on its campaign at the first sign of prices easing. That's why most experts don't expect a rate cut next month, although markets are already pricing in precisely such a move with bond yields trending lower and interest-rate sensitive sectors such as banking and real estate rising sharply on stock exchanges in the last 30 days.
Some analysts suggest that the central bank will wait for the budget in February to get a sense of the government's finances and a better idea of where commodity prices are heading before deciding on interest rates.
"While RBI is likely to draw comfort from the recent softening of inflationary momentum, it is expected to lean on the side of caution and ease policy rates only when there are credible signs that the structural drivers of inflation have turned sanguine," said Shubhada Rao, chief economist, YES Bank.
"If the pace of decline in global commodity prices sustains, we expect pect the rate-cutting cycle to begin as soon as April. We continue to expect a cumulative of 50 basis points repo rate cut during the course of FY16," she added.
The waning of the base effect-high inflation in 2013 has amplified the decline this year- from December is also one of the reasons RBI may wait, preferring to see how it pans out from January.
Food inflation fell to 2.7% in October from 3.52% in the previous month, with vegetable prices facing 19.6% deflation. "Although headline WPI is likely to remain sub-3% in the remainder of FY15, food inflation is expected to rear up as the base effect fades away," said Aditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA.
While deflation in onion prices deepened in October to 60%, inflation in potato rates eased marginally to 82.11%. Core inflation, tracked by RBI, eased to a 13-month low of 2.55% in October from 2.81% in September.

Oil and politics: A senator scraps for survival...and
versions
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress inched closer Friday to a possible showdown with President Barack Obama over the Keystone XL oil pipeline as the Republican-controlled House approved the project. Supporters in the Democratic-run Senate predicted they will get the 60 votes needed to pass it next week.
The House vote was 252-161 in favor of the bill, which was sponsored by Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., in an effort to boost his chances to take a Louisiana Senate seat away from Democrat Mary Landrieu. The two are headed for a Dec. 6 runoff and have been touting their energy credentials in the oil and gas-producing state.
Should the Senate send the bill to Obama for his signature, he would face a decision that pits some of his environmental concerns about the pipeline, mainly its consequences for global warming, against potentially helping a fellow Democrat making a longshot bid to retain her Senate seat.
The House bill was supported by 221 Republicans, with not a single GOP lawmaker voting against it. Thirty-one Democrats backed the bill, while 161 rejected it.
"This will make it easier for the Senate to do right by the American people and finally vote on building the pipeline," Cassidy said in a statement after the vote.
The bill's passage marked the ninth time the House had passed a bill to speed up the pipeline's construction.
Landrieu pushed the Senate to hold its upcoming vote on the measure. In a call with reporters from Louisiana, where she was campaigning, Landrieu called herself the "sparkplug" to get the Keystone bill through Congress. The House bill is identical to one introduced by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Landrieu in May.
"This bill was drafted to go the distance," said Landrieu.
As of Friday, supporters of the measure appeared to have at least 59 of the 60 Senate votes they would need for approval next week. That included all 45 Republicans and 14 Democrats.
Landrieu conceded, though, that it is unlikely the Senate or House will have the two-thirds majorities that would be needed to override an Obama veto of the bill. She said she did not know Obama's plans.
"He most certainly understands my position," Landrieu said. "He understands that there are 15-plus Democrats in the Senate that really want to build the Keystone pipeline."
If the bill fails to pass the Senate next week, Hoeven said he would reintroduce it next year when Republicans will control the chamber. That would make it one of many showdowns expected with Obama over energy and environmental policy after Republicans take full control of Congress in January.
The $8 billion pipeline has become a symbol for the divisions on the country's energy and environmental policy. Environmentalists have framed the issue as a significant test of Obama's commitment to address climate change. Republicans and other supporters say it is necessary for jobs and energy security, because the U.S. would be importing oil from its neighbor, not the Middle East. Still others have criticized the project because some of the product refined from the oil could be exported to other countries, instead of used here.
The project has been stalled by environmental reviews, by objections to the route it would take and by politics for six years. While the White House has issued veto threats on similar legislation before, it had yet to formally do so Friday.
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said it was time for Obama to listen to the American people, especially after Republican gains in last week's midterm elections, and sign the bill.
"The president doesn't have any more elections to win, and he has no other excuse for standing in the way," Boehner said.
Obama, questioned about the issue while traveling on the other side of the globe, said the administration's long-stalled review of the project cannot be completed before knowing the outcome of a legal challenge to the pipeline's route through Nebraska. He also reiterated that he will ultimately judge the project on its impact on climate change and energy prices.
"I have to constantly push back against this idea that somehow the Keystone pipeline is either this massive jobs bill for the United States, or is somehow lowering gas prices," Obama said. "Understand what this project is.  It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else.  That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices."
The State Department said in a Jan. 31 report that the project would not significantly boost carbon emissions because the oil was likely to find its way to market by other means. It added that transporting it by rail or truck would cause greater environmental problems than if the Keystone XL pipeline were built.
The 1,179-mile project is proposed to go from Canada through Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska, where it would connect with existing pipelines to carry more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast.

RBI to invite payment bank applications by month-endRBI to invite small and payment bank applications by month-end

RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan (Photo: Reuters)
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will invite applications for setting up of small and payment banks - aimed to cater to small businesses and low income households - by the end of this month after putting in place final norms in this regard.
Besides, Reserve Bank is also planning to revamp its cash management system, Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday.
Addressing micro-financiers at a Nabard function in Mumbai, Rajan also said that microfinance borrowers should be protected from arbitrary loan pricing.
The RBI Governor also reiterated his reservation against repeated loan waivers by various state governments, saying the move distorts credit pricing, thereby also disrupting the credit market.
"There should be a reasonable ceiling on interest rate on loans from microfinance lenders for consumer protection," he said.
Following the October 2010 crisis in the then undivided Andhra Pradesh that crippled the MFI sector, an RBI-appointed Malegam panel had suggested 26 per cent monthly cap on interest rates for the sector. This cap was notified by the central bank in April 2012.
The Andhra Pradesh crisis began after the state government banned recovery by any coercive means, following a string of alleged suicides by micro-credit borrowers.
Both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments have declared loan waivers for the farmers hit by cyclone Phailin last year.
While the Telangana government has given the mandated 25 per cent of the written off loan amount to the banks, Andhra Pradesh has not done it so far.
Banks have over Rs 1.3 trillion exposure to the farm sector in these two states.

GOP votes McConnell to lead Senate; Dems elevate Warren

WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans unanimously named Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to serve as majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January. Democrats, meanwhile, elevated Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to a newly created seat at the leadership table as part of their efforts to renew the party's economic message.
McConnell's elevation was not in doubt after Republicans picked up at least eight seats in the midterm elections. A Louisiana Senate race heads to a Dec. 6 runoff where GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy is favored over Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. If he wins, McConnell will have a 54-seat majority next year.
Democrats re-elected Harry Reid of Nevada to lead their caucus, but also added new faces to their leadership team to include Warren and Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is filling a slot held by Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, who lost re-election. Klobuchar said she would work to "break through the gridlock" that defined the current Congress.
Warren is a popular figure among the party's progressive base, which had lackluster turnout on Election Day. Senate Democrats now have four women serving in a leadership team that also includes Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.
Democrats are working to fine-tune an economic message that failed to inspire their voters in the midterms. Warren is a favorite of the party's liberal wing, which embraces her populist style and willingness to take on the banking and financial services industries.
"You know, Wall Street is doing very well, CEOs are bringing in millions more, and families all across this country are struggling. We have to make this government work for the American people, and that's what we're here to fight for," Warren said following Thursday's leadership elections.

At least six Democrats said publicly they did not support Reid's re-election following the loss of the Democratic majority. Voters "want change in Washington," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said in a statement. "Common sense tells me that begins with changes in leadership." Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana also voted against Reid. The Washington Post reported Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner did as well.
McConnell, first elected to the Senate in 1984, has served as minority leader since 2007. The GOP takeover delivered him a personal career goal to serve as majority leader. He is the second Kentucky senator elected to the post. Former Kentucky Democratic Sen. Alben Barkley served as majority leader before becoming vice president under President Harry Truman, and he briefly considered a presidential run. McConnell is not known to harbor ambitions beyond the Senate chamber.
Senate Republicans also elected Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi to chair their 2016 campaign operation. Wicker defeated Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada. Democrats selected Sen. Jon Tester of Montana to chair their 2016 campaign operation.
Nancy Pelosi: Queries about tenure in leadership are sexist
Across the Capitol on Thursday, House Republicans re-elected House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who will need to be approved by the full U.S. House on the first day of the new Congress, as required by the Constitution. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., were also re-elected to their leadership posts.
House Democrats will hold leadership elections next week. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is seeking re-election unopposed. Pelosi took issue Thursday with a question about whether she would consider stepping down.
"It is just interesting as a woman to see how many times that question is asked of a woman and how many times that question is never asked of Mitch McConnell," said Pelosi, 74, about McConnell, 72, noting that the Kentucky Republican oversaw losses in his chamber for three elections in a row. "I'm here as long as my members want me to be here, as long as there's a reason to be here. I'm not here on a schedule, on anything except a mission to get a job done."
Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, got the approval from fellow House Republicans on Thursday to remain speaker in the next Congress, where the GOP will have an expanded majority.

Coming soon: Two smart cities along Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridorFICCI
(The Narendra Modi-led NDA…)
MUMBAI: The Centre is likely to roll out the final plans for at least two of its proposed 100 'smart cities' along the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) by the end of the current financial year, a senior government official said.
The Narendra Modi-led NDA government has decided to create industrial agglomeration along the proposed five industrial corridors including the DMIC, Bangalore-Mumbai Economic Corridor, Chennai-Vizag Corridor, Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Development Corridor, Chennai-Bangalore and East-Coast Economic Corridor.
"The new government has put emphasis on developing physical infrastructure and growth in manufacturing sector. We have planned industrial agglomeration along the five proposed corridors to boost manufacturing along with catering to the demand of workers there for better living," Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) additional secretary Shatrughna Singh told the media on the sidelines of FICCI Real Estate Summit in Mumbai on Thursday. Singh said the DMIC will have around 22 locations, which will be developed as smart cities.
"Out of the 22, seven places will be taken up in the first phase. To begin with, we have identified two places including Dholera in Gujarat and Shendra-Bidkin near Aurangabad in Maharashtra where we will see the actual ground work. In this fiscal, we can see some tendering happening by the respective governments for the development in these regions," he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier announced the government's plans to develop 100 smart cities across the country that will provide modern amenities, education and employment opportunities.
The government has also decided to create a National Industrial Corridor Authority (NICA), which will cover all the corridors except the DMIC, to channelise institutional funding for smart cities. "We expect the authority to be formed in this fiscal itself," Singh said.
The government is looking to create special purpose vehicle for every node in which central and state government themselves will also be equity partners. The equity stake could be offered to private firms and funding institutions, Singh said, adding that DIPP will look at development of smart cities while urban development department will handle redeveloping of exiting cities.

No more red ink on files  Narendra Modi govt tells bureaucratsGovernment files
(The Narendra Modi-led government…)
NEW DELHI: The Modi government has instructed all senior bureaucrats to not use red or green ink on any official files, thereby scrapping a 14-year-old rule brought by an NDA government as well that gave senior officers the liberty to use an ink different from the junior bureaucrats.
The government has amended the Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure (CSMOP), the Narendra Modi-led Ministry of Personnel informed all secretaries of government ministries last month. Since the year 2000, senior bureaucrats of the level of Joint Secretary and above were given the liberty to writes notes on files in red/green ink while junior bureaucrats could only write notes in blue or black ink. All bureaucrats have now been told to use only blue/black ink on files as per an amendment made to the CSMOP.
A senior government official told ET that this is a good administrative reform measure brought to "bring parity" to notes made by all levels of bureaucracy on the files. "Why is there a need for the senior officer to write in a separate colour ink on the file to attract the attention of the Minister or Secretary? His noting can be recognised from his signature on the file. The stipulation had a colonial hangover to it tending to stress that a senior officer's view carries more weight besides leaving a file with multiple ink marks when it went before the Minister," the senior official said.
Also, the earlier stipulation was that senior officers can use red or green ink on files in "rare cases" when they want to point out something significant through their comments on the file. "But it had lately become a norm rather than an exception. Hence the same has been scrapped on orders of the competent authority," a government official said, pointing out that the Ministry of Personnel is directly under the PM.
In his book written in 2004, "Governance", former Cabinet Minister Arun Shourie had revealed how two Steel Ministry bureaucrats in the year 1999 had initiated a move that senior bureaucrats be allowed to write on files in an ink different from their subordinates.
The NDA government then brainstormed on the same for a year before getting an opinion from the National Archives of India which said that notes written in red or green ink would not fade away any faster than those written in black or blue -- paving the way for the change to be made in the year 2000. 14 years later, the Modi Government has scrapped the move.

Nuclear-capable Prithvi-II missile successfully testfiredDescribing the trial as "fully successful," ITR Director M V K V Prasad told PTI that the test was conducted by Strategic Force Command. (Source: Reuters photo)

India on Friday successfully test-fired its indigenously developed nuclear-capable Prithvi-II surface-to-surface missile, which has a strike range of 350 km, from a test range at Chandipur near here as part of a user trial by Army.
Defence sources said the state-of-the-art missile, which is capable of carrying 500 kg to 1000 kg of warheads, was test-fired from a mobile launcher in salvo mode from launch complex-3 of Integrated Test Range at about 10.40 hrs.
It is thrusted by liquid propulsion twin engines and uses advanced inertial guidance system with manoeuvring trajectory.
Describing the trial as “fully successful,” ITR Director M V K V Prasad told PTI that the test was conducted by Strategic Force Command.
The sophisticated missile was randomly chosen from the production stock and the entire launch activities were carried out by SFC and monitored by scientists of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as part of training exercise, defence sources said.
“The missile trajectory was tracked by DRDO radars, electro-optical tracking systems and telemetry stations located along the coast of Odisha.
“The downrange teams onboard the ship deployed near the designated impact point in the Bay of Bengal monitored the terminal events and splashdown,” the sources said.
Prithvi II, which was inducted into the SFC in 2003, is the first missile to be developed by DRDO under India’s prestigious Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP) and is now a proven technology.
Today’s launch was part of a regular training exercise of SFC and was monitored by DRDO scientists, the sources said.     Such training launches clearly indicate India’s operational readiness to meet any eventuality and also establishes the reliability of this deterrent component of India’s Strategic arsenal, the sources said.
The last user trials of Prithvi-II in 2014 were successfully carried out from the same base on January 7, 2014 and March 28, 2014, they  added.

Shiv Sena sits in opposition in MaharashtraShiv Sena sits in opposition in Maharashtra
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 10, 2014
First Published: 12:27 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:27 IST(11/11/2014)
As the new Maharashtra assembly held its first sitting on Monday, the Shiv Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition even as it continued to negotiate with the BJP on joining the government.
 
The BJP confirmed talks were on but reiterated that the Sena should accept what was offered and stop demanding a certain number of ministerial berths or portfolios.

Undermining the seriousness of the legislature’s procedures in its bid to pressure the BJP, the Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for leader of the Opposition. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray justified it saying he sent the letter to the legislature secretary because the Congress was rushing to grab the post.
“The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn’t work? Then we won’t get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader),” Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening. If the talks with BJP fail the Sena would perform the role of a strong opposition party, he added.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands —10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister — to vote in favour of the trust vote on November 12. The BJP is 23 votes short of a majority.
The two parties split just before the assembly elections after 25 years together. Now, both have taken strong positions on power-sharing, but are still talking. A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself would prefer to go with `natural ally’ Sena, but wants Thackeray to make `reasonable’ demands since the BJP already has 121 seats.
The Sena leadership, while slowly reconciling itself to sitting in the opposition, is wary the BJP could poach some of its 63 MLAs. It is also worried it could lose control of the Mumbai civic body, where it is in alliance with the BJP.
On Sunday, Thackeray asked Anil Desai, the Sena’s Rajya Sabha member who was to join Narendra Modi’s ministry, to boycott the swearing in. Later, he asked the BJP to clarify its stand on seeking the NCP’s support from outside.
On Monday, the Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition a couple of hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar reiterated his resolve to support the BJP from outside and ridiculed Thackeray for making remarks against him a day before.   
Armed with a plan B for winning the trust vote – support from the NCP and 14 to 17 MLAs from small parties and Independents -- the BJP was still hopeful of patching up with the Sena. It prefers the Sena because of their common ideology and experience of working together. The BJP was unwilling to go with NCP because of the party’s tainted track record.
The BJP can expect find the going tough if it leans on the NCP. Pawar gave it a veiled warning on Monday when he said that the BJP should reopen and inquire into all the cases (of corruption and irregularities) against his leaders. 
A confident Fadnavis, who said earlier his mandate (from the party high command) was to govern and not to save the government, put on a brave face by telling party colleagues that he would sail through in any case.
When asked, Fadnavis refused to comment on the matter.
A senior BJP leader told HT that the doors were kept open for the Sena even after the day’s development. “Talks with the Sena are on through several channels. We are still hopeful of the Sena withdrawing the claim [to the post of leader of the opposition] if we strike a suitable deal.”
 

Investing in Fixed Deposits Why You Should RethinkYou are here: Home Your Money
Investing in Bank FDs? Why You Should Rethink
NDTV | Updated On: December 03, 2014 12:12 (IST)
RBI Doubles Pre-Paid Card Limit to Rs 1 Lakh
Bank fixed deposits have been among the most popular investment bets for a majority of Indians. They offer attractive rates (around 9 per cent for one year tenure) with almost no risk.
The negative aspect of fixed deposit investments is taxation. Interest on fixed deposits is added to the income of the investor and then taxed according to his/her tax slab.
(Read | Kisan Vikas Patra Vs Bank FD: What You Should Know )
A better deal for investors would be to put their money in debt mutual funds, analysts say. Debt instruments offer nearly same returns as fixed deposits, but provide better tax protection. Debt mutual funds invest in long-term government bonds, which have rallied sharply over the past month.
Why Government Bonds Have Rallied
There are expectations that the Reserve Bank of India will cut interest rates earlier-than-expected because of inflation has eased to multi-year lows. Hopes of a rate cut have made investments in government bonds attractive as these bonds were issued at higher coupons. The 10-year bond carries a coupon of 8.40 per cent, but its yield has already fallen to below 8 per cent levels, its lowest in over a year.
When yields fall, bond prices go up leading to substantial gains for debt mutual funds. The average one-year return from debt mutual funds that invest predominantly in medium-term to long-term government bonds has ranged above 15 per cent, according to Morningstar data. And in the past one month these funds have given over 2.5 per cent return.
A Balasubramanian, CEO of Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company, said bond markets are attractive from a medium-term perspective. He has been advising investors to take some exposure in government bond funds that have an average duration of 3-6 years.
Alternatively, Mr Balasubramanian suggests investors to invest in dynamic debt bond funds in which fund managers actively shuffle the bond portfolio to take advantage of emerging opportunities.
Jayesh Mehta, country treasurer at Bank of America (BofA), also expects the rally in bond markets to continue. In fact, he expects the bond yields on 10-year government bonds to fall by around 75 basis points in the next 8 to 12 months. This will further boost bond prices and lead to higher net asset value of debt mutual funds.
Analysts say improving liquidity in the financial system has also been attributed to the rally in bonds. High liquidity, however, has led to a fall in fixed deposit rates.
Tax Treatment
Debt mutual funds score over fixed deposits in terms of their taxation. Investors can claim indexation benefit on debt mutual fund schemes after three years, significantly lowering their tax outgo on the gains. On the other hand, the interest on fixed deposits is fully taxable. It is added to the income of the investor and taxed as normal income.
Rate Cut Outlook
Jayesh Mehta of Bank of America does not see the RBI cutting rates at its December 2 policy review. "The RBI will keep a close watch on the global oil prices, trend in vegetable prices and the government's fiscal situation given that the divestment programme has not yet kicked off," he said. But he is optimistic of the RBI cutting rates in the next six months.
Similarly, Mr Balasubramanian of Birla Sun Life AMC also does not see much chance of a rate cut on December 2. The RBI is likely to keep a watch on the inflation trend further before taking any rate action, he says. He expects the RBI cutting rates towards the middle of next year.
"Our outlook on interest rate remains positive" and investors betting on government bonds will gain, he said.

arrest
“I am being blamed for the deaths, which is incorrect. They should arrest the Chief Medical Officer of Bilaspur and District Health Officer,” Dr. R.K. Gupta said after his arrest.
The doctor who conducted 83 sterilisation surgeries at the government-organised family planning camp in Pendhari area of Bilaspur, has been arrested from Chhattisgarh’s Balodabajar district.
R.K.Gupta had allegedly conducted 83 surgeries in five hours on November 8, 2014 after which, within a few hours, 12 women died and more than 60 had to be admitted to the hospital.
However, Dr. Gupta claimed that he was "innocent" and his superiors were making him "scapegoat".
“I am alone being blamed for the deaths, which is incorrect. They should arrest the Chief Medical Officer of Bilaspur and District Health Officer. They should also be charged with the same provisions of law under which they have charged me,” Dr.Gupta told reporters after his arrest.
“Dr. Gupta claimed that he was being wrongly implicated for wrong policies of the government. ”
On the allegations of “criminal negligence” against him, Dr. Gupta pleaded innocence.
“The operations were conducted properly by following the standard procedure. The patients took ill after being given the medicines which seem to be outdated. Had they been given proper medicines, this incident would not have happened,” the doctor, who was once honoured by Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh for “maximum number of family planning operations”, told the media.
When asked if he did not check the medicines before they were given to the patients, Dr. Gupta said, “How can I examine the medicine just by looking at it? There are other methods through which the medicines should have been examined before being given to the women who underwent surgery.”
Accusing the government and his superiors of making him a "scapegoat", Dr. Gupta claimed that he was being wrongly implicated for "wrong policies" of the government.

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) on Thursday reported more than double of its net profit in September quarter on back of subsidy support from the government.
Net profit at Rs 850.31 crore, or Rs 25.11 per share, in July-September was 166 per cent higher than Rs 318.92 crore, or Rs 9.42 a share, net profit in the same period a year ago.
HPCL director (Finance) K V Rao said the company bear only Rs 8 crore loss on fuel sales after government gave cash subsidy of Rs 1,403 crore and upstream firms like ONGC doled out Rs 3,751 crore to meet under-recoveries on diesel and cooking fuels.

Arkansas Gov. To Pardon Son On Drug Chargereddit
Outgoing Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe (D) told a local television station on Wednesday that he would pardon his son for a 2003 marijuana conviction.
Kyle Beebe, now 34, served probation after his arrest more than a decade ago for felony possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, KATV reported . Gov. Beebe, then the state attorney general, said at the time that his son would be treated like any other offender, according to KATV.
Kyle Beebe completed his probation in 2006. On Oct. 20, the Arkansas Parole Board recommended that he be pardoned. A pardon may restore rights that had been revoked by the felony conviction, including the right to bear arms, according to the Arkansas governor's website.
Gov. Beebe told KATV the pardon took so long because his son had not requested it.
"I would have done it a long time ago if he'd have asked, but he took his sweet time about asking. He was embarrassed. He's still embarrassed, and frankly, I was embarrassed and his mother was embarrassed,” Beebe told KATV. “All of the families that go through that, it's tough on the families, but hopefully the kids learn."
In his petition for a pardon, Kyle Beebe said that he was "young and dumb" when he decided to sell drugs.
"At the time of my arrest I was living in a fantasy world, not reality," he wrote. "I was young and dumb. At that time in my life I felt like I was missing something and I tried to fill that emptiness by selling drugs. I am asking for a second chance to be a better son to my parents and prove to them that I am the person they raised me to be."
The governor told KATV that he was willing to forgive his son for his mistakes.
"Kids when they're young do stupid stuff. He was no different. Liked to have broken his mother's heart. His mother and I were stereotypical parents from the different end of the spectrum,” Gov. Beebe said. "She was the enabler that tried to fix everything. I was the nuclear bomb thrower that thought you ought to shoot him. Somewhere between those two extremes was probably the right thing to do."
An Arkansas Parole Board spokesman said Beebe received no special treatment. Law enforcement didn't object to the recommendation for a pardon.
Beebe was first elected governor in 2006 and will leave office at the end of this year because of term limits. He will be succeeded by Asa Hutchinson (R), a former congressman and Drug Enforcement Administration administrator.

Macchil fake encounter: life term for 5 Army menimprisonment
Court-martial finds them guilty in encounter case
The Army on Thursday sentenced five of its personnel, including two officers, to life imprisonment for staging the killing of three Kashmiri civilians in the Macchil area of Kupwara district in 2010 and branding them as foreign militants for rewards and remunerations.
Those sentenced by the Army’s summary general court martial are the then Commanding Officer of 4 Rajput regiment, Col. Dinesh Pathania, Captain Upendra Singh, havildar Davender, lance naik Lakhmi and lance naik Arun Kumar.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah welcomed the decision, calling it a “watershed moment.”
On April 30, 2010, Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Mohammad Shafi Lone and Riyaz Ahmad Lone, all residents of Nadihal in Sopore, were lured to work as porters for the Army on the promise of high wages.
They were later killed in a staged encounter and passed off as foreign militants.
Let Macchil sentence serve as warning: Omar
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the sentencing of five Army men in the Macchil fake encounter case, in which three Kashmiri civilians were killed and branded as foreign militants, should serve as a warning to those security personnel who may want to target innocent persons.
“No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases. Faith in institutions had disappeared. I hope that we never ever see such Macchil fake encounter type of incidents again & let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try,” Mr. Abdullah tweeted.
An Army court concluded its inquiry into the Macchil case in September and its sentence has now been sent to the Northern Army Commander for formal approval. If approved, all the five personnel will be imprisoned. The process may take a couple of months.
Reacting to the sentence, the mother of one of the victims called the convicted Army men murderers. “My son went once [to work for the Army] and was paid Rs. 500 for a day’s work. That amount was three times the money he usually earned. So when he was asked to come again, he willingly went but it was all a plan to murder him. It was not that they killed my son in anger or by mistake, they murdered him,” Naseema Bano, the mother of Riyaz Ahmad Lone told The Hindu.
The army has handed out life sentences to 7 inc the CO in the Machil fake encounter case of 2010. This is indeed a very welcome step 1/n
— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) November 13, 2014
This is a watershed moment. No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases. Faith in institutions disappeared 2/n
— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) November 13, 2014
I hope that we never see such #Machil fake encounter type of incidents ever again & let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try 3/3
— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) November 13, 2014
Human rights organisations such as the Amnesty International welcomed the decision and said it indicated commitment to justice for human rights violations in Kashmir. Local rights organisations, which have been working on cases of staged killings, said the judgment should not be used to whitewash other cases.
“We hope this case will not be used as a whip to silence the critics of AFSPA and whitewash hundreds of human rights violations like Kunan-Poshpora mass rape, Pathribal killings and Badar Payeen killings in which the Army is still in a denial mode,” said Parvez Imroz, a human rights lawyer who heads the Coalition of Civil Society in Kashmir.
The Macchil fake encounter triggered the 2010 mass protests in Kashmir in which a large number of civilians took to the streets, demanding the right to self-determination. More than 120 young, unarmed protesters were killed in police firing during the protests.

More Than the Minimum: Obama s Next Executive Actionreddit
On Thursday, several hundred low-wage federal contract employees walked off their jobs in the nation's capitol, telling President Obama that "$10.10 is not enough," demanding a livable wage and the right to organize. While praising the president for issuing the executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contract employees to $10.10, they argued that it was time for "more than the minimum."
These workers are calling for a Good Jobs Executive Order that would give preference in government procurement to good employers that (1) pay their employees a living wage of $15.00 an hour, (2) offer good American benefits, including paid sick days, and (3) respect their employees' right to organize and bargain collectively to gain a fair share of the profits and productivity they help to create.  This action is vital, as the New York Times reported, "to ensuring that federal contracting is not a contest to see who can pay the least, but a rational process both for ensuring good jobs at fair play and for setting an example for the private sector."
Today, the US government is America's leading low-wage employer.  These are workers like Reginald Lewis who spoke at the rally, as reported by Richard Long of CAF:
"I'm a worker at the Capitol. This building symbolizes the American Dream for so many, but not for me and my kids. I'm paid $12 an hour, but I receive food stamps to live. I'm 50 years old, and I can't afford to save for retirement. My ex-wife and I are trying to help my daughter pay for college, but we can't afford the tuition. My company is making $6 billion in profits, and we aren't getting any of that at all."
With a stroke of the pen, the president can have a dramatic effect on the lives of Lewis and millions of workers, leveraging not only the $1 trillion in spending on federal contracts, but setting an example that will accelerate similar action at the state and local level.
The choice here is a simple one.  President Obama has held up Costco as an example of a good jobs employer that is remarkably successful.  It pays its workers a decent wage with good benefits, doesn't reward its CEO obscene bonuses, and respects workers' rights.  In stark contrast, Walmart pays its workers so little that taxpayers end up paying billions to subsidize their low wages and lousy benefits. Clearly, the federal government should be standing on the side of good employers rather than rewarding exploitative ones that layoff part of their costs on taxpayers.
Last week's election showed that Americans are unhappy with a recovery that does not include them.  A Hart poll for the AFLCIO showed that more than four out of five voters (87 percent) reported that they were sinking or treading water in this economy.
Democrats paid the price for that discontent.  The big winners, even in red states like Arkansas and Nebraska, were initiatives to raise the minimum wage and guarantee sick leave.
Americans want action to make this economy work for working people.  With his historic agreement on carbon emissions with China, the president has made it clear he is prepared to act to move this country forward in vital areas.  He has made a similar commitment on immigration reform.  He should do the same on what he has called the "defining issue of our time": making this economy work for working people and not simply for the very few.
President Obama now faces a Republican Congress that has blocked any progress on the minimum wage, pay equity, paid family leave, and is intent on repealing health care reforms that have aided millions of low-wage workers. This leaves the president little choice. If progress is to be made, he must take the initiative.
Political support for the workers is building. The leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus wrote the president urging action, arguing, as Co-Chair Rep. Raul Grijalva put it, "The federal government must lead by example to move America beyond a low wage economy."  The CPC is collecting signatures for a petition to take to the president.  (To sign, go here.)
Over 20 organizations (including my own Campaign for America's Future) and an increasing number of prominent citizen leaders have joined together to endorse the measure while releasing a document: "More than the Minimum, The President's Unfinished Agenda," which lays out the case for action.
Earlier this week, Anna Greenberg reported on a poll done by Greenberg Associates of voters over Election Day.  With concerns about the "growing gap between the rich and everyone else" spread across party lines, more than three of four voters (77 percent) support requiring the federal government to give preference in contracting to "businesses that pay their employees a living wage, provide benefits such as healthcare and sick leave and respect worker rights."  More than half (53 percent) support this strongly, as opposed to 18 percent that oppose (8 percent strongly).   Even 60 percent of conservative republicans support the measure.
This isn't an abstract question.  Millions of workers will be lifted onto a road to the middle class immediately if the president acts.  And the president can demonstrate concretely what is imperative if we are to rebuild a broad middle class and revive the American dream: that government stand on the side of good employers and their workers rather than on the side of exploitative employers who force taxpayers to subsidize their employees.
The need is apparent.  The opportunity clear.  Americans across the political spectrum support action.  Workers are turning up the heat, even as they struggle to stay afloat.  It is time to act.

Is the next Battle of Mosul the fight in which U.S. troops will see combat in IraqBy Dan Lamothe November 13 Follow @danlamothe

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey appeared on Capitol Hill on Thursday, defending the U.S. strategy to defeat the Islamic State and President Obama’s decision last week to double the number of U.S. troops in Iraq to about 3,000. But Dempsey also talked about a daunting mission in which U.S. troops could see combat: taking back the city of Mosul.
“I’m not predicting, at this point, that I would recommend that those forces in Mosul and along the border would need to be accompanied by U.S. forces,” said Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. “But we’re certainly considering it.”
Dempsey left open the possibility Thursday that U.S. troops could eventually be involved in ground combat situations in Iraq. He has done so before, most notably at a September hearing in which he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that if it made sense to do so, he would recommend to Obama that U.S. military advisers join Iraqi troops on attacks on specific Islamic State targets.
Dempsey also has previously cited taking back Mosul as an example of a mission that might require additional U.S. support on the ground.

“If the Iraqi security forces and the [Peshmerga] were at some point ready to retake Mosul, a mission that I would find to be extraordinarily complex, it could very well be part of that particular mission to provide close combat advising or accompanying for that mission,” Dempsey told the Senate in September.
On Thursday, Dempsey said the United States can either choose to “take ownership” of the fight against the Islamic State entirely, and then eventually transition it to Iraqi troops, Pershmerga forces in northern Iraq, Sunni opposition and other partners. Or it can stay on its present course and “enable them and hold them accountable for the outcomes.”
Dempsey said any expansion to that strategy would be modest, and that he did not foresee circumstances in which it would be in U.S. interests “to take this fight on ourselves with a large military contingent.” But he left open the possibility for exceptions, especially if Iraqi troops are not willing to take back Anbar province in Iraq’s west or Nineveh province, which includes Mosul, the provincial capital.
“If those assumptions are rendered invalid, I will have to adjust my recommendations,” he said of the belief that Iraqi troops will take on the fight themselves once trained.
Last month, retired Gen. John Allen, the U.S. envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State, said in Baghdad that a major operation to take back Mosul would likely occur within the next year. He added that it would require a campaign, rather than a single fight, and would occur when the Iraqi military is ready.
In the meantime, Mosul remains under the control of the Islamic State, and many of its residents are in despair. Militants have looted homes, killed hundreds of people aligned with the government in Baghdad and triggered the collapse of the city’s economy, according to reports on the ground . Militants also have openly conducted military training within city limits.
The current debate about what to do occurs 10 years after the 2004 Battle of Mosul, in which the U.S. Army clashed with insurgents who had taken over large chunks of the city when a fierce attack led to the collapse of the city’s police force. Open preparations by the United States to take back the city of Fallujah in Anbar province may have prompted the increase in violence in Mosul, Army officials said later .

THE 3 WORDS THAT SAVED THE EUROTim Geithner: The 3 Words That Saved The Euro Were Ad-Libbed
Posted:
"Whatever it takes:" Those three words, uttered by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi in July 2012, are some of the most important words ever spoken in Europe's history. They may have rescued the European monetary union.
And they were ad-libbed.
That's the claim of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, according to a transcript of an interview he gave in preparation for his recent memoir . The transcript was obtained by the Financial Times , which first reported Geithner's claim about Draghi's remarks.
According to Geithner, when Draghi pledged in a speech in London to do "whatever it takes" to deal with Europe's sovereign-debt crisis and "preserve the euro," he was making it up as he went along. Draghi, Geithner says, hadn't cleared his line-in-the-sand statement with anyone before he made it and wasn't even sure what policies he could or would use to back it up.
Geithner, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment to The Huffington Post. An ECB representative also declined to comment.
This is, of course, only Geithner's version of events. The Telegraph's Ambrose Evans-Pritchard is skeptical . Evans-Pritchard writes that Draghi did consult with German officials –- the European Union's de facto center of gravity –- before announcing the bond-buying program that backed up his words a month later. A senior official at the German Finance Ministry even bragged a few weeks before Draghi's comments that “nothing flies in the eurozone right now without our permission.” That would seem to include ultimatums promising to ensure the integrity of the European Union itself.
The German Finance Ministry did not return a request for comment.
The German official's bluster could be just that, but there is a lot of truth to it. One of the main factors, if not the main factor, constraining Draghi's response to the European crisis was Germany's refusal to offer any aid to countries like Greece and Italy without harsh, often self-defeating terms.
If Geithner is correct, if Draghi really did spring his "whatever it takes" line without consulting the Germans, then Draghi was very clever to do so. It put the Germans in a box, forcing them to accept a public statement they likely would not have agreed to had it been pre-negotiated.
Things in Europe would have gotten much, much worse if Draghi had not made his statement. And Draghi likely knew that  there was a good chance he could make things better simply by making that statement, even if he had no plan to back up his words at the moment he uttered them.
Draghi's statement, and the bond-buying policy that followed , had a huge impact on the stability of European debt markets. Before, Spanish ten-year bonds were hitting yields of almost 8 percent . They've been dropping ever since and are now just above 2 percent .
The bond-buying plan Draghi used to back up his statement, known as Outright Monetary Transactions, or OMT, has worked despite never being enacted. Simply announcing that it existed -- not long after declaring that whatever the central bank did, "believe me, it will be enough" -- was enough to calm markets.
Draghi understood that saying "whatever it takes" would force recalcitrant policy makers to act and markets to recalibrate. It's what academics call a "performative utterance:" Saying it makes it so. It was smart, close-to-spontaneous politics. And it likely saved the European Union.

Asia slips in wake of soft data  oil stuck near lows2
"Shockingly, (China's) imports contracted by 6.7 percent year-on-year – their weakest performance since the Lehman crisis (except the volatile Lunar New Year-related period), said Dariusz Kowalczyk, economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.
"This is partly a reflection of lower commodity prices and base effects, but these two factors cannot fully explain the weak import number and we have to assume that poor domestic demand has played a part. This means that pressure will rise on the government to do more to stimulate growth," he said.
The Australian dollar, sensitive to the economic fortunes of of China, its main export destination, touched a new 4-1/2 year low of $0.8288 .
The disappointing Chinese and Japanese data contrasted sharply with Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls that showed employment in November surged by 321,000, easily topping forecasts for 230,000 new jobs.
The dollar was steady at 121.580 yen  after touching a new seven-year high of 121.860. The dollar index <.DXY> hovered near a 5-1/2 year high of 89.467.
A bullish dollar worked against crude oil, with the stronger greenback making commodities denominated in the U.S. currency less affordable for holders of other currencies.
U.S. crude  was down 77 cents at $65.07 a barrel, heading towards a five-year low of $63.72 struck a week ago, with a strong U.S. jobs report doing little to lift the bearish mood.
Some commentators focused on the positives of cheaper oil.
"The good news is that the fall in crude oil prices will provide well over two-thirds of the world's consumers with a windfall gain, particularly, the U.S., North Asian and Indian consumer. It is of modest help to Europe as well," Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies, said in a note to clients.
"This windfall gain ought to boost global GDP by around 0.5% for every US$20/barrel drop in oil prices (with a lag)."
The dollar stood tall against the euro, which languished near a two-year low of $1.2270 .
The euro and yen are expected to remain on the defensive against the dollar indefinitely as the strong U.S. jobs data  further contrasted the divergent monetary policy paths of the Fed and its European and Japanese counterparts which are mired   in underwhelming easing schemes.
While the Fed is seen to have moved a step nearer to hiking rates, the European Central Bank is under pressure to enhance its stimulus programme while the Bank of Japan remains far from reaching its inflation target.

Facebook again tries to simplify privacy policyInfosys founders, including Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, seeking $1.1 bn via stake sale: Source
One more time, Facebook is trying to simplify its lengthy privacy policy and make it much shorter to explain how it targets advertisements to its 1.35 billion users.
The world’s largest online social network uses the information people share on its site, along with the apps they use and the outside websites they visit, to show them advertisements deemed relevant to them.
In the July-September quarter, Facebook reported nearly USD 3 billion in advertising revenue, a 64 percent increase from a year earlier.
Over the years, the company has faced concerns from users and from government regulators and privacy advocates that its policies are too complicated. Two years ago, it settled with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that it exposed details about their users’ lives without getting the required legal consent.
Last year, an independent audit that was part of the settlement found its privacy practices sufficient.
Despite criticisms, Facebook is rare among Internet companies in that it seeks user input on its privacy policy and tries to put it in plain English. But it also has a vast trove of data about its users that it uses to show ads and measure how well they work, among other things.
Today, Facebook introduced a tool called “Privacy Basics,” a set of animated, interactive guides designed to show users how to control what they share on the site. Tips answer questions such as “How do I delete something I post on Facebook?” or “What do people who aren’t my friends see when they search for me?”
It also proposed changes to its terms and privacy policy, which it calls its data policy. The new policy is much shorter and lays out how Facebook collects data and what it does with it, among other things, in illustrated subsections.
Users will have seven days until November 20 to comment on the new policy and the final version will go into effect soon after that.
The move comes as Facebook is testing a tool that lets users buy things through its site, and ramps up its ad targeting based on users’ location.
The new policy ensures that if people use Facebook to make a purchase, their credit card information will be collected, for example. Meanwhile, the location information Facebook collects might include where you took a photo that you share on the site, or the location of your mobile device using GPS, Bluetooth or WiFi signals.
A recent Pew Research Centre poll found that some 80 percent of Americans who use social networking sites are concerned about third parties, such as advertisers, accessing data that they share on the sites.

G-20 summit to be test of forum s staying power...KRISTEN GELINEAU and STEPHEN WRIGHT | November 14, 2014 02:13 AM EST | Associated Press
BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — The annual G-20 leadership summit that groups democrats with authoritarians and rich nations with poor has long suffered from a perception it's all talk and no action. This year, leaders are under extra pressure to produce something tangible.
The global forum is regarded as having been at its most successful during its first summit in 2008 when an alarming financial crisis that was nursed into being on Wall Street rippled around the world, toppling giant banks and casting tens of millions out of work.
Since then, the gathering has been criticized as having produced a lot of lofty goals, but little follow-through despite its member countries representing about 85 percent of the global economy.
Prompting pressure for tangible results at the Group of 20's Brisbane summit this weekend, experts say, are comments from the International Monetary Fund warning about a "new mediocre" for the global economy, with Europe teetering on the brink of recession, China's growth slowing and Japan in a malaise.
"What the world really needs is a little burst of confidence," said Mike Callaghan, Program Director of the G20 Studies Center at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. "There is the pressure on the G-20 to provide signs of confidence that the countries are cooperating together."
One concrete measure of the G-20's success could come from its previously announced goal of creating tens of millions of new jobs by adding $2 trillion to global GDP over five years.
Prior summits have shied away from setting such targets because of concerns that the G-20's credibility could be attacked if the targets were not achieved.
Australia, as this year's chair of the G-20, has been determined to give the forum new relevance, an outcome that would burnish its credentials and image on the world stage.
But details of exactly how the nations will reach the growth target remain sketchy.
Australian Treasurer and summit host Joe Hockey said the group agreed to focus on growth led by private business and industry, particularly from additional investment in infrastructure, to get the job done. Each country is expected to present a comprehensive growth strategy at the summit.
A challenge, however, is that the goals require implementation over many years and that requires prolonged political momentum.
"When you're all facing an immediate crisis, it's a lot easier to focus the mind and be able to agree on what you need to do," Callaghan said.
"In Brisbane, what is invariably needed is some good evidence that these major countries are actually cooperating to improve the global outlook and it isn't just talk."
A second barrier is the widely divergent interests of countries in a club that includes a superpower, the United States; giant but very poor states such as India and governments that are often at loggerheads with each other such as China and Japan.
Joseph Cheng, a political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong, said it will be crucial for the G-20 to put in a place a reporting system that allows the progress of each country to be measured.
He said that could allow for "public opinion pressure" on the countries that deviate from the targets and is the "real important issue" at stake during the weekend summit.

Sister Abhaya case: Two lab techniciansacquittedSister Abhaya was found dead in 1992
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: November 15, 2014 1:25 am
The Chief Judicial Magistrate Court in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday acquitted two former staff members of the Chemical Examination Lab in connection with the case pertaining to the alleged tampering of the chemical analysis report in the murder case of Catholic nun Abhaya in 1992.
Then chief chemical examiner R Geetha and then chemical analyst M Chitra have now been acquitted in the case, registered in 2007.  The case followed a complaint from activist Jomon Puthenpurackal, who had relied upon a newspaper report that the work book register pertaining to the examination of internal organs of Abhaya was tampered with to cover up that the nun was raped before being murdered.
The CJM found that the charges against the alleged accused were untenable.
The nun’s body was found in her convent well in Kottayam in March 1992.
The issue related to the tampering of the chemical examination workbook came up in 2007.  The case related to the tampering gave a fresh impetus for the probe into the mysterious death of the nun. A year later, in 2008, the CBI had arrested two priests and a nun in the Abhaya murder case in 2008, in a different case.
According the complainant, the manuscript of the workbook report at the laboratory pertaining to chemical examinations of Abhaya’s vaginal swabs and smear had shown corrections in four places. Referring to the presence of semen in the swabs, the word “detected” and the word “not” added.
The court acted swiftly and ordered the police to seize the original work register, which was sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad to examine whether the register was manipulated or not. The CFSL had found that the workbook was tampered with. Subsequently, the court framed charges against lab officials Geetha and Chitra. They were slapped with conspiracy, forgery and tampering.
Whereas the stand of the alleged accused was it was a usual practice at the laboratory to enter preliminary findings in the register. If required, the preliminary entries would be corrected during the detailed examination and necessary corrections made in the final report.
Geetha and Chitra said they were relieved from seven years of torture. “Some vested interests in the office might have worked against us. Otherwise, why was the issue was raked up in 2007, 15 years after we prepared the chemical report,” they asked.

Bombay HC stays job quota for Marathas  says community notbackwardPrint
Written by Aamir Khan | Mumbai | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:43 pm | Updated: November 15, 2014 1:30 am
The Bombay High Court on Friday stayed the ordinance brought in by the previous Congress government in the state to provide reservation \to the Maratha community in government jobs and educational institutions.
The order came while the court was hearing a bunch of petitions contesting the state Cabinet’s decision on July 9, reserving 16 per cent seats in government jobs and educational institutions for Marathas and five per cent seats for Muslims.
The total reservation in the state had thereby gone up to 73 per cent.
The Bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice M S Sonak also stayed five per cent quota for Muslims in government jobs but allowed reservation in educational institutions, except private ones, citing “abysmally low” educational achievements.
The court made it clear that those already given reservation will not be disturbed till the final outcome of the case. It observed that Marathas “were not” a backward community and the state did not have the power to exceed the 50 per cent reservation limit set by the Supreme Court.
In extraordinary cases, the reservation may exceed 50 per cent given the same is justified by the state, the bench said. Shortly after the court order, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said his government will appeal in the Supreme Court. “My government is committed to reservation for the Maratha community. If there are certain discrepancies in the law pointed by the High Court, we will take measures to make the necessary corrections. The lacuna will be addressed to ensure that the quota for the Maratha community comes into force,” he said.
The state had earlier filed an affidavit justifying its decision to offer reservation to the Maratha community, contending that reservation had been given twice to them in the pre-independence era but were withdrawn after independence.
The affidavit contended that 16 per cent reservation for the community was made on the basis of “compelling and quantifiable” data. “Even in the decision-making process it is clearly mentioned that earlier in the year 1902 as well as 1942 reservation was provided to the Maratha community as backward class but thereafter in the post-independence era such reservation was withdrawn. This resulted in educational, social and economic backwardness of the community and, therefore, prima facie, reservation is justified,” the state had said in its affidavit.
Social activist Ketan Tirodkar, who was the first to move a PIL against the state’s decision in June, had claimed that 85 per cent of the sugar factories in the state were “owned/controlled by Marathas”. In addition, 75 per cent and more land is owned by the Maratha community in the state and more than 72 per cent of co-operative institutions are controlled by Marathas, he had said.

DDA misses deadline due to  technical glitchesDDA misses deadline due to 'technical glitches'

For the applicants of Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing scheme 2014, the wait for the lucky draw is turning out to be an endless one.
DDA's draw of lots which was formerly scheduled for November 5 has already been rescheduled twice, with DDA missing the latest deadline it had set for itself- November 14. They have been attributing the delay to technical glitches. (HT Photo)
The draw of lots, which was initially scheduled to be held on November 5, was postponed to November 10 after delay in the processing of applications, which was again rescheduled for November 14, according to DDA vice-chairman Balvinder Kumar.
DDA has been carrying out trial runs of the draw since Monday and facing technical glitches. This has resulted in the delay, leading DDA to miss the latest deadline it had set for itself.
 
The trial runs, or ‘mock draw’ are being jointly carried out by the Systems department of DDA and a team from C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) at the DDA headquarter Vikas Sadan, where the draw is going to be held.
Applicants can visit the DDA website to check their applications online and in case of any discrepancy in the details submitted, they can report these directly to the Director (Systems), DDA at 011-24694157 to get the errors rectified
 
“The C-DAC team has brought all the required hardware to DDA headquarter, and along with our systems officials are working almost 24X7 to ensure a smooth draw of lots,” said a senior DDA official.
“The problem is the huge number of applications and the large number of errors that crept into the forms that were submitted by applicants with designated banks."
 
DDA has received total 10,08,700 applications for the 25,034 flats on offer, most of which are one bedroom flats.
 
“The trial runs are going on and is taking a lot of time because there is a lot of data to be processed. We have been facing some technical glitches too,” said DDA vice-chairman Kumar.
“The mock draws are taking six to seven hours to complete because there are so many forms and so many categories, while we want to wrap up the draw between one to two hours,” he said.
 
“The software we are using is a bit old but the systems department feels it is safe and time tested and don’t want to change it,” added Kumar.

For House  9th pipeline bill may be the charm...and
versions
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-controlled House passed legislation Friday approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline, setting the stage for a Senate showdown that mixes energy politics with a fight over Louisiana's Senate seat.
The vote was 252-161 in favor of the bill, which was sponsored by Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., in an effort to boost his chances to take Louisiana's Senate seat away from Democrat Mary Landrieu. The two are headed for a Dec. 6 runoff and have been touting their energy credentials in their oil and gas-producing state.
Landrieu, who is facing an uphill battle to retain her seat, successfully pushed the Democratic-run Senate to hold a vote on the measure next week.
The bill was supported by 221 Republicans, and not a single GOP lawmaker voted against it. Thirty-one Democrats also backed the bill, while 161 rejected it.
"This will make it easier for the Senate to do right by the American people and finally vote on building the pipeline," Cassidy said in a statement after the vote, which marked the ninth time the House had passed a bill to speed up the pipeline's construction.
The project has been stalled by environmental reviews, by objections to the route it would take and by politics for six years. But the latest bid by House Republicans has the best chance of reaching President Barack Obama's desk. While the White House has issued veto threats on similar legislation before, it had yet to do so Friday.
Advocates say it will create thousands of jobs and aid energy security, but environmentalists warn of possible spills and say the pipeline will expedite development of some of the dirtiest oil available.
The State Department said in a Jan. 31 report that the project would not significantly boost carbon emissions because the oil was likely to find its way to market by other means. It added that transporting it by rail or truck would cause greater environmental problems than if the Keystone XL pipeline were built.
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said it was time for the president to listen to the American people, especially after Republican gains in last week's midterm elections, and sign the bill.
"The president doesn't have any more elections to win, and he has no other excuse for standing in the way," Boehner said.
Senate supporters said they were confident they would have the 60 votes needed for passage come Tuesday. All 45 Senate Republicans are expected to back the legislation, but supporters have yet to publicly identify all of the Democrats who they say will vote for the measure.
Obama, questioned about the issue while traveling on the other side of the globe, said the administration's long-stalled review of the project cannot be completed before knowing the outcome of a legal challenge to the pipeline's route through Nebraska.
"I don't think we should short-circuit that process," he said at a news conference in Myanmar.
The 1,179-mile project is proposed to go from Canada through Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska, where it would connect with existing pipelines to carry more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast.

Japan GDP data make-or-break for snap election... 
ELAINE KURTENBACH | November 14, 2014 03:27 AM EST | Associated Press
TOKYO (AP) — The release Monday of Japan's quarterly economic data, normally a routine event, is getting far more attention than usual: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to make the dour GDP reading the basis for calling a snap election.
Abe wants a renewed mandate as he weighs delaying a sales tax increase that is crucial to getting Japan's battered government finances into better shape. It would be the second of two planned tax hikes. The first, in April, sent the world's third-largest economy into a tailspin.
Putting off the tax hike slated for next year carries some risk that financial markets may doubt Japan's resolve to restore its ailing public finances. After many years of deficit spending the total public debt is more than twice the size of the economy and the largest among developed nations.
But Abe and his advisers appear to view the threat to Japan's recovery, which has limped along since the April 1 increase in the sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent, as the more urgent risk.
Economists are forecasting the economy grew about 2 percent in the July-September quarter, a weak rebound after contracting 7.1 percent from a year earlier in the previous quarter.
The April tax hike's blow to consumer and corporate spending has been less severe than one in 1997 that is blamed for pushing Japan into a perpetual slump. But its dampening effects on corporate and consumer were harsher and lingered longer than expected.
Abe has previously said he would decide on the next tax hike after the Dec. 8 release of a revised GDP figure, but a spate of political funding scandals and a dip in his own popularity ratings appear to be hurrying things along.
So do numerous surveys showing over 70 percent of the public in favor of putting off a tax hike until later than next October.
"Everyone understands that we have to raise the tax one day," said Masamichi Adachi, an economist at JP Morgan in Tokyo.
"But politically speaking it looks wise to postpone the painful decision," he said.
A decision on the tax hike and on a snap election could come as early as Tuesday, and both ruling party and opposition lawmakers have begun campaign preparations, even though Abe and his spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, have refused to say what he plans to do.
As prime minister and head of the ruling Liberal Democrat Party, Abe can call an election whenever he wants up until December 2016. Holding a vote next month puts the opposition, already vastly outnumbered by the ruling coalition LDP and New Komeito, at a disadvantage.
The leading opposition group, the Democratic Party of Japan, is in disarray after their defeat in 2012, with public support ratings below 10 percent, or about a quarter of the Liberal Democrats'.
In stalling the tax hike, Abe would be defying the powerful Finance Ministry.
Finance Minister Taro Aso, in a finance committee meeting in parliament this week, said that without some other increase in tax revenues, delivering on promises to improve finances while putting off the sales tax hike would be "extremely tough."
In the same session, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said he expected the sales tax to be raised in October 2015 as planned. He said an Oct. 31 surprise expansion in the central bank's monetary easing was meant to help the economy weather another tax increase.
The BOJ's Halloween surprise coincided with a long-anticipated announcement the same day that the government pension fund is shifting a larger share of its investments into shares and out of government bonds.
Those two measures boosted share prices to seven-year highs. If it continues, the boom in share trading could mollify the Finance Ministry and also nudge cash-rich corporations to raise wages, helping to support a more sustainable recovery.

Airbus earns drop on loss-making A380... 
November 14, 2014 03:25 AM EST | Associated Press
PARIS (AP) — Airbus says its net profit slumped in the third quarter as it delivered more of its loss-making A380 superjumbos.
The European jet maker reported net profit of 264 million euros ($328 million) in the July to September quarter, down 41 percent from 445 million euros a year earlier.
Airbus delivered nine of its A380 superumbo jets in the quarter, up from four a year earlier. The A380 remains loss-making seven years after the first of the 525-seater jets entered service in 2007, and Airbus has delivered 144 of them since then.
In a statement Friday Airbus also warned that its A400M military transport aircraft program is being reviewed due to "negative cost and risk evolution," and that the financial impact would be disclosed in its full-year accounts.

Subsidy burden for Indian oil cosSave this video

Despite the 8 per cent fall last week, the stock of gas transmitter GAIL (India) is up 43 per cent over the last year. The rally has been driven primarily by prospects of a lower subsidy burden due to the gradual rise in diesel prices and their eventual decontrol. GAIL has been bearing about 1.5 per cent of the under-recoveries incurred by Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL from selling diesel, LPG and kerosene below cost.

Tarnished victory in Maharashtra
state politics
Ahead of its floor test in the Maharashtra Assembly, it was clear that the 13-day-old Devendra Fadnavis-led government would win its vote of confidence , even though with 122 MLAs the BJP was 22 short of a majority. The 41-member-strong Nationalist Congress Party had indicated from the start that it would abstain from voting, an act that, by reducing the effective strength of the House, would have ensured the BJP government a safe passage. By the time voting day came, the NCP had gone a step further in agreeing to vote for the government, and that would have given it a margin of 19 votes. Yet, on Wednesday the BJP chose to allow its victory to be tarnished — even undermined — by refusing to agree to a division, or an actual head-count: instead, despite vociferous protests by members of the Congress and the Shiv Sena, some of whom entered the well of the Assembly, the minority BJP government won its confidence motion through a voice vote. The question then arises: if the BJP could have anyway won through actual counting of heads, why would it opt for a voice vote, one that has much less legitimacy, and that too at the very start of a five-year term?
It is hard to believe that the BJP, buoyed by the continuing popular sentiment in its favour, lacked the confidence to go for an actual vote. More plausible is that the BJP did not wish to be seen as taking support from the NCP, a party that it targeted sharply not just through the election campaign but in the years that it was in the opposition, for gross acts of corruption. If the NCP, that had presided over the Irrigation Ministry for a decade, for instance, was seen as responsible for a financial scandal that reportedly ran into thousands of crores of rupees, forcing NCP leader Ajit Pawar to resign from the post of Deputy Chief Minister, there were other scams that NCP leaders such as Sunil Tatkare and Chhagan Bhujbal were accused of. For the BJP to be seen now as taking support from a party that has been so closely associated with graft in the name of providing a “stable” government, its leaders possibly felt, would cast a shadow over its promise of providing good governance and a clean and transparent administration. But, in the weeks ahead, the Fadnavis government could find it hard focussing on the job at hand, with the Sena accusing it of “strangling democracy” and the Congress warning that it would not allow any business in the Assembly to be conducted till the government obtains a fresh trust vote, and threatening to bring a no-confidence motion against newly-elected Speaker Haribhau Bagade who overruled the demand for division. The new government may have to face a vote on the Governor’s Address, for which it will have to marshal its forces again. Clearly, not a propitious beginning.

Raghuram Rajan Keeps Promise, Speaks in Hindi at RBI Function
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 13, 2014 22:16 (IST)
Arvind Subramanian Likely to Be Chief Economic Adviser
Mumbai: A year after promising to address the audience in Hindi, RBI Governor Dr Raghuram Rajan on Thursday walked the talk and delivered his keynote address in the official language at a function.
"It has become an integral part of customer service to work in Hindi in the changing economic scenario. That is the reason the RBI is always with you for promoting Hindi and other vernacular languages," he said.
Dr Rajan was speaking at the RBI headquarters while giving away the 'Rajbhasha Shield' awards for 2012-13 to the banking sector stakeholders this evening.
Last year addressing the award ceremony, Dr Rajan, who has spent most of his life outside India, had promised to speak in Hindi at the next Rajbhasha function, which was held today.
"Hindi and other languages in the country are like a bridge between the banker and the customer. This is the reason private banks are also using Hindi, although the Rajbhasha policy is not applicable to them," Dr Rajan said in Hindi and appeared at ease while speaking in the language.
Dr Rajan, a former chief economist at IMF, took over as the RBI Governor in September last year.

Oil Slumps to 4-year Low as Brent Crashes Below $80 a BarrelBrent Falls Below $69 as Price Rout Rolls On
New York: Oil prices slumped more than 3 per cent to four-year lows on Thursday, with benchmark Brent crashing below $80 a barrel, after a stockpile surge at the delivery point for US crude frayed nerves of traders already worried about an oil glut.
The decline compounded Wednesday's losses stemming from comments by Saudi Arabia's oil minister that showed little will by the kingdom to cut output when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27.
Brent settled down $2.46, or 3.1 per cent, at $77.92 a barrel, after plumbing a September 2010 low of $77.83.
US crude finished down $2.97, or 3.9 per cent, at $74.21. In post-settlement trade, it went as low as $74.07, also a trough from September 2010.
Futures of US gasoline blendstock RBOB and heating oil fell to four-year lows too, with gasoline breaching the $2-per-gallon mark.
Crude prices, which have slumped some 30 per cent since June on fears of an oversupplied market, plunged below support levels of $80 a barrel for Brent and $75 for US crude.
Some market analysts think US crude is on course to break below $70 a barrel.
"Certainly, $70 seems to be the next major target to take out," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Texas. "There is little in the way of market bears clawing toward that."
The losses came after the US government's Energy Information Administration said stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for US crude futures rose 1.7 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 7. Gasoline stocks surged 1.8 million barrels.
Some thought the selloff was overdone as the market appeared to have overlooked an overall drop of 1.7 million barrels in crude inventories. There was also a 2.8 million-barrel draw in distillate stocks, which included heating oil, and a spike in refinery utilization.
"To me, the market's reaction confirms just how bearish sentiment is. Even with decent numbers like these, the market can't rally," said Kyle Cooper, managing director at energy consultancy IAF Advisors in Houston.
OPEC members meet in Vienna on Nov. 27, when they will consider how to respond to the price slump over the past five months. Some have said they want a cut in output.
Qatar expects to lower oil output to about 500,000 bpd by the end of November from 650,000 bpd at the end of October and from 800,000 a month before that, an industry source familiar with the matter said.
But top oil exporter and OPEC's most powerful member, Saudi Arabia, has refrained from backing a cut, prompting speculation that it is more concerned with keeping market share than supporting prices.
"We do not set the oil price. The market sets the prices," Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Wednesday.

US President Barack Obama has commended the personal leadership role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in finding a forward path on the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA).
"The President had extensive discussions with the Prime Minister Modi on this issue and appreciates his personal leadership in finding a path forward ," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement after India and the US announced that the two countries have reached an agreement on TFA.
In Myanmar, where the US President met Modi briefly on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit in Nay Pyi Taw described the Prime Minister as a man of action.
In a statement, Earnest said the important breakthrough reached between the US and India will unlock progress toward the full and immediate implementation of the WTO TFA, which will lower the costs of trade for developed and developing countries alike.
"This breakthrough will also strengthen the multilateral trading system and give a boost to its ongoing work, including in the area of food security," he said.
Combined with the recent announcement of a breakthrough on the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and the agreement among Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Leaders that the end of those landmark negotiations is coming into focus, this has been a good week for expanding opportunities for American businesses and workers and for promoting growth around the globe, Earnest said.

The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex surged to a new high, rising over 106 points to close at 28,046.66 after easing wholesale (or WPI) inflation, which cooled to a 5-year low in October, strengthened hopes of a rate cut while good earnings from bluechips like SBI boosted the sentiment.
Besides, robust buying by overseas investors and tumbling crude oil prices supported the strong momentum in stocks.

Tiger on the loose near Paris; people advised to stay indoorsTiger on the loose near Paris; people advised to stay indoors

Montevrain, France, November 14, 2014

A tiger remained on the loose near Paris early Friday after firefighters and police called off the search for the night following a fruitless all-day hunt, with worried residents told to stay indoors.
A local woman sounded the alarm the morning of the previous day after spotting the fearsome animal in a supermarket car park in the town of Montevrain -- just a stone's throw from Disneyland Paris.
Several more people later came forward saying they had seen the tiger on the prowl.

Backed up by a helicopter, more than 100 police officers and firefighters armed with tranquilising guns had spent the day combing the area in the Seine-et-Marne district near the French capital, without success.
Authorities ordered residents to stay indoors and use cars to pick their children up from school.
Town hall official Cedric Tartaud-Gineste told AFP: "We are calling on residents to be careful, not to leave their homes and to stay in their vehicles."
"Anyone who sees the tiger should call the police or the fire service."
He said that a security cordon covering an area about the size of four or five football pitches had been set up around a wooded area near the small town of Montevrain, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) east of Paris.
Experts said there was little doubt that the animal on the loose was a tiger.Watch: Police hunt for Tiger on the loose near Paris
"There is no doubt, it's a tiger," Robert Picaud, the head of a local group responsible for regulating pests, and who took part in the search.
"The footprints are real and they were not made by a man. These prints and photos leave no room for doubt."
Police were also using thermal cameras in a bid to find the big cat, estimated to weigh around 70 kilogrammes (155 pounds), according to the town's mayor Christian Robache.
A dog trained in tracking bears and large game was also brought in to help with the search effort.
As darkness fell, officials suspended the search until daybreak.
"The hunt will be suspended for the night until dawn. The helicopter equipped with a thermal camera will keep going," said a local police source.
 
'I think I saw a lynx'
 
Earlier Thursday, an AFP reporter saw around a dozen fire engines and police vehicles lined up near the supermarket where the tiger was first spotted.
"My wife saw it this morning," Jean-Baptiste Berdeaux, who manages the Intermarche supermarket, told AFP.
"She didn't get out of the car and called me to say 'I think I saw a lynx'," he said, adding she took a photo of the animal and the couple then alerted nearby police officers.
Some people playing tennis nearby also saw the animal sloping by.
Authorities said they were hoping to catch the tiger alive.
"If it's possible, we'll try and put it to sleep. If it becomes dangerous or aggressive, the order will be given to kill it," police said.
A police source said the animal's prints were found in the woodland.
It was as yet unclear where the animal came from.
Despite the town's proximity to Disneyland Paris, a source close to the investigation said there was no link to the theme park.
Authorities have also made enquiries at a big-cat wildlife park 30 kilometres away.
Suspicion initially fell on a circus that had set up its tent in the supermarket car park a few days ago, but the mayor said it "did not have a tiger".
A source close to the search operation said the hunt for any tiger would be made more difficult because if the big cat behaved in typical fashion, it would nap a lot, possibly spending hours unnoticed sleeping in a tree.
The PETA animal rights group called on authorities to "show restraint and compassion in dealing with this tiger on the loose".
"This situation, however upsetting, is entirely preventable and should serve as a wake-up call to the public about the perils of keeping wild animals in captivity," the group told AFP in a statement.

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Budget carrier IndiGo has announced special fares starting as low as Rs 1,647 (all-inclusive) on select destinations. Tickets for this advance fare scheme must be must be purchased at least 90 days prior to departure.

IndiGo's scheme comes in the wake of a similar offer from rival Jet Airways. Jet Airways has announced special fares starting as low as Rs 1,973 (all-inclusive) on select destinations. This offer is valid on economy class travel within India.
Tickets for this Jet Airways' advance fare scheme must be must be purchased at least 90 days prior to departure. And the booking for this special Jet Airways offer is open till March 31, 2015.
Other airlines have also periodically launched advance fare schemes. This has seen passenger traffic rising in recent months. In September, domestic airlines saw a 28 per cent growth in passenger traffic as compared to a year earlier.
Domestic budget airline SpiceJet has also been at the forefront of announcing promotional schemes to attract flyers. Speaking to NDTV Profit, Sanjiv Kapoor, chief operating officer of SpiceJet, had earlier said the airline has seen a bump-up in passenger traffic, whenever it has launched such schemes.
Explaining the rationale for launching such schemes, Mr Kapoor said, "We don't like to fly empty planes. Once a plane takes off that empty seat is lost forever."
By selling excess capacity in advance, through advance fare schemes, "we are trying to get rid of excess capacity early so that close to the date to the departure we are leaving with much fuller capacity" the SpiceJet executive added.
 

Kumar Mangalam Birla planning foray into e-commAditya Birla Group
(The chairman of the $40 bn Aditya Birla group…)
MUMBAI: Kumar Mangalam Birla is the latest billionaire with plans to enter the burgeoning Indian online market that is set to grow sevenfold in four years.
The chairman of the $40-billion Aditya Birla group is open to either acquiring e-retailers or building one from scratch, Birla said in a November 10 interview at his Mumbai corporate headquarters. "There's a lot of ground for new ventures in e-commerce," he said. "I am not saying that we can take an Amazon head-on. But there are a lot of green spaces."
Surging internet access in the world's fastest growing smartphone market is buoying online shopping and luring investors including Amazon.com's Jeffrey Bezos and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son . SoftBank last month announced an investment of $627 million in Indian e-retailer Snapdeal.com, while Amazon said in July that it plans to spend $2 billion in India.
Birla, 47, joins peer Mukesh Ambani , whose Reliance Industries is planning to start "multi-channel shopping in the coming year," according to its annual report published in May ."The potential of e-commerce combined with the network of physical store locations" will offer its customers both choice and convenience, the report said.
Birla declined to reveal more on his e-commerce plans. The group is looking at many business verticals and has "not zeroed-in on any" specific one yet, he said.
Online sales in Asia's third-largest economy will jump sevenfold to $22 billion by 2018, according to estimates by CLSA Asia Pacific Markets.
Snapdeal runs an ecommerce marketplace where about 50,000 sellers offer a wide range of goods, from condoms to apparel and shoes.

Brent edges below $78  still near 4-year low...Ali Al-Naimi
(Brent crude held near a four-year…)
SINGAPORE: Brent crude held near a four-year low below $78 a barrel on Friday amid concerns over excess supply and uncertainty over whether OPEC would cut output at a meeting in two weeks.
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi appeared to rule out a cut in output but other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are pushing for action to tackle the fall in prices when they meet in Vienna on Nov. 27. Oil prices have plunged 30 per cent since June.
Brent has dropped for eight weeks in a row, its longest weekly losing streak since records began in 1988, based on Reuters data. It has lost nearly 7 percent so far this week.
"We've got a period of very heightened volatility in the lead-up to the Nov. 27 OPEC meeting," said Mark Keenan, head of commodities research in Asia at Societe Generale in Singapore .
Brent futures rose 10 cents to $77.59 a barrel as of 0605 GMT. The December contract expired on Thursday, settling down $2.46 at $77.92 after touching an intraday low of $77.83, lowest since September 2010.
US crude for December delivery fell 36 cents to $73.85 a barrel after closing down $2.97, or almost 4 percent, on Thursday.
"Prices are in freefall. The market is saying OPEC won't do anything," said Jonathan Barratt , chief investment officer at Sydney's Ayers Alliance . "But nobody is talking about winter and I think that will be the turning point. A few cold snaps will be an opportunity for people to get in and hedge."
Adding to oil glut worries, crude stocks at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub climbed by a larger-than-expected 1.7 million barrels last week, the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration said.
But US crude stockpiles fell 1.7 million barrels in the week to Nov. 7, against analysts' expectations of a 750,000 barrel build in inventories, the EIA said.
The market was also keeping an eye on geopolitical issues.
The 120,000 barrel-a-day Hariga oil port in eastern Libya has reopened after state security guards ended a protest over unpaid wages, a port source said on Thursday, but the El Sharara oil field remains shut.

Peter Lynch's top six investing tips everyone must follow

(When it comes to investing…)
When it comes to investing in stock markets , investors usually get trapped between logic and sentiment. They tend to take decisions based on herd mentality and sometime they become clueless about the future course of the stock market. This situation leads to bad investment decisions.
"Sometimes having good knowledge may not be sufficient to earn good rewards from the market if the basics are forgotten. These basics, if followed, can help an investor hold his ground even in a difficult market situation and hence create wealth in future. Even world-renowned investors would not have earned that respect in the market, had they not followed the basic fundamentals of investing. One of those investors was Peter Lynch," says Nitin Vyakaranam, founder & CEO of ArthaYantra, an online financial planning firm.
Peter Lynch in fact was known for the consistent returns he generated for his investors at Fidelity's Magellan Mutual Fund. "When he started overseeing the portfolio of Magellan in 1977, the fund was less known and had only $18 million in assets. Magellan's assets were managed by Lynch from 1977 to 1990. During these thirteen years, the compounded average annual investment return generated by him was close to thirty percent," says Vyakaranam.
Lynch's success depended on his ability to adapt to different investment styles and go with whatever worked at that time. Even if his styles of investment differed with the changing times, his fundamental checklist remained constant. At an investment conference in New York in 2005, Lynch shared his checklist.
It may a good idea to revisit these checks to help our own perspective about investments:
1. Don't buy anything you don't know
Lynch desired to know everything about the company and carried out his ground checks before investing in it. He also advocated investing in companies which one is familiar with or whose business is relatively easy to understand. In the words of the legend himself, "investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards."
2. Before you purchase, explain why you are buying it
The reasons for our purchase should never be based only on someone else's suggestions. In order to explain why you are buying something, you need to know what you are buying.
3. It is futile to predict the economy and the interest rates
One needs to cut market noise and concentrate on core fundamentals when selecting investment options. Lynch said that "if you spend more than 13 minutes analyzing economic and market forecasts, you've wasted 10 minutes."
4. Good management is important- buy good businesses
Lynch invested in the 'story' a company has to offer. What a company is going to do to deliver the desired results formed the crux of his investment decisions. If a company has a business that anyone can relate to and the management has a clear plan to deliver expectations, then this check is cleared.
5. Be flexible and humble and learn from mistakes
No one is perfect. Not living in a self-denial that our bad investment choices will someday turn good is a humble start.
6. There is always something to worry about
Investments are subjected to various risks and market conditions. No investment plan can curtail all the risks. One can only mitigate risk to achieve higher degree of success with one's investments. While picking securities, Peter Lynch stuck to what he knew or could easily understand. He mostly invested for the long run and was unfazed by short-term market volatility. Buying good business at reasonable price was his mantra. In order to pick good business, he turned as many stones as possible to spot the hidden gems.
"Attempt to understand the Peter Lynch approach to investing. You will realize that a share is not a lottery ticket, but a part-ownership to a business," observes Vyakaranam.

How did Kunal Ghosh get sedatives in jail No clarity yetComments
Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh, an accused in the multi-crore Saradha scam, took 26 sleeping pills in an alleged suicide bid inside the Kolkata jail where he has been locked up for the past year.
Kunal Ghosh, the CEO of the erstwhile media houses run by Saradha Group, had threatened suicide in front of a judge on Monday unless the influential people named in the scam were not arrested within 72 hours. (PTI Photo)
Ghosh, who was the CEO of Saradha’s media wing at the time the Ponzi scheme at the company unravelled, was rushed to hospital where doctors said his condition was stable.
The one-time close confidant of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had threatened this week to end his life if the CBI failed to take action against others involved in the scam.
Jail authorities filed an FIR against Ghosh as attempted suicide is a criminal offence.
"According to a complaint lodged by jail authorities, a case has been registered against Kunal Ghosh u/s section 309 of IPC," said Rajeev Mishra, joint commissioner (headquarters) of Kolkata Police.
A hospital official said Ghosh told doctors in the emergency department that he had consumed 26 pills.
“A six-member medical board has been formed to treat him. He is stable now. The team will decide when to discharge him,” said Pradip Mitra, director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research. “The contents of his stomach have been sent for forensic test.”
Prison officials failed to explain how the suspended Trinamool Congress leader managed to procure the sedatives despite being lodged in a high-security cell at the Presidency jail with two guards keeping watch.
“He was extremely depressed even during the last hearing (on Monday). We informed the court too. It is surprising how sedatives find their way inside the jail,” said Ghosh's lawyer, Soumyajit Raha.
Three letters were found in Ghosh's jail cell, sources said. One was addressed to the Chief Justice of India, another to the chief justice of the Calcutta High Court and the third to Saradha investors.
The chief minister suspended the jail superintendent as well as the doctor and nurse on duty while the state government set up a committee to probe the incident.
The incident triggered a torrent of questions from opposition leaders who said there could be a conspiracy to eliminate Ghosh by the real architects of the scam.
“If Kunal dies who will benefit? They will be senior Trinamool Congress leaders against whom he has been spilling the beans for a long time. People will take this incident as a conspiracy,” said senior state Congress leader Abdul Mannan.
The Saradha scam has turned into a major embarrassment for Trinamool chief Banerjee who has been accused by opposition parties of trying to shield some of the beneficiaries of the company’s slush funds.
The scam was caused by the collapse of an investment operation from the Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private firms that was running many unlicensed financial schemes in eastern India.
The group folded up in April last year, resulting in the loss of hundreds of crores to thousands of investors — largely from rural areas with little access to banking facilities.
During a court hearing in September, Ghosh said he was being unjustly kept behind bars while bigger beneficiaries of the scam were inaugurating community Durga Puja ceremonies.
Early on Friday, a guard deployed outside Ghosh’s cell saw the MP unconscious and informed jail officials. The local police were called and Ghosh was taken to hospital.

PM Modi likely to raise black money issue at G20 meet in AustraliaModi may raise black money issue at G20 meet
PTI  Brisbane, November 14, 2014

As India's attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad continues, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will push for stepping up global cooperation against the key issue of cross border tax avoidance and evasion at the G20 summit starting on Saturday.

Modi, who is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, arrived in Brisbane on a five-day trip to Australia on the second leg of his 10-day three-nation tour.
He will also undertake a bilateral visit to the Australian capital Canberra for talks with Premier Tony Abbott on Tuesday.
The Prime Minister will also utilise the two-day 9th G20 summit of the world's biggest developed and emerging economies, to flag India's concerns over "jobless growth" prospects.
Ahead of the summit, Modi felt that focusing on transforming the quality of life of people and not just on issues like the health of the financial markets was necessary for creating employment-generating economic growth.
It was a bright and sunny day at Brisbane as Modi stepped out of his Special Air India plane at the international airport after an overnight flight from Myanmar capital Nay Phi Taw where he attended two back-to-back international summits and had a string of bilateral meetings.
"Reached Brisbane. It is bright and sunny outside," Modi tweeted.
Modi was received at the airport by the Queensland Premier Campbell Newman among others. Indian High Commissioner in Australia Biren Nanda was also present.
"A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money," Modi had said, as he is set to renew the country's commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
Modi had also said he intends to discuss how G20 can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The G20 includes 19 individual countries -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the US -- and the European Union (EU).
Collectively, the G20 economies account for around 85% of the GDP, 80% of world trade and two-thirds of the world population. The G20 was launched in 2008 in the US.
Jobs and growth will remain the focus of the G20 summit, despite strenuous lobbying to shift the spotlight to climate change and Ebola.
Australia, which holds the G20 presidency, on Friday re-emphasised the summit's mission when Treasurer Joe Hockey stressed the heavy burden on group members "to get real outcomes".
"We have a plan before the leaders of the world to grow the world economy, to create the jobs that are necessary, to lift people out of poverty, and we are determined to deliver that," he said.
On the table is Australia's call for the G20 to collectively add at least two per cent to world growth to 2018. If successful, this could generate millions of jobs, massive infrastructure activity and cut red tape.
G20 countries have also produced 1,000 plans to support the growth target.
Modi, referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney besides Canberra, had earlier said, "While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential."
"A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India's economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood," he said.
Indian officials said that the prime minister's trip will be a "landmark visit" and is aimed at "re-engaging" Australia.
Prime Minister Abbott had a telephonic talk with Modi before his departure from India to discuss the agenda for the multilateral meeting and he asked the Indian leader to share, in particular, his vision for accelerating global economic growth and employment generation.
Abbott conveyed that he and the Australian people were keenly awaiting the visit of Modi, who appreciated his personal attention to his visit and emphasised the importance he attached to his Australia visit as a step towards qualitatively transforming a relationship that he greatly values.
Abbott also sought Modi's support for Australia's infrastructure initiatives in the G20.
On his part, Modi thanked Abbott for his leadership in developing a meaningful agenda for the G20 Summit and expressed confidence that it would be one of the most memorable G20 Summits, which will impart new momentum to the global economy.
Modi also suggested that, in addition to facilitating financial flows for infrastructure financing, there was a need to look at innovative mechanisms for infrastructure development, including research on transforming waste into infrastructure inputs.
During the telephonic conversation, Modi also talked about creating a virtual centre for information exchange, guidance, identifying opportunities and facilitating flows, which would be beneficial to the poor countries as well.
Modi and Abbott had summit talks in Delhi last month during which India and Australia sealed a civil nuclear deal.
On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Modi is due to hold a series of bilateral meetings including with Germany's Angela Merkel, UK's David Cameron and France's Francois Hollande.
Modi will also have an informal interaction with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting of leaders of five-nation BRICS.
Modi has already met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday in Nay Phi Taw. Modi is also due to address a joint sitting of Federal Parliament in Canberra and the Indian community at a reception at the Olympic park in Sydney.
Modi will travel to Fiji on a day-long visit on November 19 before returning home the next day. He will be the first Indian Premier to visit the south Pacific Island nation after a gap of 33 years, the first being Indira Gandhi in 1981.

Saradha scam: Jail official  doctor  nurse on duty suspended after Kunal Ghosh suicide bid  saysMamataPrint
Written by Madhuparna Das | Kolkata | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:10 pm
Hours after former Trinamool MP Kunal Ghosh, who is a prime accused in the Saradha chit fund scam,  attempted suicide in jail, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that the superintendent of Presidency jail, attending doctor and the nurse on duty of the hospital have been suspended.
Ghosh tried to commit suicide by consuming sleeping pills. He was immediately rushed to the SSKM hospital after he was spotted gasping in the cell by a guard.
Significantly, three days ago, while Ghosh was produced before the court in connection with Saradha case, he screamed at the court premises and said that he would commit suicide if the investigating agencies do not arrest the ‘ main culprits’. “The actual culprits are moving free and I am rotting in the prison. If the CBI does not arrest the actual culprits in three days, I would commit suicide,” he said in the court premises.
The jail sources confirmed that Ghosh used to be depressed for last few days. He was also worried about his mother who is in critical condition now. Ghosh has been there in the high security cell in the Presidency correctional home. He has time and again said that the kingpins are still moving free.

HC stays Maharashtra job quotas for Marathas  MuslimsHC stays reservation for Marathas in jobs, education
Kanchan Chaudhari , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 14, 2014

The Bombay high court on Friday stayed the implementation of the state government’s decision to provide 16% quota in government jobs and educational institutes for the Maratha community.
The division bench of chief justice Mohit Shah and justice MS Sonak also stayed the 5% reservation for 50 Muslim communities in public employment, but allowed them to avail of the quota in educational institutes run and aided by the government.
The state government, however, has decided to challenge this decision in the Supreme Court, with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis saying he will take all possible steps to remove the stay on the Maratha reservation. While he did not comment on reservation for Muslims, the BJP has been opposed to it.
While hearing a bunch of public interest litigations, challenging the June 25 decision of the previous Congress-NCP cabinet, the bench concluded it was not up to the state to treat the Maratha community as a ‘backward class’.
“Rather, the National Commission for Backward Classes and the Mandal Commission has concluded the Marathas are a socially-advanced and prestigious community,” the court said, citing the findings of the Mandal Commission (1990), the National Commission for Backward Classes in February 2000 and a July 2008 report of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (Bapat Commission).
The bench noted several flaws in the report of the Narayan Rane Committee that had recommended the inclusion of the Maratha community in the socially- and economically-backward class, and which forms the basis of the 16 % reservation in favour of the community. The bench observed that the Rane committee did not refer to important rulings of the Supreme Court and findings of other commissions.
Further, constitutional benches of the Apex Court have laid down a law that the percentage of reservation for public employment cannot exceed 50%, the bench said, adding that the state did not have the power to breach that ceiling limit.
However, while refusing to stay the 5% reservation in education for backward Muslims, the bench said the material the state had relied on, to determine the backwardness of these 50 communities, makes a case for the existence of an extraordinary situation. “The material suggests the dire necessity to draw youth belonging to these communities to secular education,” the bench observed. “The material refers to an abysmally-low level of educational achievement, which ails the community, and a high dropout rate.”
Fadnavis has called for a meeting of group leaders of all political parties on Saturday morning. “The state is fully supportive of the Maratha reservation. We will appeal in SC. We will take measures to ensure that the quota remains. We will amend the existing law,” the CM told mediapersons.
Congress leader and former-CM Prithviraj Chavan, under whose leadership the quota was passed early this year, said his party would cooperate with the government to represent its case in the Apex Court. “The Congress will study the interim ruling and discuss it with legal experts. We will also check if the Congress can be a party to the petition,” he said.
 
‘NOT A BACKWARD COMMUNITY’
Commenting on the status of Marathas, the court observed, “Early historical and social documentation suggests that although Marathas originated from the Kunbi (farmers) caste, from the 14th century onwards, they evolved into a separate community with high social, educational and political status.”

WPI inflation drops to 5-year low of 1.77% in OctoberIndia's wholesale price inflation dropped to a five year low of 1.77% in October over continuing decline in food prices, including vegetables.
The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was at 2.38% in September and 7.24% in October 2013.
As per data released by the government on Friday, the food inflation fell to a nearly two-and-half year low of 2.7%.
Food inflation is on decline since May. The sharp drop in WPI inflation, which fell for the fifth month in a row, came at the back of retail inflation declining to a record low of 5.52% in October.
The rate of price rise in onion contracted 59.77% as compared to a contraction of 58.12% in September.
In case of vegetables, the contraction was 19.61%, while in protein rich items of egg, meat and fish it was 2.58% in October.
During the month, inflation in potato stood at 82.11%, against 90.23% in the previous month.
Inflation in manufactured products, like sugar, edible oils, beverages and cement, fell to 2.43% in October as against 2.84% in the previous month.
The August WPI inflation was revised higher to 3.85% from 3.74% earlier, the data said. Inflation in the fuel and power segment which include LPG, petrol and diesel declined to 0.43 % as compared to price rise of 1.33% in September.
The Reserve Bank which maintained status quo in interest rate since January, will come out with the monetary policy review on December 2. The RBI factors in retail inflation while formulating its monetary policy.
Slowing inflation builds case for RBI rate cut 
The decline in both retail and WPI inflation for October, coupled with improvement in industrial output for September, will put pressure on the RBI to lower interest rates to boost growth.
An uptick in manufacturing and capital goods pushed industrial output to a three-month high of 2.5% in September. Industry has been demanding easing of interest rates to boost growth, which has slumped to 4.7% in 2013-14.
The economy is estimated to grow in the range of 5.4-5.9% this fiscal.
Friday's data comes days after consumer price inflation had dropped to 5.52 percent in October, below the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 6 percent target for January 2016.
"With inflation at or under 6 percent we think RBI is likely to face pressure to ease, not just from the government, but also from RBI's own policy committee," said Devika Mehndiratta, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in Singapore.
She expects retail inflation to hit a low of close to 4 percent in November, opening up an opportunity for a 25 basis points interest rate cut in the second quarter of 2015.
Indian businesses have been pleading for a cut in interest rates, which are among the highest in Asia, to stimulate consumption in a domestic demand-driven economy.
Consumer goods output - a proxy for consumer demand that drives 60 percent of India's economy - has grown in just two of the last 21 months. It fell an annual 4.0 percent in September.
The RBI is meeting on Dec. 2 to review policy, having kept its key repo rate steady at 8.0 percent since January.
A Reuters poll last month had shown that economists expected rates to be held unchanged until well into next year, due to worries that price pressures would revive once a favourable base effect fades out and food prices rise after a poor summer rains.
Bond traders are betting on one of the biggest interest rate reductions among major emerging markets once the rate cutting cycle begins.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield had dropped 36 basis points since Oct. 1 until the last session on hopes of a rate cut.

SBI Q2 Profit Lags Estimates on Rise in Bad Loan Provision

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
State Bank of India, India's largest lender, warned on Friday there would be no quick fix for the country's banks, as improvements in loan quality will be gradual while a pick-up in credit demand could be a year away.
SBI, which accounts for about a quarter of loans and deposits in India, on Friday reported a 52 percent increase in provisions for bad loans in its second quarter -- a Rs 4030 crore hit that dampened profit growth.
SBI and peers such as ICICI Bank Ltd have suffered a surge in bad loans as economic expansion in the country slowed to below 5 percent in the past two fiscal years - the worst spell of sluggish growth in quarter of a century.
Signs of a revival in economic indicators have made banks optimistic, though a high level of bad loans is widely expected to persist for the next few quarters while credit growth hovers near its slowest rate in a decade.
"When we will see asset quality is improving, I don't believe that we will really see anything very sharp because this downturn has been very deep," SBI Chairwoman Arundhati Bhattacharya told a news conference.
"Once we see the demand cycle coming back, definitely we can begin to see things happening at a faster pace," she said, adding that was still about a year away.
SBI posted a net profit of Rs 3100 crore, an increase of 30.5 percent from the same period a year earlier but short of the Rs 3254 crore average analyst estimate in a Reuters poll.
More than two dozen state banks account for over 70 percent of advances in India - and also the bulk of the bad loans. Analysts estimate Indian lenders will need to raise as much as $110 billion over the next four years, to comply with global rules demanding stronger bank reserves as a buffer in times of crisis.
SBI's net non-performing loans as a percentage of net loans rose to 2.73 percent in the September quarter from 2.66 percent in the previous three months.
The pace of increase in bad loans slowed in the quarter, however, helping to send the stock to a five-month high.
Ms Bhattacharya, who took the helm just over a year ago, has vowed to tackle the increase in troubled loans by boosting vigilance and upgrading systems and software.

Facebooks new privacy policy  in five easypointsA man outside an office on the Facebook campus in Menlo Park, California. (Source: AP)
By: AP | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:53 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 2:27 pm
Facebook is once again trying to simplify its privacy policy, largely to address criticisms that it’s too complex and lengthy for the average user.  Laid out with illustrations into short subsections, the new policy explains what types of information Facebook collects and how it uses the data. The new policy is 70 percent shorter than the old one.
Many of the changes are cosmetic, designed to make the policy easier to digest. Still, it helps to go through it to get an idea of all the things Facebook knows about you.
Users have until Nov. 20 to comment on the proposed changes or ask questions. A finalized version will take effect soon after that.
Here are five things to remember about Facebook’s data policies.
—> LOCATION, LOCATION
Facebook only recently began allowing businesses to advertise to users based on their specific location. Previously, ads were targeted based on the “current city” listed on the profile. Both the old policy and the new one note that the company can access your location information based on your smartphone’s GPS information. The new policy points out that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals can also reveal device locations. Besides that, Facebook can also collect information from the photos you share on the site, including where they were taken.
—> BEYOND FACEBOOK
Facebook doesn’t just track what you do on its site. It also collects information about your activities when you’re off Facebook. For example, if you use Facebook to log in to outside websites and mobile apps, the company will receive data about those. It also gets information about your activity on other businesses it owns, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, in accordance with those services’ privacy policies.
—> AD TARGETING
Unless you decline targeting, or opt out, companies whose websites you visit off Facebook can also show you ads on Facebook. For example, a website can use browser cookies to record who visited it. It can then ask Facebook to show ads to these visitors — both on and off Facebook. If you want to opt out in the U.S., you can visit this website: http://aboutads.info/choices
—> ALL EYES ON YOU
Everything is fair game. Facebook explains it best: “We collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others.” Plus, Facebook says it also collects information about how you use Facebook, “such as the types of content you view or engage with or the frequency and duration of your activities.”
—> SHOPPING SPREE?
Facebook is testing a tool to let people buy things directly through its site. If you decide to do this, Facebook will collect information about your transaction, including your credit card number and billing and shipping address.

Broom in hand  Pawar responds to Modi s cleanliness driveBroom in hand, Pawar joins Modi's cleanliness drive

Extending his support to BJP beyond Maharashtra legislature, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday took a broom in his hands in a gesture signalling a new found bonhomie between the two parties.
Pawar, accompanied by his family members who included his daughter and MP Supriya Sule, former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar as well as party general secretary DP Tripathi, swept a road in his hometown Baramati in full glare of cameras which seemed to drive home the message of 'Swachh Bharat' of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government.
However, in an effort to stamp NCP's distinct identity in the drive, Pawar had, in a press conference held here a few days back, announced that his party activists would undertake the cleanliness drive in view of the rampant dengue cases in Maharashtra.
"We have started the cleanliness campaign today and photos are taken. But we have to ensure that streets are not littered with garbage tomorrow," he said after launching the campaign in Baramati.

NBCC Falls 5% as Q2 Results Disappoint

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Shares in National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) fell over 5 per cent to a day low of Rs 774 on Friday after the state-run developer's second quarter earnings failed to impress the Street. NBCC had reported September quarter results after markets closed yesterday.
Including today's fall, NBCC shares have corrected over 12 per cent since it touched a 52-week high of Rs 908.35 on November 5. The correction comes after a monstrous rally that led to over 440 per cent gains in NBCC shares year-to-date.
NBCC's Q2 standalone net profit was flat year-on-year (y-o-y) at Rs 60 crore, while its revenue grew only 5 per cent y-o-y to Rs 904 crore.
NBCC also reported a drop in its operating margin (EBIT margin) in Q2 to 5.53 per cent against 7.86 per cent y-o-y on accounts of higher expenses relating to work & consultancy. Its work & consultancy expenses increased 22 per cent y-o-y to Rs 775 crore whereas its revenue grew by only 5 per cent in Q2 of FY15.
As of 2.04 p.m. shares in NBCC traded 3.67 per cent lower at Rs 790 apiece, underperforming the broader Nifty which was up 0.2 per cent.
Why have shares rallied?
NBCC is India's largest PSU in the construction sector. Its "public works organisation" status helps it bag orders without much competition and even on a nomination basis, Nomura said in a report dating September. According to the brokerage, NBCC has a strong presence in the project management contract (PMC) business with a strong customer base in mostly government organisations.
NBCC shares were in demand as it was fast emerging as a strong play on large redevelopment opportunities from government bodies and other PSUs. Brokers expect NBCC to gain from Modi government's promise of building 100 smart cities in India.
Financially, NBCC is an asset light company (its investment in fixed assets is as low as Rs 24 crore as on September 30 against its total asset of Rs 4,453 crore). It also enjoys negative working capital and a cash-rich balance sheet).
NBCC's valuations were attractive despite sharp run up leading to strong buying interest.

Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the nation's biggest oil company, on Thursday reported a net loss of Rs 898 crore in the September quarter as drop in international oil rates led to massive inventory loss.
The company suffered a net loss of Rs 898.46 crore, or (-) Rs 3.70 per share, in July-September against a net profit Rs 1,683.92 crore, or Rs 6.94 per share, IOC Chairman B Ashok said.
"The loss was mainly due to inventory of Rs 4,272 crore in Q2 as compared to an inventory gain of Rs 4,635 crore," he said.
This was because global oil prices slumped from  $ 111 per barrel to $95.
IOC lost $ 1.95 on converting every barrel of crude oil into fuel as compared to a positive margin of $ 7.43 per barrel, he said.
A K Sharma, Director (Finance), IOC said the company lost Rs 12,215 crore in revenue in Q2, almost all of which was made good by way of cash subsidy from government (Rs 3,085 crore) and dole out from upstream firms like ONGC (Rs 9,098 crore).
"There was an unmet under-recovery (revenue loss) of Rs 32 crore in Q2. Besides there is an unmet under-recovery Rs 1,145 crore in H1," he said.
Ashok said revenue rose 1.3 per cent to Rs 111,664 crore in Q2. Refineries processed 13.407 million tons of crude as compared to 13.344 million refinery throughput in Q2 of last fiscal.
Sales were up 4.5 per cent to 17.126 million tons while pipeline throughput rose 5.9 per cent to 19.039 million tons.

Higher provisioning hits Hindalco’s Q2 profit
Our Bureau
business (general)
Hindalco, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla group, reported a drop of 78 per cent in its net profit for the second quarter of 2014-15 at Rs.79 crore owing to one-time provisions for additional levy relating to the allocation of coal mines.
In September 2014, the Supreme Court had declared all allocations of the coal blocks made since 1993 as illegal and had quashed the allocation of 204 coal blocks. A statement from Hindalco said these coal blocks include Talabira-I block held and operated by the company and three other coal blocks namely Mahan, Tubed and Talabira II & III allocated to the company jointly with others. These were being developed by respective joint venture companies established for that purpose.
According to a company statement, the exceptional items include liability provision of Rs.563 crore towards additional levy of Rs.295 per tonne of coal extracted by Hindalco from the commencement of the production of coal from Talabira I mine in 2013-14 up to September 2014 in compliance with the Supreme Court order and a provision of Rs.258 crore towards diminution in carrying value of investment in Aditya Birla Minerals, Australia, a subsidiary of the company, on significant decline in value of the company’s investment therein as reflected in decline in its quoted share price over a considerable period of time.
However, the company’s net sales rose 36 per cent to Rs.8,554 crore, which the company attributed to higher volume and realisations. The operating profit too was up 37 per cent at Rs.1,120 crore, ‘despite a sharp surge in the cost of coal’, the company statement said.

G20 Day Zero: PM Narendra Modi to meet Cameron  dine with AbeFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make the most of a public holiday declared by Brisbane on Friday and meet at least two global leaders — David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, during the day at the summit venue and Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, over dinner, a day ahead of the Group of 20 (G20) summit on November 15-16. He will simultaneously kick off the India-Australia bilateral with a visit to the Queensland University of Technology in the forenoon.

The Prime Minister’s visit to Australia for the two-day G20 Summit will mark his debut presence at a big ticket multilateral fora and will be followed by bilateral talks with Premier Tony Abbott in Canberra.
His Australia visit has a strong business and commerce agenda, but the Prime Minister will showcase several other facets of relationship including education and skills, culture and tourism, and defence.
“An Indian Prime Minister is visiting Australia after 28 years. The agenda is balanced, and comprehensive,” an Australian government official said, not willing to be quoted.
“In Brisbane, he will meet business persons, including those from the resources sector, and in Melbourne leading Australian CEOs,” another local government official, liasioning with the Indian delegation said. Modi is keen to get a larger pie of institutional investment from Australia.
“Australia is the third largest institutional invest or with resources of $3 trillion-plus,” the official added.
 
At the G20 meeting, Modi is expected to make a strong pitch for growth accompanied with creation of jobs, infrastructure funding for developing countries, resolution of taxation in the specific context of BEPS (base erosion and profit sharing), larger voice in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and India’s own commitment to contribute significantly to the additional 2 per cent growth that global leaders are seeking.
Modi’s statements in such a multilateral fora will also assume significance since the purview of G20, whose members account for almost 85 per cent of global output, has gradually expanded over the last six years. From just fighting the global economic crisis of 2008, it has over the last six years progressed to include world trade, climate change and energy.
Ahead of the summit, India and the US also achieved a breakthrough in the WTO talks, with New Delhi finally agreeing to be party to the Trade Facilitation Agreement.
An Indian Prime Minister will visit this continent after almost three decades, and Modi hopes to unravel various dimension of India’s relationship with the Down Under. Similar to his visit to the United States, Modi will reach out to the 4,50,000-strong Indian diaspora in Australia. At the policy level, he will demand for a sharp cut in the costs of remittances for NRIs who send money back to India.
The Indian diaspora has gone the extra mile to recreate New York’s Madison Square event in Australia too. He will address people of Indian origin in Sydney’s Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Australian political personalities are expected. In Brisbane, besides unveiling a Gandhi statue on Sunday, he is scheduled to address a gathering of some 1,200 people in the City Hall. “More than 5,000 people have expressed interest to attend it,” says Prasad KDV Yarlagadda, President, Federation of Indian Communities in Queensland.

Police mute voice of J&K separatistsPrint
Written by Bashaarat Masood | Srinagar | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:02 am
The Jammu and Kashmir police have either detained or restricted the movements of most separatist leaders, who invariably issue a boycott call during polls. The separatists say that by denying them a level playing field, the government has conceded defeat.
Syed Ali Shah Geelani, chairman of the Hurriyat’s hardline faction, is under house detention, while leaders of his group are behind bars to to prevent them for campaigning for a boycott. Police have been deployed outside the house of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the moderate faction. And activists Yasin Malik, Shabir Shah and Nayeem Khan have all been detained.
“The message is loud and clear: nobody will be allowed to create any kind of disturbance (during the elections),” Kashmir’s IGP Abdul Gani Mir said.
Geelani has called for boycott of a number of polls. This time, moderate separatists too have called for a boycott. In the past, they would term the elections a non-issue. This, police sources say, is one of the reasons for the crackdown. In the parliamentary polls, many people had skipped voting.
The separatists call the police action their “first victory”. “The government is denying a level playing field to us,” says Mirwaiz. “By arresting Hurriyat leaders and cadres, the government has already conceded defeat”.
Mirwaiz adds, “One has to understand that for India, elections are a democratic process. But that democracy and those democratic rights are altogether missing in Kashmir,” he said. “To call for a boycott or to campaign for it peacefully are a democratic right but the Indian state has no respect for opposition.”
Geelani echoed: “This has exposed India and these so-called elections. It is not a democracy, it is a farce. First they choke opposition voices and then conduct elections. It shows that India is not a democracy”.

India Post making plans to enter e-commerceBengal Chambers of Commerce
(A senior official of India…)
KOLKATA: To leverage the country's fast growing e-commerce space, the West Bengal circle of the postal department has approached various industrial bodies with a plan to create an online marketplace for the local traders.
A senior official of India Post at Kolkata GPO said that since e-commerce is a sunrise industry, it is trying to earn higher revenue in the region by involving local traders and business houses.
"For that we are planning to take the help of chambers of commerce present in Kolkata as well as Howrah and other districts," the official said.
India Post has already written to the Bengal Chambers of Commerce requesting it to arrange for an interaction between the Postal officials and local traders, official sources said.
"We have send a proposal to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry basically to arrange an interactive session with traders and financial houses here. We will also seek help from other chambers in the city and those in Howrah and other districts," a source said.
The source said that though the aim was to rope in local traders irrespective of their business volumes, big business houses are also welcome.
"We want everybody to join us in our venture in the e-commerce market. At the moment most of the e-commerce companies neglect the moffusil areas, villages and distant parts of the country. India Post's wide reach to any corner can bring dramatic changes to the whole e-commerce industry," he pointed out.
India Post is creating a special cell to cater to this need, the source said.
"Immediately we are not looking for any profit. But we know that revenues will grow with time. We have plans for free pick-ups. Because consumers don't want to make an upfront payment, there will be added capabilities like Cash On Delivery and reverse logistics. We are working on a software to start the COD service," one of the sources said.
On developing infrastructure for the project a senior officials at Kolkata GPO said, "India Post aims to be the centre of the country's ongoing e-commerce revolution with an investment plan of around Rs 100 crore in the next couple of years to set up warehouses for the packaging purpose."
The department currently enjoys an 89 per cent penetration in rural areas across the country.
"At the moment we are not thinking of competition, but we are focusing on rural areas where we have the best reach compared to any other entity," an official said.
He pointed out that though India Post is likely to face competition in metro cities, in small towns, suburban and rural areas it would be better placed because of the department's maximum presence.
"A small trader in Nadia with a customer in Andamans need not to worry about delivering orders. Now, he can take orders without any hesitation because India Post will deliver the product, be it the Andamans or the Himalayas. We will be aggressively doing this business," he added.
Welcoming the move, Bengal Chamber of Commerce President Alok Roy said: "I think its a very good idea and a brilliant move by India Post. It should be good for the local traders and they must take advantage of this. And this will definitely bring in new life for India Post."
"Chambers act as an interface between traders and organisations and we will be happy to help them interact with India Post. We would ensure that the message reaches the traders and the initiative works out successfully," Roy said.
India Post, has already entered into a partnership with Amazon India and launched a pilot project.

India successfully test-fires n-capable Prit...Balasore
(The indigenously-developed…)
BALASORE: India today successfully test-fired its indigenously developed nuclear-capable Prithvi-II surface-to-surface missile, which has a strike range of 350 km, from a test range at Chandipur near here as part of a user trial by Army.
Defence sources said the state-of-the-art missile, which is capable of carrying 500 kg to 1000 kg of warheads, was test-fired from a mobile launcher in salvo mode from launch complex-3 of Integrated Test Range at about 10.40 hrs.
It is thrusted by liquid propulsion twin engines and uses advanced inertial guidance system with manoeuvring trajectory.
Describing the trial as "fully successful," ITR Director M V K V Prasad told PTI that the test was conducted by Strategic Force Command.
The sophisticated missile was randomly chosen from the production stock and the entire launch activities were carried out by SFC and monitored by scientists of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as part of training exercise, defence sources said.
"The missile trajectory was tracked by DRDO radars, electro-optical tracking systems and telemetry stations located along the coast of Odisha.
"The downrange teams onboard the ship deployed near the designated impact point in the Bay of Bengal monitored the terminal events and splashdown," the sources said.
Prithvi II, which was inducted into the SFC in 2003, is the first missile to be developed by DRDO under India's prestigious Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP) and is now a proven technology.
Today's launch was part of a regular training exercise of SFC and was monitored by DRDO scientists, the sources said.
Such training launches clearly indicate India's operational readiness to meet any eventuality and also establishes the reliability of this deterrent component of India's Strategic arsenal, the sources said.
The last user trials of Prithvi-II in 2014 were successfully carried out from the same base on January 7, 2014 and March 28, 2014, they added.

Markets ahead of macro fundamentals Time will tell if it s true for India  says Anshu JainAnshu Jain
(Sentiment plays a very important…)
In an interview with ET Now, Anshu Jain, co-CEO, Deutsche AG , shares his macroeconomic outlook and talks about the opportunities and challenges that urbanisation in India does throw up. Excerpts:
ET Now: Sentiment seems to be looking up, everybody wants to talk about India. Is India back on the radar? Is this optimism really justified?
Anshu Jain: Sentiment plays a very important role in economies. The mood and optimism on India have definitely picked up.
ET Now: How do we see India's optimism being played out from an outside perspective?
Anshu Jain: The view on India from outside the country, particularly from investors into India, has definitely turned around and in the last six months represents a new level of optimism towards the economy.
ET Now: Growth is slowly beginning to pick up, inflation has cooled off. Will India become an emerging market darling once again? We were on the radar, we slipped. Are we back on the radar as far as emerging markets are concerned?
Anshu Jain: Certainly, the short-term performance of the equity markets suggests so.
ET Now: Are equity markets running ahead of macroeconomic fundamentals?
Anshu Jain: They can sometimes. Time will tell whether that is true for India or not.
ET Now: I particularly want to talk to you about this reform thrust of the government. You come from one of the biggest bankers in the world. The question that one would want to ask you at this stage is, given the majority that this government had, are banking sector reforms something that should be high on their radar?
Anshu Jain: They are high on their radar. We had the fortune of the Finance Minister presenting to us at a conclave and he made it fairly clear that if India is going to fund its growth, then getting the banks back on track and making sure that their balance sheets are capable of expansion is one of his priorities.
ET Now: You are particularly here to discuss urbanisation in India and the challenges that it throws up. This government is very serious about it, it is talking about smart cities, it is talking about bullet trains. Something that has not really been said in the public space so much and because you are particularly speaking about this topic, if I may ask you, what are the opportunities and challenges that urbanisation in India does throw up?
Anshu Jain: Urbanisation would be the greatest opportunity and also one of the big challenges that India is going to face. It is an opportunity because in order to create wealth, it has been fairly demonstrable that as people moved from rural areas into cities, there is a wealth effect which takes place.
In India and China alone, 500 million people, that is twice the population of the United States, will move from rural areas into cities. The government is right to be very focused on urbanization, but equally large cities like the one we are standing in right now also have some tremendous challenges. So pulling together best practice is something which should be smart and the government is right to put it right at the top.
ET Now: What are of the best practices that India can learn from some of the most developed cities in the world?
Anshu Jain: Urban age is our attempt and we are trying to get not just lessons from the developed cities, but indeed a lot of the developing cities. We were in Rio, we were in Mexico City and the fact is that when you take these very large urban clusters, particularly in the developing world, there is a lot they can share with each other.

Startups spending big bucks on creative agencies to improve brand value

Creya Learning
(The results, entrepreneurs…)
BENGALURU: In a fast evolving ecosystem where startups battle against odds to grab the attention of all and sundry, branding has become a critical component of the business plan. Startups these days are strategising from the start to create a strong identity for their products or services, to reap longterm business rewards.
Creya Learning , Soothe Healthcare , and Giftingnation.com are some examples of companies that have designed a branding exercise since its inception and have not hesitated to spend bucks on creative agencies.
The results, entrepreneurs said, are manifold ranging from increasing customer base, attracting investor attention and better recall value in respective fraternities.
Education startup Creya brought on board Idiom Design and Consulting as branding partners early into their journey. "All of us three founders had divergent ideas. Idiom helped us crystallise our ideas and thoughts on what our brand stands for. They gave us alternatives to pick up from," said Datla V Reddy, coach and co-founder of Creya.
"We've got a high recall value in the fraternity and we come across as different to others. Opening doors has become that much easier with customers," Reddy added in the context of benefits to branding.
Similarly, for Bengaluru-based Giftingnation.com, a discovery portal for gifts, branding was important to break-free from clutter in the sector. "It's crowded with pricing and aggressive marketing strategies," said Srinivas Mothey, managing director, Giftingnation, which started its branding activities six months into launch mid last year. "We wanted to make gifting relevant 365 days of the year and move it from occasion-led to moments," Mothey said, who hired Propaganda India, an advertising agency in the city for the same.
The portal now gets 2,000 unique visitors daily, up from 500-600 and has 34,000 Facebook likes. "Our stickiness has increased. Repeat users have gone up too without mailers. We've also been able to build personalised relationships with customers," Mothey said.
More importantly, branding has increased its vendor base and has sought the attention of biggies like Park Avenue, Cadbury's, and Manchester United who have approached them to stock merchandise on the site. About 20 of its 100 vendors are big brands, Mothey said. "The process of branding isn't just about looking good but should mirror the character of a business. The image should depict where you want to be, or what you've achieved or where you are," said Reshma Thomas, partner, Purplemango, a creative agency in Bengaluru specialising in branding and design and has worked with startups too.
The big picture here is perception of a brand in the eyes of investors, as seen in the case of Noida-based Soothe Healthcare, makers of lowcost sanitary napkins Paree, and online youth apparel company CampusSutra.com.
Dhiraj Agarwal, founder and CEO of CampusSutra.com that's in talks with investors to raise $2 million in funding, said the prototype of a new and improved website has resonated well with investors. The company hired Propaganda India, a five-year-old advertising firm in Bengaluru for branding initiatives that included website revamp."There's a much better understanding of what our business is now," Agarwal said.
For Sahil Dharia, managing director of Soothe, building brand Paree was important to connect to his target audience, which is women aged between 14-30 years in the Rs 1.5 to 5 lakh household income bracket."The primary thing is to address a huge market. Branding would be the right way to connect to make Paree a lifestyle choice," Dharia said, whose branding activities were based on TG insights that came out of extensive market research.
The efforts paid off well as the company's been approached by strategic investors interested in taking the brand forward and has been commanding valuations 10x of current revenues. Soothe will close FY14-15 at around Rs 3.5 crore, Dharia said. "We have been approached by market players who are telling us to expand Paree into a personal care range," he shared, adding that they will be introducing deodorants to Paree's portfolio.
Priya Jayaraman, co-founder and business director of Propaganda, who has worked with a myriad set of startups, including CampusSutra and Giftingnation, said most companies come on board as clients at pre-investment stage or when just funded to ensure that the entrepreneur's vision is depicted correctly. "That's the juncture when the brand can scale up. It takes a while to reach customers, however, having a brand and vision helps everyone in the startup come on the same page, hire, and build philosophies internally that resonate with their vision," she said.
Other startup clients include social enterprise Drishti Eye Hospital, and six-month old mobile payments startup, Momoe. "Before you think about branding, you need to make sure your brand is defined.Give time to formalise the entity itself," Thomas advised.

Chhattisgarh: New death blamed on antibiotics used in sterilisation campCongress misleading country since Independence: Bharatiya Janata Party
One person has died and six more were hospitalized after consuming antibiotic tablets apparently from the same batch blamed for more than a dozen deaths following a sterilisation camp in eastern India, two hospital officials said on Friday.
The patients were being treated at the Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences where one of them died, the officials from the hospital said. They declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to media.
“They came with the medicine strips in their hand … They complained of vomiting, dizziness and swelling in the feet,” said an official at the hospital in the Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh said.
The state authorities have arrested the father and son owners of Mahawar Pharma, a small drug maker in the state capital Chhattisgarh and sealed their factory after identifying their ciprofloxacin antibiotic tablets as one of several medicines prescribed at the camps. The Mahawars were not available for comment.
The Times of India newspaper said they denied wrongdoing, saying that if their widely distributed drugs were to blame, more people would have died.
The latest death means 14 people have died after consuming the drugs. Most of the victims were administered the medicine at government run sterilisation camps. More than 100 remain in hospital, several in a critical condition.
The new patients did not take part in the sterilisation camps and had consumed the drugs separately, the officials said.
The incident has drawn unflattering attention to India’s mass sterilisation programme as well as weak quality control standards for drugs procured by state governments.
India is the world’s top steriliser of women, and efforts to rein in population growth have been described as the most draconian after China. Indian birth rates fell in recent decades, but population growth is among the world’s fastest.
Sterilisation is popular because it is cheap and effective, and sidesteps cultural resistance and problems with distribution of other types of contraception in rural areas.

Saradha scam: BJP seeks CBI probe into Kunal Ghoshs suicide attemptPrint
Written by Liz Mathew | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:37 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 2:42 pm
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday sought a CBI inquiry into the suicide attempt by Kunal Ghosh , the suspended Trinamool Congress MP who was arrested in Saradha chit fund scam.
Ghosh has attempted suicide by consuming sleeping pills in his prison cell.
The BJP, which has been vocal on the issue, alleged that many had suspected political motive behind the arrest of Kunal Ghosh because he had started to expose senior TMC leaderships involvement in Shardha Chit fund scam. Pointing out that Ghosh, former CEO of Saradha Media Group, had threatened he would commit suicide if TMC leaders like Mukul Roy and Madan Mitra were not arrested, BJP national secretary and West Bengal in charge, Sidharth Nath Singh said: “CBI being independent will follow their own line of investigation, however what is alarming is that Bengal police and the jail authorities allowed Kunal Ghosh to commit suicide inside the jail after he had already made his intention clear.”
“Since Kunal Ghosh is a prime witness to Shardha scam it was imperative for Bengal police to be more alert and should have monitored 24×7 Kunal Ghosh. Therefore the approach of Jail authorities raises further questions, whether it was suicide attempt or political conspiracy to suppress the evidence? Also it is important to know how the drugs slipped into his room,” Singh asked in a statement.
“BJP demands that CBI should investigate also the suicide attempt of Kunal Ghosh and under the process of law ensure a safer custody of Shardha scam’s prime witness,” he added.

SBI Q2 Net rises 31% to Rs 3 100cr | EarningsSBI tightens up on the cost front, Q2 profit climbs 30% to Rs 3,100 crore

(Country's largest bank SBI today…)
MUMBAI: Even as loan growth remained muted this fiscal year, tighter control over expenses and higher earnings from services such as commissions and brokerages helped State Bank of India (SBI) post 30% growth in net profit for September quarter at Rs 3,100 crore. The stock rose 2.5% to close at Rs 2,788 as bad loans fell and earnings were in line with expectations.
Giving an outlook for coming quarters, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the bank expects profit to come from a healthy loan book, while adding that worries on bad debt will continue until the economy revives.
Total expenses at the country's largest bank rose just 2.2% to Rs 9,423 crore while net revenue — net interest income and non-interest income — rose 15% to Rs 17,844 crore. The non-interest income such as earnings from selling third-party products, guarantees, brokerages and fees, rose 40% to Rs 4,570 crore while net interest income was up 8.36% to Rs 13,276 crore.
Giving an outlook for the economy, Bhattacharya said, "The downturn has been very deep and we will see a gradual improvement. But once we see the demand cycle coming back, definitely we will see things happening at a faster pace. The pace will pick up, but for the pace to pick up, we are 12 months away."
On mergers of associate banks with SBI, she said, "We are close to coming with some kind of roadmap and the government is also very eager to find our view on this matter. So, we will come with it very shortly." In the past, two associate banks have been merged with the bank. It currently has five associate banks.
The State Bank of India group posted a 31% rise in net profit at Rs 4,024 crore. State Bank of India's loan book saw 9% growth at Rs 12,42,638 crore. However, on a yearto-date basis (April-September), the loan book shrank Rs 8,300 crore. "So, we are not really seeing a robust growth in loans and therefore, in the next two quarters, we are looking at 11-12% overall growth," Bhattacharya said.
These projections are substantially lower than 15.4% loan growth that the bank registered in the previous fiscal. Deposits rose 14% to Rs 14,73,785 crore, of which the share of lowcost ones - CASA - was 42.79%. Bhattacharya indicated that she was looking forward to a reduction in interest rates by the central bank. Corporate India has been clamouring for the Reserve Bank of India to lower rates at its December 2 monetary policy announcement.
"CPI (consumer price index) numbers clearly show no demand," she said. "When there is no demand, keeping high interest does not serve any purpose. We believe interest should start trending downwards... We believe, by the first quarter of the next year... we will be able the see the downward cycle beginning."
The ratio of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) — bad loans before making provisions — fell to 4.8% to Rs 60,712 crore against 5.6% a year ago. The drop is largely due to a big write-off amounting to Rs 4,787 crore against Rs 1,253 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The bank saw fresh non-performing assets of Rs 7,700 crore, recovery of Rs 965 crore and upgradation of Rs 1,670 crore. Restructured loans stood at Rs 4,351 crore and the bank expects another Rs 3,000 crore will be added in coming quarters.

Accent on male sterilisation NEW DELHI, November 14, 2014

Between 2009 and 2012, families of 568 women had to be paid compensation after they died during or post sterilisation surgeries
Between 2008 and March 2012, the Centre, under its Family Planning Insurance Scheme, had to pay compensation for botched sterilisation procedures which included 438 cases of complications, 18,887 failure cases and 675 death cases.
In 2012, the Ministry of Health informed the Lok Sabha that between 2009 and 2012, families of 568 women had to be paid compensation after they died during or post sterilisation surgeries.
Statistics show despite female sterilisation being invasive, more time consuming and involving more risks, the government has failed to encourage male sterilisation, which is less intrusive, needs little post-operative care and is safer.
Citing this data, activists and health care professionals are demanding that the Centre should now focus on male sterilisation and expand the bouquet of temporary contraception.
Poonam Muttreja, executive director of Population Foundation of India said there is a need to review the family planning programmes and also wean away from the practice of giving incentives for meeting targets.
“Family planning programmes in India have never been assessed and evaluated. There is lack of counselling and poor management of side effects for women who undergo permanent and temporary contraception. Also, we need to give incentives not for meeting targets by sterilising more numbers, but for meeting the quality requirements of the procedures,” she said.
In 2011, the government conducted sterilisation of 150,540 women as against 201,715 in 2012 -- a jump of 33.99 per cent; the number of men who were sterilised during this period grew by 3.03 per cent.
Despite redesigning its family planning programme to have more focus on spacing methods, the government has relied heavily on sterilisation carried out through camps.
A senior official in the Ministry of Health admitted that little work was done to research and establish newer, safer ways of permanent contraception. “Even for temporary contraception the government has not been able to offer modern forms like injectible contraception. From our field visits we have been able to gather that women cannot force men to use condoms, in some areas where religious or cultural diktats do not allow contraception or the men themselves are against it, women have confided that they cannot even rely on intrauterine devices or birth control pills. In such scenarios injectible contraception is ideal,” the official said.
With the District Level Household & Facility Survey (2007-08) indicating that 46 per cent of the people are not using any form of contraceptive, non government organisations want the government to redouble the efforts to meet the gap.
“At the London Summit on Family Planning (2012), the Government of India committed to additionally providing 48 million women and girls with access to contraceptives by 2020. However, around 1 in 5 women of reproductive age do not have access to contraception such as condoms and OC pills. India’s promises at the Family Planning 2012 Global Summit will reinforce the pressures of meeting ‘targets’, which has dangerous and long-term implications for the health of the people,” said Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Sama Resource Group for Women and Health, Common Health and National Alliance for Maternal Health and Human Rights in a statement.
Concerns are also being expressed over the failure to adhere to the 2005 Supreme Court order that enforced following guidelines for conducting sterilization procedures.

Pizza Hut is rebooting itself for a new generation of pizza eaters.
Following two years of disappointing sales as consumers sought even more exotic flavors and personalized options, the world's largest pizza chain on Monday will announce plans to turn upside down almost every facet of its identity.
Pizza Hut will focus on dozens of new flavor options as it mounts the 56-year-old brand's biggest-ever redo. It will add 11 new pizza recipes, 10 new crust flavors, six new sauces, five new toppings, four new flavor-pack drizzles, a new logo, new uniforms and, yes, even a new pizza box.
For those keeping count, the chain is more than doubling its available ingredients at all 6,300 U.S. locations beginning Nov. 19.
"This is the biggest change we've ever made," Carrie Walsh, chief marketing officer, says in a telephone interview. "We're redefining the category."
The ongoing tailspin -- eight consecutive quarters of same-store sales declines -- recently resulted in a management reshuffle.  David Gibbs, who has been U.S president, was named CEO last week. He was not available for this story.
Even the chain's sister brands at Yum Brands — Taco Bell and KFC — generally have been growing, but Pizza Hut seems to have hit a wall. Will these changes be enough to heal an ailing brand?  Or, perhaps, are they too many, too late?
"Pizza Hut may be doing too much too quickly," says Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic, the restaurant industry research specialist. "It would appear that the brand that has lost touch with the consumer is trying to change too much overnight."  He suggests a more gradual approach because, among other things, all of these changes could particularly confuse the chain's traditional customers.
Not so, says Walsh. Pizza Hut researched "hundreds" of ingredients, she says.  "These are the ones customers told us they want."
It's not the first time a major pizza chain tried to quickly reinvent itself.  Back in 2009, Domino's, which had taken plenty of public grief for the taste of its pizza, changed everything in the recipe of its core pizza.  New sauce. New crust. New cheese.  It turned out to be a hit.
In this case, however, Pizza Hut is not changing its core recipe. Instead, it's adding many, many more choices.
How many?  Who's counting.  But consider this:  There will now be about 1,000 ways to customize something as basic as a pepperoni pizza at Pizza Hut, says Walsh.
Among Pizza Hut's new offerings, it's going from:
• One crust choice to 10,  including salted pretzel and honey sriracha.
• One sauce choice to six, including garlic Parmesan and Buffalo.
• Zero "premium" toppings to five,  including sliced banana peppers and Peruvian cherry peppers.
• Zero "drizzles" to five, which are basically sauces like Buffalo and balsamic that are lightly drizzled on the top of the pizza after it's baked.
• Six special recipes to 22, including 7-Alarm Fire (loaded with peppers and jalapeno) to Giddy-Up Barbecue Chicken (with chicken and bacon and barbecue sauce.)
It also will nationally roll-out a so-called Skinny Slice pizza line -- with five offerings at about 250 calories per slice.
To announce the change, the chain will launch its largest-ever advertising campaign dubbed "The Flavor of Now," says Walsh, though she declines to provide details.  There's even a possibility that the chain, which hasn't advertised during a Super Bowl in 15 years, is considering such a move for the upcoming big game on Feb. 1.
"We're looking," says Walsh. "This change deserves a big statement."

India s GDP to grow at 6.3 pct in 2015: Morgan StanleyFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
India would have the fastest economic expansion among Asian countries and its gross domestic product is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent in 2015, according to Morgan Stanley forecasts of global economies.
The Indian rupee’s exchange rate to USD would be at Rs 62.2 by end of next year compared to Rs 62 in the current quarter (Q4 this year), according to a presentation made at the Morgan Stanley’s Annual Asia Pacific Summit held here from November 12-14 said.
It is seen at Rs 62.5 in the first two quarters of next year and Rs 62.3 in the third quarter of next year.
Comparative to other Asian GDP growths, India would have the fastest economic expansion, it said.
India’s gross domestic product is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent in 2015, up from 5.3 this year, it said.
“We are constructive on the INR from the outlook perspective,” Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley’s Chief Asia Economist, told PTI.
Strong capital inflow and the current account deficit under-two per cent would add upward pressure on the Rupee. Reforms are providing confidence in the Indian economy growth.
The Indian government’s policy action to improve business environment and lower oil prices are among the factors supporting the GDP growth, Ahya said.
Structural reforms related to land, labour and tax supporting the economic growth would support economic growths in the coming years. The risk would be any disruption to execution and delivery of reforms as well as a slowdown in exports, he pointed out.
On imports, the lower oil prices have been helpful and supporting the economic growth. Oil imports were down at 4 per cent of the GDP now from 6 per cent in 2012.
“It is obviously helping the recovery process,” Ahya said.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley has forecasted a sub-par global growth at 3.5 per cent in 2015, up nominally from 3.1 per cent this year. In Asia, China’s GDP is forecasted to contract to 7.1 per cent in 2015 from 7.3 per cent in 2014.
Asian GDP, excluding Japan’s, would grow to 6.3 per cent in 2015, up by a small proportion from 6 per cent this year. Japan’s GDP growth would be stagnant at 0.8 per cent in 2014 and 2015.
Some 1,700 delegates including representatives of 300 global corporations are attending the summit.

(The stock surged as much…)
MUMBAI: NCC, a Hyderabadbased engineering and construction firm, has been under the spotlight on Dalal Street of late as investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has been raising its stake in the company in recent quarters. Jhunjhunwala, known to have a following in the market, increased his stake in NCC recently through the open market and by subscribing to the rights issue.
The stock surged as much as 6.89 per cent in intra day trade on Friday and hit an all-day high of 61.25 and a low of 58.10 on the BSE.
He has acquired four crore shares by subscribing to the rights issue and bought 6.5 lakh shares through the open market on October 31. He held 11.85% stake as on September 30, 2014 and with this purchase, his stake has risen to 12.78%.
So, what makes Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC?
Analysts believe the investor could be betting on a turnaround in the company as the rights share issue and sale of assets could cut debt. "We see an improved growth prospects for NCC with better liquidity and lower debt burden post completion of its rights issue," said Ashish Shah, analyst, IDFC Securities .
"With a leaner balance sheet and negligible capital commitment towards its asset portfolio, we expect traction in NCC's core EPC business."
NCC has risen by 33% in the last one month and 178% so far this year against ET Construction index's gain of 13% and 47%, respectively, during the same period. Private equity firm Blackstone held 9.9%stake in NCC as on September 30.
"NCC has multiple triggers waiting in the wings , which can lead to significant cash accrual and expect robust growth in the order book over the next two years," said Vibhor Singhal, analyst at Phillip Capital.
NCC's Rs 600-crore rights issue has been subscribed by 1.14 times last month. The proceeds from this issue will be used for repayment of its term loans and NCDs, which stand at about Rs 600 crore currently on a standalone basis. The borrowing cost of these loans ranges from 10-15% with the weighted average borrowing cost of about 13%. With these loans now proposed to be repaid, it is expected to result in interest savings of at least Rs 60 crore for the company.
Post the proposed rights issue, NCC's debt-to-equity ratio on a standalone basis will reduce to 0.6 from 1. On a consolidated basis, it will fall to 1 from 1.4.

Tata Power fell as much as 3.6 per cent after the company reported its July-September earnings. The company posted a loss of Rs 777.6 million for the September quarter.
Traders said that the consensus expectation for FY15 may see substantial revision downwards. Mean estimate for FY15 earnings per share was at Rs 5.57, according to Reuters Data.
Weak performance was led by no accounting of compensatory tariff at Mundra plant and poor performance at coal mines. Stress continued on cashflows due to delay in compensatory tariff for Mundra plant, the company said on Thursday.
At 10: 58 a.m., the stock was trading at Rs 86.6, down 2.42 per cent or Rs 2.15.

White Widow   worlds most-wanted woman terrorist  shot deadprint
Samantha Lewthwaite, dubbed 'White Widow', wrote an ode to the late al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden proclaiming her love for him
Samantha Lewthwaite or the White Widow has reportedly been gunned down in war-torn Ukraine by a Russian marksman.
According to The Mirror, Lewthwaite, the world’s most wanted woman terrorist,  had joined the Ukraine conflict just two weeks ago and was fighting on the side of a pro-government group, Aidar, as a sniper.
The Russian sniper who killed the British terrorist now has a bounty of $630,000 on his head from Ukrainian special services.
Muslim-convert Lewthwaite, who was married to London 7/7 suicide bomber Germaine Lindsay, had been on the run ever since she was linked to a failed plot to blow up hotels and a shopping centre in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2011.
The mum-of-four has reportedly been seen across Kenya and Somalia after allegedly becoming a top commander within al-Shabaab — the terror gang behind the Nairobi mall atrocity, when at least 67 people died in September last year.
Interpol made her world’s most wanted woman terrorist after her involvement in a Nairobi Mall attack.
Reports last month had said that she had joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and was one of its most prominent female fighters.
However, experts said the latest claims could be plausible if it was found Lewthwaite travelled to Ukraine to join radical Islamists fighting against Russia.
The White Widow’s dad, former British soldier Andrew Lewthwaite, 58, said at his house in Aylesbury, Bucks: “I have heard nothing. No one has told me anything. I’m not saying anything.”
Reports of her death came amid masses of propaganda from Moscow and Kiev over the Ukrainian crisis. And counter-terrorism expert Prof Anthony Glees said the claims could be a “diversion” by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Oct WPI inflation dips to 5-yr low of 1.77% | Rate cut on the anvilfood articles
(While primary articles…)
NEW DELHI: Falling food and commodity prices saw wholesale inflation easing to a five-year low in October, putting more pressure on Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan to cut interest rates to stimulate demand and investment at the December 2 monetary policy announcement.
Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) slowed to 1.77% in October from 2.38% in September, the sixth successive month of decline and the lowest since September 2009, data released by the commerce department on Friday showed.
Consumer inflation, the price gauge more closely watched by the RBI, eased to a multi-year low of 5.52% in October, according to data released on Wednesday.
Rajan has left the key repo rate unchanged at 8% after raising it by 25 basis points in January, but could find it challenging to hew to his tough monetary stance given that retail inflation is well below RBI's March 2015 target of 8% and lower than the 6% limit set for January 2016.
"There could be a strong case for the RBI to consider a rate cut given the continuous decline in the CPI (consumer price index) and WPI inflation numbers in the last few months," Care Ratings said in a note. India's economy expanded 5.7% in the April-June quarter, the most in more than two years, but the revival is still uncertain. The government will be keenly watching monetary policy, which has been a source of friction between RBI and North Block under the previous government.
Industrial production was up only 2.5% in September, ending a dismal quarter, with July production rising 0.41% and August up 0.48%. Production of consumer durables, an indicator of demand, fell 11.3% in September. Car sales didn't perk up during the festival season, dropping 2.55% in October.
Some experts have already lowered their GDP forecast for the year following the softer quarter of industrial growth.
Industry reiterated its demand for a rate cut.
  "This (decline in inflation) provides sufficient room to the RBI to review its prolonged pause in policy rates and move towards policy easing in its forthcoming monetary policy, especially as investment and consumption demand are yet to show visible signs of a pick-up," the Confederation of Indian Industry lobby group said in a statement. Industry has blamed high interest rates for poor housing and consumer goods demand besides softer investments.
Rajan has been unambiguous in his view that the RBI wants to overcome inflation once and for all, instead of relenting on its campaign at the first sign of prices easing. That's why most experts don't expect a rate cut next month, although markets are already pricing in precisely such a move with bond yields trending lower and interest-rate sensitive sectors such as banking and real estate rising sharply on stock exchanges in the last 30 days.
Some analysts suggest that the central bank will wait for the budget in February to get a sense of the government's finances and a better idea of where commodity prices are heading before deciding on interest rates.
"While RBI is likely to draw comfort from the recent softening of inflationary momentum, it is expected to lean on the side of caution and ease policy rates only when there are credible signs that the structural drivers of inflation have turned sanguine," said Shubhada Rao, chief economist, YES Bank.
"If the pace of decline in global commodity prices sustains, we expect pect the rate-cutting cycle to begin as soon as April. We continue to expect a cumulative of 50 basis points repo rate cut during the course of FY16," she added.
The waning of the base effect-high inflation in 2013 has amplified the decline this year- from December is also one of the reasons RBI may wait, preferring to see how it pans out from January.
Food inflation fell to 2.7% in October from 3.52% in the previous month, with vegetable prices facing 19.6% deflation. "Although headline WPI is likely to remain sub-3% in the remainder of FY15, food inflation is expected to rear up as the base effect fades away," said Aditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA.
While deflation in onion prices deepened in October to 60%, inflation in potato rates eased marginally to 82.11%. Core inflation, tracked by RBI, eased to a 13-month low of 2.55% in October from 2.81% in September.

Anshu Jain gives thumbs-up to govt s smart city approach | Coming soon: 2 smart citiesAnshu Jain
(Sentiment plays a very important…)
In an interview with ET Now, Anshu Jain, co-CEO, Deutsche AG , shares his macroeconomic outlook and talks about the opportunities and challenges that urbanisation in India does throw up. Excerpts:
ET Now: Sentiment seems to be looking up, everybody wants to talk about India. Is India back on the radar? Is this optimism really justified?
Anshu Jain: Sentiment plays a very important role in economies. The mood and optimism on India have definitely picked up.
ET Now: How do we see India's optimism being played out from an outside perspective?
Anshu Jain: The view on India from outside the country, particularly from investors into India, has definitely turned around and in the last six months represents a new level of optimism towards the economy.
ET Now: Growth is slowly beginning to pick up, inflation has cooled off. Will India become an emerging market darling once again? We were on the radar, we slipped. Are we back on the radar as far as emerging markets are concerned?
Anshu Jain: Certainly, the short-term performance of the equity markets suggests so.
ET Now: Are equity markets running ahead of macroeconomic fundamentals?
Anshu Jain: They can sometimes. Time will tell whether that is true for India or not.
ET Now: I particularly want to talk to you about this reform thrust of the government. You come from one of the biggest bankers in the world. The question that one would want to ask you at this stage is, given the majority that this government had, are banking sector reforms something that should be high on their radar?
Anshu Jain: They are high on their radar. We had the fortune of the Finance Minister presenting to us at a conclave and he made it fairly clear that if India is going to fund its growth, then getting the banks back on track and making sure that their balance sheets are capable of expansion is one of his priorities.
ET Now: You are particularly here to discuss urbanisation in India and the challenges that it throws up. This government is very serious about it, it is talking about smart cities, it is talking about bullet trains. Something that has not really been said in the public space so much and because you are particularly speaking about this topic, if I may ask you, what are the opportunities and challenges that urbanisation in India does throw up?
Anshu Jain: Urbanisation would be the greatest opportunity and also one of the big challenges that India is going to face. It is an opportunity because in order to create wealth, it has been fairly demonstrable that as people moved from rural areas into cities, there is a wealth effect which takes place.
In India and China alone, 500 million people, that is twice the population of the United States, will move from rural areas into cities. The government is right to be very focused on urbanization, but equally large cities like the one we are standing in right now also have some tremendous challenges. So pulling together best practice is something which should be smart and the government is right to put it right at the top.
ET Now: What are of the best practices that India can learn from some of the most developed cities in the world?
Anshu Jain: Urban age is our attempt and we are trying to get not just lessons from the developed cities, but indeed a lot of the developing cities. We were in Rio, we were in Mexico City and the fact is that when you take these very large urban clusters, particularly in the developing world, there is a lot they can share with each other.

WASHINGTON: US President Barack Obama has commended the personal leadership role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in finding a forward path on the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.
"The President had extensive discussions with Prime Minister Modi on this issue and appreciates his personal leadership in finding a path forward," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement after India and US announced that the two countries have reached an agreement on TFA.
In Myanmar , where Obama met Prime Minister Modi briefly on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit described the Indian leader "as a man of action".
Earnest said the important breakthrough reached between the United States and India will unlock the progress toward the full and immediate implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement , which will lower the costs of trade for developed and developing countries alike.
"This breakthrough will also strengthen the multilateral trading system and give a boost to its ongoing work, including in the area of food security," he said.
Earnest said this has been a good week for expanding opportunities for American businesses and workers and for promoting growth around the globe.
The US agreed to India's proposal on food security issues at WTO yesterday, a development that will pave the way for a breakthrough to end the three-month long stalemate.
The agreement came two days ahead of the G20 Summit in Australia, which will be attended by Prime Minister Modi and other world leaders including Obama.
As per the agreement, the US will support India's proposal at WTO that 'peace clause', crucial for uninterrupted implementation of India's food security programme, should continue indefinitely till a permanent solution is found.
This will enable India to continue procurement and stocking of foodgrain for distribution to poor under its food security programme without attracting any kind of action from WTO members even if it breaches the 10 per cent subsidy cap as prescribed by the multilateral trade body.

Saradha scam: Kunal Ghosh stable after suicide bid; sleeping pill mystery continuesComments
Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh, an accused in the multi-crore Saradha scam, took 26 sleeping pills in an alleged suicide bid inside the Kolkata jail where he has been locked up for the past year.
Kunal Ghosh, the CEO of the erstwhile media houses run by Saradha Group, had threatened suicide in front of a judge on Monday unless the influential people named in the scam were not arrested within 72 hours. (PTI Photo)
Ghosh, who was the CEO of Saradha’s media wing at the time the Ponzi scheme at the company unravelled, was rushed to hospital where doctors said his condition was stable.
The one-time close confidant of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had threatened this week to end his life if the CBI failed to take action against others involved in the scam.
Jail authorities filed an FIR against Ghosh as attempted suicide is a criminal offence.
"According to a complaint lodged by jail authorities, a case has been registered against Kunal Ghosh u/s section 309 of IPC," said Rajeev Mishra, joint commissioner (headquarters) of Kolkata Police.
A hospital official said Ghosh told doctors in the emergency department that he had consumed 26 pills.
“A six-member medical board has been formed to treat him. He is stable now. The team will decide when to discharge him,” said Pradip Mitra, director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research. “The contents of his stomach have been sent for forensic test.”
Prison officials failed to explain how the suspended Trinamool Congress leader managed to procure the sedatives despite being lodged in a high-security cell at the Presidency jail with two guards keeping watch.
“He was extremely depressed even during the last hearing (on Monday). We informed the court too. It is surprising how sedatives find their way inside the jail,” said Ghosh's lawyer, Soumyajit Raha.
Three letters were found in Ghosh's jail cell, sources said. One was addressed to the Chief Justice of India, another to the chief justice of the Calcutta High Court and the third to Saradha investors.
The chief minister suspended the jail superintendent as well as the doctor and nurse on duty while the state government set up a committee to probe the incident.
The incident triggered a torrent of questions from opposition leaders who said there could be a conspiracy to eliminate Ghosh by the real architects of the scam.
“If Kunal dies who will benefit? They will be senior Trinamool Congress leaders against whom he has been spilling the beans for a long time. People will take this incident as a conspiracy,” said senior state Congress leader Abdul Mannan.
The Saradha scam has turned into a major embarrassment for Trinamool chief Banerjee who has been accused by opposition parties of trying to shield some of the beneficiaries of the company’s slush funds.
The scam was caused by the collapse of an investment operation from the Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private firms that was running many unlicensed financial schemes in eastern India.
The group folded up in April last year, resulting in the loss of hundreds of crores to thousands of investors — largely from rural areas with little access to banking facilities.
During a court hearing in September, Ghosh said he was being unjustly kept behind bars while bigger beneficiaries of the scam were inaugurating community Durga Puja ceremonies.
Early on Friday, a guard deployed outside Ghosh’s cell saw the MP unconscious and informed jail officials. The local police were called and Ghosh was taken to hospital.

Wholesale inflation drops to 5-year low over fall in food pricesIndia's wholesale price inflation dropped to a five year low of 1.77% in October over continuing decline in food prices, including vegetables.
The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was at 2.38% in September and 7.24% in October 2013.
As per data released by the government on Friday, the food inflation fell to a nearly two-and-half year low of 2.7%.
Food inflation is on decline since May. The sharp drop in WPI inflation, which fell for the fifth month in a row, came at the back of retail inflation declining to a record low of 5.52% in October.
The rate of price rise in onion contracted 59.77% as compared to a contraction of 58.12% in September.
In case of vegetables, the contraction was 19.61%, while in protein rich items of egg, meat and fish it was 2.58% in October.
During the month, inflation in potato stood at 82.11%, against 90.23% in the previous month.
Inflation in manufactured products, like sugar, edible oils, beverages and cement, fell to 2.43% in October as against 2.84% in the previous month.
The August WPI inflation was revised higher to 3.85% from 3.74% earlier, the data said. Inflation in the fuel and power segment which include LPG, petrol and diesel declined to 0.43 % as compared to price rise of 1.33% in September.
The Reserve Bank which maintained status quo in interest rate since January, will come out with the monetary policy review on December 2. The RBI factors in retail inflation while formulating its monetary policy.
Slowing inflation builds case for RBI rate cut 
The decline in both retail and WPI inflation for October, coupled with improvement in industrial output for September, will put pressure on the RBI to lower interest rates to boost growth.
An uptick in manufacturing and capital goods pushed industrial output to a three-month high of 2.5% in September. Industry has been demanding easing of interest rates to boost growth, which has slumped to 4.7% in 2013-14.
The economy is estimated to grow in the range of 5.4-5.9% this fiscal.
Friday's data comes days after consumer price inflation had dropped to 5.52 percent in October, below the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 6 percent target for January 2016.
"With inflation at or under 6 percent we think RBI is likely to face pressure to ease, not just from the government, but also from RBI's own policy committee," said Devika Mehndiratta, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in Singapore.
She expects retail inflation to hit a low of close to 4 percent in November, opening up an opportunity for a 25 basis points interest rate cut in the second quarter of 2015.
Indian businesses have been pleading for a cut in interest rates, which are among the highest in Asia, to stimulate consumption in a domestic demand-driven economy.
Consumer goods output - a proxy for consumer demand that drives 60 percent of India's economy - has grown in just two of the last 21 months. It fell an annual 4.0 percent in September.
The RBI is meeting on Dec. 2 to review policy, having kept its key repo rate steady at 8.0 percent since January.
A Reuters poll last month had shown that economists expected rates to be held unchanged until well into next year, due to worries that price pressures would revive once a favourable base effect fades out and food prices rise after a poor summer rains.
Bond traders are betting on one of the biggest interest rate reductions among major emerging markets once the rate cutting cycle begins.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield had dropped 36 basis points since Oct. 1 until the last session on hopes of a rate cut.
 

Delhi is denser and safer than New York: ReportFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
New Delhi has high average density of built up area, nearly twice the levels of wider New York metro area despite the Indian capital’s relatively low-rise urban landscape, a research report prepared by London School of Economics has said.
“Comparing Delhi’s urban dynamics to the eight other Urban Age cities – London, Bogota, Lagos, Tokyo, New York, Istanbul and Berlin- highlights that despite the capital’s relatively low-rise urban landscape, it has an extremely high average density of built up area of 19,698 people per square kilometre.
“This is nearly twice the levels for wider New York metro area (which at 11,531 people/sq km includes high-rise Manhattan), the research report which was released today said.
The report also said Delhi scores well in having a very low level of violent crime measured by the murder rate (homicides per 100,000 people), than New York and Istanbul.
The research has been carried out in preparation of the two-day conference on Urban Age ‘Governing Urban Futures’ which started here today.
The conference is being organised by ‘LSE Cities’ at the London School of Economics and Political Science and Deutsche Bank’s Alfred Herrhausen Society in partnership with the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).
Speaking on the occasion, Deutsche Bank AG Co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain said,”Today, cities account for 2 per cent of the world’s landmass but produce 80 per of global wealth. Over the next 30 years, one third of the world’s economic growth will be generated in the top 100 cities.”
Quoting the McKinsey Global Institute report, Jain said, “India needs to build the equivalent of a new Chicago every year for the next few decades to sustain its growth.”
“That’s why the Indian government’s ‘100 Smart Cities’ initiative is so important,” he added.

Bombay HC stays quotas for Marathas  MuslimsFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The Bombay High Court today stayed implementation of the controversial decision of the erstwhile Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra to provide reservation to Marathas in government jobs and educational institutions announced ahead of the state Assembly election.
It also stayed the decision to provide five per cent reservation to Muslims in government service but allowed quotas for them in educational institutions.
Admitting a batch of Public Interest Litigations, a bench headed by Chief Justice Mohit Shah said the Supreme Court had already laid down the law for reservation which cannot exceed 50 per cent of the total seats.
52 per cent seats in government jobs and educational institutions were already reserved for the targeted groups and the Congress-NCP government had, in the run up to the Assembly poll, raised it to 73 per cent by announcing 16 per cent quotas for Marathas and five per cent for Muslims.
The court was of the view that the comparative data provided by the government justified its decision to introduce reservation for Muslims in government educational institutions. It, however, excluded private educational bodies from the purview of reservations for the minority community.
The government defended its decision on reservation to Marathas and Muslims contending that the two communities were socially and educationally backward and also economically poor. It said the decision was based on the report of a committee headed by former minister Narayan Rane set up to look into the issue.
The government said it had taken into consideration recommendations of Rajinder Sachar Committee and Mahmoodur Rahman Committee, both of which had recommended reservation for Muslims, while arriving at the decision to provide quotas for them.
The PILs challenging reservation for the two communities were filed by social activist Ketan Tirodkar, an NGO Youth for Equality, Anil Thanekar, I S Gilada of Indian Health Organisation and others.
Senior advocate Pradeep Sancheti, appearing for Youth for Equality, referred to the Supreme Court’s guidelines on reservations which said it cannot exceed 50 per cent of the total seats.
He also contended that it cannot be granted on the basis of religion.
Sancheti said the state government had not provided comparative data about population and backwardness of Muslims and Marathas vis-a-vis other communities. He questioned the government’s decision to introduce reservations “in a hurry” when Assembly elections were due.
Tirodkar and other petitioners, opposing the reservations, argued that Marathas and Muslims were not backward Communities.
Tirodkar contended that 75 per cent of cooperative sugar factories and as many of educational institutions in Maharashtra were controlled by Marathas. Also, they owned nearly 75 per cent of the land in the state.
Citing a report of the National Commission for Backward Classes in year 2000, he said Marathas were socially advanced and thus cannot be included in the list of backward classes.
He said the Commission, while rejecting the claim of Marathas for inclusion in the list of backward classes, said they had played a pioneering role in shaping socio-cultural and political history of modern Maharashtra and had been in the forefront of many spheres of the state’s development.

Saradha scam: BJP seeks CBI probe into Kunal Ghoshs suicideattemptPrint
Written by Liz Mathew | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:37 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 2:42 pm
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday sought a CBI inquiry into the suicide attempt by Kunal Ghosh , the suspended Trinamool Congress MP who was arrested in Saradha chit fund scam.
Ghosh has attempted suicide by consuming sleeping pills in his prison cell.
The BJP, which has been vocal on the issue, alleged that many had suspected political motive behind the arrest of Kunal Ghosh because he had started to expose senior TMC leaderships involvement in Shardha Chit fund scam. Pointing out that Ghosh, former CEO of Saradha Media Group, had threatened he would commit suicide if TMC leaders like Mukul Roy and Madan Mitra were not arrested, BJP national secretary and West Bengal in charge, Sidharth Nath Singh said: “CBI being independent will follow their own line of investigation, however what is alarming is that Bengal police and the jail authorities allowed Kunal Ghosh to commit suicide inside the jail after he had already made his intention clear.”
“Since Kunal Ghosh is a prime witness to Shardha scam it was imperative for Bengal police to be more alert and should have monitored 24×7 Kunal Ghosh. Therefore the approach of Jail authorities raises further questions, whether it was suicide attempt or political conspiracy to suppress the evidence? Also it is important to know how the drugs slipped into his room,” Singh asked in a statement.
“BJP demands that CBI should investigate also the suicide attempt of Kunal Ghosh and under the process of law ensure a safer custody of Shardha scam’s prime witness,” he added.

(The Chinese e-commerce…)
By Myles Udland
Alibaba will be issuing debt.
In filings with the SEC on Thursday, the Chinese e-commerce giant disclosed plans to issue senior debt to US investors in order to refinance its existing credit facilities.
A report from Bloomberg's Sridhar Natarajan and Zijing Wu, citing two people familiar with the deal, Alibaba is planning to raise up to $8 billion in the offering.
Ratings agencies Fitch and S&P both assigned 'A+' ratings to Alibaba's corporate credit rating. S&P cited the company's "dominant market position in e-commerce in China and the company's minimal financial leverage."
Fitch also described Alibaba's market position as "dominant" and said, "The large size and potential for sustainable growth in China's online shopping market help mitigate Alibaba's limited geographical diversification."
This planned offering comes about two months after the company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in the largest IPO in NYSE history.
Natarajan and Wu reported that Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and JPMorgan will manage the offering.
Singles Day in China was earlier this week, which is similar to the Black Friday or Cyber Monday shopping holidays in the US, and Alibaba announced that it pulled in a record $9.3 billion in sales, a record for the company. Last year, Alibaba's Singles Day sales totaled $5.8 billion.
Earlier on Thursday, Alibaba shares were trading at a record high, just below $120, but in afternoon trade were down about 2% to $115.75.

India Overtakes China in Gold Demand
Reuters | Updated On: November 13, 2014 15:18 (IST)
Brent Falls Below $69 as Price Rout Rolls On
Indian appetite for gold jumped by more than a third in the last quarter, in sharp contrast to the rest of the world, boosted by jewellery demand for the wedding season, an industry body said on Thursday.
Demand in India rose 39 per cent to 225.1 tonnes in July-September, the second highest on record for the quarter, even as global appetite fell to its lowest in nearly five years, according to the World Gold Council.
Consumption in the world's other major buyer, China, tumbled 37 per cent year-on-year in the same period. Although Indian demand overtook China for the quarter, it still lagged for the total from the first nine months of the year.
"Demand will continue to have positive growth over last year as this is a good demand period and a lot of marriages are happening," said Somasundaram PR, head of the WGC's India operations.
Jewellery demand in India surged 60 per cent in the third quarter, but investment demand eased 10 per cent.
The WGC maintained its prediction that Indian demand would reach 850-950 tonnes for the year, driven by jewellery purchases.
Investment demand is likely to fall to 25 per cent of total demand this year, from 37 per cent the year before, Somasundaram said, as a sharp price drop has shaken the confidence of Indians in bullion as a store of value.
The WGC said jewellery demand was also boosted by a weakening of gold prices in rupee terms and the onset of the festival season.
September imports surged 450 per cent to $3.75 billion.
"Demand for the fourth quarter as a whole is expected to be healthy, but the September surge in imports is unlikely to be replicated," WGC said.
The jump in Indian demand comes after a weaker period last year when consumption was hurt by curbs on imports.
Struggling with a high trade deficit, India last year raised its gold import duty to a record 10 per cent and made it mandatory to export a fifth of all bullion imports.

Mulayam daughter-in-law praises Modis Swachh Bharat campaignPrint
Aparna Yadav
Written by Mohd Faisal Fareed | Lucknow | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:55 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 12:56 am
Differing from Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav’s views, Mulayam Singh Yadav’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav has has come out in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’, saying that Modi is the country’s Prime Minister and cannot be confined only to the BJP anymore.
“It is a good initiative by Modi. Everyone should be concerned about cleanliness. But, there should be a proper module for implementing the campaign,” Aparna Yadav told The Indian Express.
Aparna, who is the wife of Akhilesh’s younger brother Prateek, had also supported the campaign while attending an Akhil Bhartiya Adhikar Sangthan seminar in Lucknow on Wednesday. “I had said the same thing during the seminar when I was asked by some journalists. I attended the programme as a social worker,” she said.
When it was pointed out that the Samajwadi Party is politically pitted against Modi, Aparna said Modi is no longer confined to the BJP. “He is the PM for whole country,” she said.
Aparna said she is aware that her remarks will put Akhilesh in tight spot, since several of his ministers have ridiculed the campaign, but said she had the right to differ from the party’s view. “I am part of the family not the party. I have my own standing as a social worker,” she said.
She, however, denied media reports claiming that she had countered the Akhilesh government on various occasions, including in her stand on 1090 women’s helpline, a brain child of Akhilesh Yadav. She had reportedly stated that police control room number 100 is better than 1090.
The activist also had her own suggestions for the campaign: “Only symbolic cleanliness will not go a long way. There should be a proper module, a detailed project report about managing the cleanliness work in cities which also brings more employment”.

Kunal Ghosh claimed that he has taken sleeping pills. The doctors found everything to be normal but as a precautionary measure they have admitted him to a hospital.
Suspended Trinamool Congress MP and Saradha scam accused Kunal Ghosh was rushed to the city’s SSKM hospital early on Friday morning after he allegedly tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills.
Dr Pradip Mitra, SSKM Director, told reporters that Ghosh was in a drowsy state when he was brought to the hospital from the Presidency Correctional Home. “His condition is stable now. His stomach was washed and the samples have been sent for forensic examination,” Dr. Mitra told journalists.
Making a statement in the Assembly at mid-day, the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced the suspension of the jail superintendent, a senior medical officer and a prison guard.
She said a committee headed by Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee would inquire into the incident and the jail staff would remain suspended till then.
Describing Ghosh’s condition as “absolutely stable”, she said, “At 2 a.m., he himself complained of uneasiness. He also walked,” she said.
While jail sources told The Hindu that Ghosh had taken “three pills”, media reports quoting various sources suggested he had consumed “50-60 pills”. The Chief Minister said in Assembly that doctors attending him have said he “does not seem to have taken so many sleeping pills”.
The jail authorities have reportedly filed a case against Ghosh under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code for attempt to suicide.
Earlier this week Ghosh had said in court that he would commit suicide if the “real culprits” behind the Saradha ponzi scam are not put behind bars. He gave the administration and the judiciary “three days time” to nab the real culprits.
Ms. Banerjee also expressed displeasure with Minister of Correctional Administration Haider Aziz Safwi and he is likely to be relieved of his duty. According to AITC sources, Ms Banerjee was not satisfied with retired IPS officer, Mr Safwi's performance as a Minister. She is also expected to make few changes in her cabinet over the weekend.
Meanwhile, national secretary and observer in West Bengal of the Bharatiya Janata Party Siddhartha Nath Singh crticised the jail authorities for mishandling the situation and wondered whether there is a “political motive behind letting him commit suicide”.

He is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday wowed students of a leading Australian university, freely mingling with them during a visit, and made it a point to tell them that it is former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s birth anniversary, as he sent his best wishes to children.
Within hours after his arrival following an overnight flight from Myanmar, Modi headed for the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) for the first engagement of his five-day Australia visit, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 28 years after Rajiv Gandhi.
“I wrote on the selfie with my young friends at QUT.. Today is 14th November. Pandit Nehru’s birthday. My good wishes to children,” Modi said in a tweet. Modi wrote in Gujarati.
The Prime Minister, wearing a lab coat over a full-sleeved white shirt and a beige coloured pant, said he is fortunate to be among children on the occasion of Nehru’s birthday.
Modi has been accused by the Congress of ignoring the country’s first Prime Minister and appropriating the legacy of freedom movement leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel.
The Prime Minister, who is in Australia for the G20 summit starting tomorrow and for bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott next Tuesday in Canberra, was given a guided tour of the QUT campus and interacted with a group of selected students, some of whom were Indians.
Several students could not hide their enthusiasm and turned into shutterbugs as they relentlessly took photos.
The enthusiastic response to Modi’s visit to QUT prompted a post on the University media’s twitter handle —— “Perhaps the most high-powered lecture QUT has hosted.”
Agro Robot
Modi was also shown an agriculture robot ‘AgBot’ at the University’s ‘The Cube’ complex —— the University’s Science and Engineering Centre —— developed under a joint bio-energy programme using agriculture waste.
The Agro Robot, developed as part of a programme to develop robotics technology in the agriculture sector, is a light weight machine that performs the functions of a large tractor, including weeding work.
“Research is key to development. There is ongoing relationship between development journey of humankind and research. Increasing dominance of science and technology in the field of agriculture will surely prove to be beneficial to farmers and to the field of agriculture as a whole. It is an important endeavor for welfare of mankind. Best wishes for your effort,” Modi wrote on the ‘AgBot’ in Gujarati.

Nehru integrity can t be doubted: Rajnathceremony
‘There could be disagreements with his policies, though’
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday that there could be disagreements with former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s policies, but his integrity could not be doubted.
Mr. Singh was speaking at the inaugural function of the 125th birth anniversary commemoration of Nehru at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library.
“Nehru trusted the intelligence of the people and hence promoted democracy. People considered Indian democracy as one for the elite and thought that only one family can rule this country. But it is in this very Indian democracy that an ordinary vote is powerful enough to make a tea-seller the Prime Minister. We don’t agree with his policy on Jammu and Kashmir and many disagree with his China policy. But he was the primary force behind the Non-Aligned Movement,” Mr. Singh said.
We remember Pandit Nehru's efforts during the freedom struggle and his role as the first Prime Minister of India.
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 14, 2014
Minister of State for Culture (Independent Charge) Mahesh Sharma also took a dig at dynastic rule. “This Rashtrapurush (Man of the Nation) is not the heritage of any family or dynasty. Mr. Modi has decided to celebrate a whole year to commemorate Nehru’s birth anniversary. He is still an inspiration to all citizens. Nehru Memorial Museum & Library Director (Mahesh Rangarajan) informed me that our country’s first Council of Ministers had six non-Congressmen.”
Mr. Sharma added that Rs. 20 crore had been sanctioned for the commemoration in 2014-2015.
Mr. Singh launched the Nehru portal, which hosts the first 15 volumes of the former Prime Minister’s collected works and other archival material. He also released two commemorative coins. He praised Nehru for ‘enlisting the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’ in the Integrated Food Production Programme in 1950 and allowing it to march in the 1963 Republic Day Parade.
“Nehru did not oppose any economic ideology. He agreed with socialist and communist ideologies but understood their limitations. He found the mixed economy as an ideal policy. I unequivocally call him a Rashtrapurush and all his works must be studied holistically. All his papers should be collected and the Public Records Rules of 1997 make this possible,” Mr. Singh said.
From Brisbane, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “Tributes to Nehru. We remember Pandit Nehru’s efforts during the freedom struggle and his role as the first Prime Minister of India.”

Good news for eurozone as Germany, France skirt recession

(The clouds over Europe appeared…)
FRANKFURT: The clouds over Europe appeared to lift slightly in the third quarter as its two biggest economies both narrowly escaped a new recession, official data showed on Friday.
In Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 0.1 per cent in the period from July to September, after shrinking by 0.1 per cent in the preceding three months, the federal statistics office said.
And in Paris, a preliminary estimate by the INSEE agency showed the French economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, following a contraction of 0.1 per cent in the second quarter.
Since recession is technically defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP, both France and Germany avoided a new recession.
In Germany's case, positive impulses came primarily from private households, which ramped up their spending strongly, Destatis said.
In addition, foreign trade also provided a support for the economy, with exports rising more strongly than imports, the statement said.
On the negative side, investment declined, particularly in equipment, and construction investment also slipped marginally.
A detailed breakdown of the different GDP components will be published on November 25, Destatis said.
In Paris, France's Finance Minister Michel Sapin said the French data confirmed the government's forecast of 0.4 per cent growth for the full year.
"Economic activity has picked up slightly but remains too weak to ensure the job creation our country needs," Sapin said in a statement.
With growth in both countries still very modest, however, analysts were cautious about the outlook.
"Almost all the glamour of the second German 'Wirtschaftswunder' (economic miracle) seems to be gone," said ING DiBa economist Carsten Brzeski .
Data for the wider eurozone were scheduled for release later on Friday and the chances were that they will show that Germany underperformed the rest of the region, the expert said.
"Since early 2013 the German economy has grown by an average of 0.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter each quarter, making the eurozone's powerhouse rather a one-eyed king in the land of the blind than an economic superman," he said.
Brzeski attributed the German weakness to problems in key trading partner countries such as China, France and Italy. But uncertainty stemming from the ongoing Ukrainian crisis was also another key factor, he said.
"In our view, the German economy is nowhere near any abyss. However, complacency or any trace of high-handedness would be misplaced. The trend of the last quarters signals that the German economy could use a new reform impulse rather sooner than later," he concluded.

Maratha reservations: Maha Govt to approach Supreme Court  says DevendraFadnavisPrint
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: November 14, 2014 3:10 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 6:54 pm
The Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday said the government will appeal in Supreme Court against the Bombay High Court’s decision to disallow 16 per cent reservation to Maratha community in public services and education. However, court has stayed the reservation for Muslims in education but not in public services.
Fadnavis said, “ My government is committed to the reservation for Maratha community. If there are certain discrepancies in the law pointed by High Court, we will take measures to make the necessary corrections. The lacuna will be addressed to ensure the quota for Maratha community comes into force.” Fadnavis said, “ The shortcoming in the laws will be taken up during the winter session of state legislative assembly beginning in Nagpur on December 8.”
The HC ruling against Maratha reservation is going to have a wider political ramifications as opposition parties Congress-NCP will use it against the ruling BJP government. This was evident as former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said, “ We want the new government to clear its stand on Maratha quota. The Congress will study to HC order. We will fully support Maratha reservation as final hearing in of January 5.” The Shiv Sena leader Diwakar Raote wondered, “ Why government could not present the case properly to ensure the justification of the reservation.” NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik argued, “If the court’s has stayed the reservation it raises question on how the matter was presented by government in court.”
Notwithstanding, the political posturing, leaders of Congress, NCP, Sena admit, “ The biggest hurdle ahead is to get the constitutional and legal sanction for the Maratha quota.”
The controversial Maratha reservation was pushed by the Congress-NCP government ahead of the crucial Maharashtra assembly elections with an objective to win over the support of Maratha community which constitute 30 per cent of the state population. After a major defeat in 2014, Lok Sabha elections, NCP president Sharad Pawar urged the state government to go ahead with reservation politics –Marathas and Muslims. Chavan government wa also blamed by NCP for not bringing the quota before the Lok Sabha polls.
Even when the Congress-NCP government gave its approval for Maratha quota, state legal department had expressed its objections arguing, “The decision may not withstand the constitutional and legal sanction.”
A senior officer on conditions of anonymity revealed to Indian Express, “ The Narayan Rane committee report which was the basis for pushing the Maratha reservation quota has inbuilt flaws. The survey appears an exercise undertaken in haste without adequately substantiating the data to prove what percentage of Marathas are economically backward or how they can be given the status of socially backward.”
According to Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of B R Ambedkar, “ The Congress-NCP government’s approval to Maratha reservation was to restore the confidence of Maratha community which was disenchanted with the ruling combine.” Ambedkar said, “ The fate of reservation was on expected lines and Marathas cannot be considered as socially or economically backward community in state.”
Interestingly, Maratha reservation has been discussed in the state and continued…

Slum dwellers attacked Alipore policestationPrint
By: Express News Service | Kolkata | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:50 pm
In another instance of ‘thana attack’ trend in Bengal, an irate mob on Friday attacked Alipore police station, one of the most posh area in south Kolkata and located at a security zone with West Bengal police head quarter near by. The mob from a local slum today barged into the police station beating the guards at the gate of the police station. The mob later entered the police station premises and started throwing stones at the office.
Tension gripped the area after a PWD team went to a local slum to vacate the vested land of the state government that was encroached by the locals. When the PWD team accompanied by police personnel asked the slum dwellers to relocate at some other place, they started agitating in the area and claimed they were given ‘patta’ by the Left Front government. However, the eviction process did not start at that time.
To control the agitation in the area, police picked up at least 10 protesters and brought them to the police station which was followed by the mob outrage. A strong mob led by a couple of local TMC leaders entered the police station premises and tried to ransack the police station as there were a few police personnel present at the spot. Clips of police personnel trying to hide under the tables to escape the attack were telecast in the local channels.
In minutes, reinforcement rushed to the spot and chased the mob away from the police station premises, though the mob later blocked the road in front of Bhawani Bhavan, head quarter of West Bengal police and CID. The crowd was dispersed soon from the area and blockade was withdrawn after senior police and PWD officials spoke to them.

Here come Alibaba bonds...
Business Insider Nov 14, 2014, 03.00PM IST
(The Chinese e-commerce…)
By Myles Udland
Alibaba will be issuing debt.
In filings with the SEC on Thursday, the Chinese e-commerce giant disclosed plans to issue senior debt to US investors in order to refinance its existing credit facilities.
A report from Bloomberg's Sridhar Natarajan and Zijing Wu, citing two people familiar with the deal, Alibaba is planning to raise up to $8 billion in the offering.
Ratings agencies Fitch and S&P both assigned 'A+' ratings to Alibaba's corporate credit rating. S&P cited the company's "dominant market position in e-commerce in China and the company's minimal financial leverage."
Fitch also described Alibaba's market position as "dominant" and said, "The large size and potential for sustainable growth in China's online shopping market help mitigate Alibaba's limited geographical diversification."
This planned offering comes about two months after the company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in the largest IPO in NYSE history.
Natarajan and Wu reported that Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and JPMorgan will manage the offering.
Singles Day in China was earlier this week, which is similar to the Black Friday or Cyber Monday shopping holidays in the US, and Alibaba announced that it pulled in a record $9.3 billion in sales, a record for the company. Last year, Alibaba's Singles Day sales totaled $5.8 billion.
Earlier on Thursday, Alibaba shares were trading at a record high, just below $120, but in afternoon trade were down about 2% to $115.75.

Pawar cleans  BJP fumesUpdated: November 14, 2014 23:49 IST
Pawar launches Swachh campaign in Baramati

NCP initiative aimed at curbing spread of dengue, says party chief
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), on Friday made another gesture of intent to support the initiatives of the Narendra Modi government with the entire family of the party chief Sharad Pawar including the Maratha strong man trooping onto the streets of Baramati town with brooms kicking off Prime Minister Narendra Modi's `swach bharat' campaign.
Significantly, the Pawar clan cleanliness drive coincided with the official launch the Clean India campaign by the BJP in Maharashtra, with its Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in the state in the forefront.
The NCP neatly torpedoed the Shiv Sena's endeavour to strike a deal with the BJP on its participation in the Fadnavis government with its support to the BJP on October 19 even as the results were trickling in for the recently concluded state assembly election.
Mr. Pawar, sporting an anti-pollution mask, symbolically brandished a broomstick, with a few flourishes to the dust of Baramati.
But even as Mr. Fadnavis’ show was dubbed as a political drama with charges that the Chief Minister was sweeping a road made garbage-free well in advance, the drive launched by the Pawar family in their stronghold Baramati in Pune district stole the BJP’s thunder.

Among the other family members of the Pawar who were cited on the roads include Mr. Pawar’s nephew and former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister, Ajit Pawar and daughter Supriya Sule.
Addressing reporters, Mr. Pawar said party is keen to end the dengue epidemic which has gripped Baramati.
“Two persons have died here as a result of dengue. From now on, every Monday will see a cleanliness drive by every citizen of Baramati,” he said.
The NCP initiative has irked a section of BJP workers with party activists in Ahmednagar district dismissing the move as a cheap stunt by Mr. Pawar to be overtly on the side of the BJP.
BJP workers in Ahmednagar’s Shrirampur tehsil held a ‘self-introspection’ meet where they urged the party brass to distance themselves from the NCP and protested against their party’s murky policy of quietly tolerating the NCP support.
“We[the BJP] have come to power in the State only by exposing the NCP’s crimes. Even if we are short of a majority, why must we seek their unsolicited support? It is obvious to one and all that Sharad Pawar’s game is to protect the skins of tainted NCP leaders. For this, he can stoop to any level,” said a BJP leader from Ahmednagar.

SEBI to implement CAS from March 2015Updated: November 12, 2014 23:13 IST
SEBI to implement CAS from March 2015
Oommen A. Ninan
securities
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), on Wednesday said that it would enable a single consolidated view of all investments of every investor in mutual funds and securities held in demat form with depositories from March 2015.
 Consolidation of account statement would be done on the basis of permanent account number (PAN) and in case of multiple holding, it would be PAN of the first holder and pattern of holding.
 The Consolidated Account Statement (CAS) for all securities would “create one record for all financial assets of every individual,” said SEBI in a circular to all the depositories, asset management companies and mutual fund RTAs. “This is the first step in this direction,” SEBI added.
 However, the capital market regulator said that if an investor does not wish to receive CAS, an option would be given to the investor. “Depositories shall accordingly inform investors in their statements from the month of January 2015 about the facility of CAS and provide them with information on how to opt out of the facility if they do not wish to avail it,” SEBI said.
 Further SEBI said that AMCs/ RTAs would share the requisite information with the depositories on monthly basis to enable generation of CAS.
 Based on the PANs provided by the AMCs/MF-RTAs, the depositories would match their PAN database to determine the common PANs and allocate the PANs among themselves for the purpose of sending CAS. 

An app that lets you buy and keep discounted gift cards on your phone0
Raise takes 15 percent of the sale price of the card, charging the seller, Bousis said. The company says funds get transferred in 1 to 3 business days to the seller’s bank account.
The app gives sellers market data, telling them how much cards from the same store are selling for. Bousis said this keeps discounts competitive, as sellers looking for fast cash will price cards lower than competitors.
The platform also creates a virtual password-protected wallet for purchased gift cards, allowing users to track the cards they’ve bought and how much they’ve saved on purchases, the company said.
Raise is backed by $18.1 million in Series A funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, led by Jeremy Levine, known for his early investments in LinkedIn, Pinterest and Yelp. The company secured that investment last December and disclosed it this week, Bousis said.
CORRECTION: This version reflects that the Raise platform has been running online since February 2013.

India s industrial output jumps 2.5%  inflation easesIndia's industrial output jumps 2.5%, inflation eases
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 12, 2014

Comments
India’s retail inflation fell to a three year low of 5.52% in October and industrial output rebounded to 2.5% in September, rekindling hopes that cooling prices will nudge the RBI to cut lending rates leading to lower EMIs in its monetary policy next month.
The data came out on a day when India’s share markets scaled new heights anticipating a string of reforms in the coming weeks.
The Benchmark BSE Sensex for the first time settled above the 28,000 level and NSE Nifty crossed 8,400.
Oil companies may cut further petrol and diesel on plunging global crude oil costs, a move that will aid government's efforts to keep  inflation low and stable.
The more than one percentage point drop in inflation rates over September’s 6.46%, should bring cheer to the NDA government that rode to a landslide election victory promising to bring down prices of essentials as part of its poll pledge to usher in 'Achein din’ (Good days).
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP)—a broad metric to measure activity in factories across the country-- surged in September from a flat 0.4% growth in the previous month buoyed by robust power and capital goods output.
Capital goods output, a proxy for investment activity, grew 11.6% in September mirroring that companies may have begun to add capacity lines expecting demand for goods to pick up.
The manufacturing sector, which constitutes over 75% of India’s total industrial output, grew 2.5% in September compared to a growth of 1.4% a year ago.
The fall in retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI)—a metric that captures shop-end prices, was driven by a fall in food inflation to 5.59% In October from 7.67%. Inflation fell in vegetables, which accounts more than a tenth of the food basket—contracted 1.45%.

Sony MDR-XB950BT headphone review: Good for the ears and great value for moneyPrint
Given the host of features that it boasts, it definitely is a good contender in this mid-range of headphones.
Written by Andrew Clarance | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 2:21 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 2:53 pm
Being a musician, I’m always looking for the perfect sound, that perfect balance of bass, treble and mids. I was a bit skeptical when I got the Sony XB950BT headphones to review. When I saw Extra Bass written across the big Sony box, I imagined this would be standard bass-boost fare. I might add that I am a video editor, and so I was looking at these headphones from the point of how well it helps me achieve the perfect to-visual balance.
Design
The headphones come neatly packed in a sturdy box with the usual micro-USB charging cable and a 1.2mm cable. The black matte finish with streaks of muted red around the cans give these headphones a demure sense of class. Unlike other flashy, brightly-coloured over-priced headphones these don’t draw the eye out, rather they just make a big deal of the ear and therein lies all the difference. Given the typical Indian Commute, with its dust and grime, any bright colour is going to look faded and dirty within weeks. The steel grey band with padding for head support makes it a comfortable wear.
The ergonomic ear-pads are comfortable and trust me when I say this. I usually sit and work on video edits for 4-5 hour stretches. These headphones are over-the-ear cans which are very pleasant to wear unlike some ill designed pieces which end up hurting the ear more than making it a satisfying experience.
The headphone ear-pieces swivel completely on their axis to make it easily foldable. When I was not using them it was easy to hang them around my neck, folded-up flat, cans down – makes all the difference while using the packed-out Metro.
The headphones have a volume toggle, a play/pause toggle, a bass-boost button, a micro-USB port, a EP in and a built-in mic all neatly situated on the edge of the headphone can hiding it from plain sight yet making it easily accessible.
Sound
I put this headphone piece through various levels of sound mixes and music genres. I was keen to see how it would perform in interaction with various environs with differing decibel levels of noise.
Sitting in office, I started off by playing Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in E minor, a ritual I follow when trying out new headphones. Within the first 7 minutes of the first movement, I knew that this set was not going to disappoint. Through the arpeggios of the soloist and the swaying tempo, each instrument in the track was clearly and uniquely decipherable, rich and in full tone, a very satisfying experience.
Through other genres of the quiet understated folk songwriter, independent music and bass heavy hip-hop tracks I liked what I was hearing. Through all the tracks that I played – guitar heavy rock, the soft-nuanced notes of the upright bass or the crisp shrill notes of the trumpet, this headphone set delivered clear, processed rich sound. Coming to vocal heavy music, I tried it with Allegri’s ‘Miserere mei, Deus’ a piece written for two choirs, an a cappella form. It delivered, rendering perfect clear tones, giving that slight bass undertone when the male choir kicked in. The performance on this track really had me impressed.
On the commute back home, I took an auto during peak-hour traffic and did a road-test of sorts. The headphones gave clear clean rich sound, even delivering amazing tones for soft jazz pieces during the loud hustle-bustle of 6.30pm Outer Ring Road traffic.
There are some issues I found while using the headphones. While editing a video project for a phone-review, I found that there was a basic latency. At first I though it was just due to a slow render but when I looked closely I found that were was a 7-10 frame lag. This is possibly due to the onboard processing.
There is another explanation though. While this headphone is apt-
X compatible ( aptX is an audio codec which is designed to encode a CD quality/44.1kHz audio stream without a loss in quality through a high data transfer rate) my MacBook Pro ( OS X Mavericks) is using a SBC audio codec. I’m still trying to figure how to change the codec to apt-X. I also found that the Nexus 5 which I primarily use for music is not apt-X compatible too ( As far as I know).
I found the bass-boost button a bit redundant. Out of the two weeks that I used the headphones I didn’t once need the bass-boost. Instead when I tried it out, the bass-boost just sounded like a badly equalised bass player, drowning out the clarity and sharpness of the entire track. This bass-boost is helpful only in situations where the track is not equalized properly, like home-recordings, etc.
Verdict
Out of the box, the headphones synced to my MacbookPro without any issues whatever. I imagined it would then throw up issues to sync with my Nexus 5 device. It synced with no issues.
The hands-free function with the built in microphone worked with no hassles. I thought that talking mid-traffic on the headphone’s omni-directional mic would produce a channel full of noise but it was relatively clean and crisp. It is a very useful feature especially when you have both your hands full. The only drawback of such a feature I can think of is that I probably looked a bit weird talking to the air!
The battery life is superb. After taking it out of the box, I used for a day and a half before charging it. In the two weeks that I used the headphones I have only charged the headphones twice.
Priced at Rs 10,650 on Flipkart, I feel that this set is good value for money in the mid-price range. Given the host of features that it boasts, it definitely is a good contender in this mid-range of headphones.

Hindalco Q2 Profit Hit by One-Time ProvisionsBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Mumbai: Aluminium and coal producer Hindalco Industries Ltd posted a steep 78 per cent drop in quarterly net profit, hurt by a one-time provision for additional levies related to the deallocation of one of its coal mines.
The Supreme Court in September scrapped over 200 coal blocks allocated since 1993, hurting power, steel and cement companies that had invested heavily in projects around the concessions.
Hindalco posted a net profit of Rs 78.77 crore ($12.8 million) for the three months ended September 30, its second quarter, down from Rs 357 crore, a year earlier.
The profit was hit by exceptional items of Rs 431 crore, which included a Rs 563 crore provision towards an additional levy on coal extracted from a company-operated mine that was deallocated, Hindalco said in a statement.
However, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla conglomerate posted strong operating results with rising production levels boosting net sales 37 per cent to Rs 8473 crore for the quarter.
Hindalco also said it proposed to participate in government auctions for "suitable coal blocks" to meet future coal requirement.
The company's shares ended up 0.3 per cent on BSE Sensex that closed down 0.24 per cent.

Mahindra Plans to Launch Three New Vehicles in 2015
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 13, 2014 18:29 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Auto major Mahindra & Mahindra plans to launch three new vehicles, including two compact SUVs, next year as it looks to strengthen its position in the domestic market.
In the two-wheeler segment, the firm which is in the process of acquiring 51 per cent stake in Peugeot Motocycles for 28 million euros, is eyeing various global markets besides India to launch the French firm's products.
"We were slow on launches in 2013 and 2104. Now we are back with new launches. In 2015, we will launch two sub-4 meter compact SUVs and one light commercial vehicle. All the three would come on completely new platforms," Mahindra & Mahindra executive director Pawan Goenka told reporters.
The company is also in the process of developing new series of engines with its Korean arm Ssangyong, he added.
Earlier this year, M&M had announced plans to invest Rs 4,000 crore at the Chakan plant to take the overall capacity to 7.5 lakh units annually when fully operational. The fresh infusion would take its total investment in Chakan to Rs 8,000 crore.
In 2013, the company had announced plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore in three years.
Commenting on the plans with Peugeot Motocycles, Mr Goenka said: "We are looking at ASEAN region, particularly Vietnam, North African countries and India to launch products from the Peugeot Motocycle portfolio."
He said, however, that it was "hard to say" as to when two-wheelers from Peugeot stable could be launched in India as the current models are expensive.
"The products in their current avatar would not be feasible for India due to pricing. We will have to do some market research as see what products would suit Indian requirements," Mr Goenka added.
Last month, Mahindra Two-Wheelers, a fringe player in the domestic market, had inked a pact to acquire 51 per cent stake for 28 million euro (over Rs 215 crore) in Peugeot Motocycles, part of the 54 billion euro French auto major PSA Group.
He said Mahindra could do a market research after February next year when the acquisition process is completed.
"India is certainly on for us but at the same time it is not a burning issue," Mr Goenka said.
When asked if the company could look at utilising the French firm's manufacturing resources for Mahindra Two Wheelers, Mr Goenka said: "Certainly, it is possible. There are two possibilities. First one is motorcycle brand Mojo, which we plan to launch in India in next six months and thereafter in international markets.
"Secondly, we will start producing electric scooter GenZe in the US next year. We are keen to take this product to Europe also."
On Mahindra's strategy to turnaround Peugeot Motocycles, Mr Goenka said: "We need to work on two levels. Firstly, we need to see how we can lower the material costs and secondly how to increase margins. At this moment I cannot say when we will be able to achieve break-even but I will be happy if it happens in 2-3 years.
"There is no magic wand. All such acquisitions take time to turnaround... We have plans."
The key focus areas would be to make the brand stronger in terms of scooters, developing products for mass markets, global expansion of the brand and synergies with Mahindra Two Wheelers, especially in product development.
There is no intention of outsourcing manufacturing to low cost countries, Mr Goenka said.
Peugeot Motocycles, which is also known as Peugeot Scooters, has registered losses for a decade now. It produces two-and three-wheeled scooters with 50cc to 400cc engines.
The company sold 79,000 scooters in 2013.
Mahindra Two-Wheelers, with sales of around 100 million euros, currently contributes a small portion to the overall turnover of Mahindra group which stands at over 12 billion euros.
Mr Goenka said it was imperative for Mahindra to sell around one million vehicles annually in the two-wheeler business to be a meaningful player in the segment.
"We sold just about 2 lakh units last year, so we need to sell five times more to be a meaningful player in the segment," he said.
When asked about the current automotive market conditions, Mr Goenka said: "We are witnessing a very fragmented recovery in the domestic market. It is not a uniform recovery as some segments as well as some companies are doing well while others are still struggling."
He said though certain segments like two-wheelers were doing well and commercial vehicles emerging out of the slowdown, there were still segments like light commercial vehicles which were de-growing.

Jaguar Land Rover UK Staff Reject Pay Deal
Reuters | Updated On: November 13, 2014 22:07 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
London: British workers at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover have voted against an offered pay rise and pension changes as Britain's biggest trade union said the firm should return to the negotiating table or face a ballot for industrial action.
Talks between the Indian Tata-owned automaker and workers' representatives ended with no agreement in October after the union rejected a pay deal offering staff a rise of at least 3 per cent in each of the next three years.
On Thursday, trade union Unite said nearly 13,000 staff had rejected the pay offer, with just under 500 accepting.
Unite national officer Roger Maddison said there were concerns over what he said were proposed reductions to pension provisions at the firm.
"With the company making a staggering 10 million pounds ($15.7 million) profit a day, it is no surprise that the workforce is angered by pension cuts and a pay offer that falls short in recognising their role in that success," he said.
Jaguar Land Rover would not comment on details of the pay or pension deal when asked by Reuters but a spokesman said the firm was very disappointed with the result of the ballot but committed to reaching a negotiated settlement.
After years in the doldrums, Jaguar Land Rover has enjoyed a new lease of life since it was bought by India's Tata group in 2008, recording a 2013/14 pre-tax profit of 2.5 billion pounds, more than doubling in three years.
Staff were offered a 3.6 per cent rise in the first year plus a bonus and either 3 percent or the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation plus 0.5 per cent depending on which is higher in years two and three, a trade union source told Reuters.
Last year the firm built almost one in three of Britain's 1.5 million cars and in October opened a 500 million pound engine manufacturing centre, its fifth site in Britain.

An execution in Florida and how often the U.S. uses capital punishmentBy Mark Berman November 13 Follow @markberman
Death row inmate Chadwick Banks. (Florida Department of Corrections via Reuters)
On Thursday evening, the Florida Department of Corrections is scheduled to execute Chadwick Banks. The execution comes two decades after Banks, who is now 43, was sentenced to death for killing his wife, Cassandra, before sexually assaulting his 10-year-old stepdaughter, Melody, and killing her as well. [UPDATE: Banks was executed at 7:27 p.m.]
Banks asked the state Supreme Court to stay the execution, a request that was  denied by the court  earlier this month. While Banks ate his final meal (fried fish, French fries, hush puppies and three types of dessert) on Thursday, his wife’s relatives spoke of the long wait for peace. Banks was sentenced not long before turning 23, so he has spent nearly half of his life on death row .
“I’ve waited 22 years,” Annette Black, Cassandra Banks’s mother, told the Talahassee Democrat . “I’ve never believed that my husband and I would live to see justice.”
The execution at the Florida State Prison in Starke, will be the eighth in Florida so far this year, tying the state with Missouri for the second-highest number in the country (trailing only Texas, which has executed 10 people). This would be the first time since 1994, the year Banks was sentenced, that Florida has executed that many people in a single calendar year.
This would also be the 32nd execution in the United States this year, which means the country won’t match a two-decade low. So far, the United States has executed 31 inmates in 2014, the same number of executions carried out in 1994. The country has exceeded that number every year since, a period marked by a surge in executions after 1994 and a gradual decline in recent years . The fewest number of executions since 1994 was the 37 inmates put to death in 2008.
The Banks execution was one of three originally scheduled to occur Thursday across the United States. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) signed an execution warrant for Miguel Padilla in September, but that was stayed by a district judge.
Oklahoma, meanwhile, had planned to put Charles Warner to death on Thursday. Warner was originally scheduled to die in April, the second of two executions scheduled for the same night. But after the first execution was botched – Clayton Lockett writhed and grimaced during the lethal injection , drawing considerable attention and criticism — so Warner’s execution was called off and then pushed back to November . A state investigation  found problems with the execution team as well as the state’s execution plans, and the state said it planned to change its protocols going forward.
Last month, Oklahoma asked a state court of appeals to delay three executions scheduled for this year — Warner’s execution, another in November and a third in December — because the state did not have the drugs or medical personnel needed. This comes at a time when states with lethal injection are having problems finding the drugs to use in these executions. Oklahoma had used a new lethal injection drug for the first time during Lockett’s execution, but the state’s review pointed to problems with the IV rather than the drugs. The Oklahoma court agreed and the executions were all pushed into next year , beginning with Warner’s new execution date on Jan. 15, nearly nine months after the botched Lockett execution that was scheduled to precede his.
[This post was updated to note that the execution was carried out.]

Man accused of shooting Pennsylvania state troopers charged with terrorismBy Mark Berman November 13 Follow @markberman

The man police say shot two Pennsylvania state troopers before eluding capture for nearly two months has been charged with terrorism, according to a criminal complaint  filed Thursday.
Police say that Eric Frein shot the troopers “with the purpose of influencing the policy of government,” which is why the two terrorism charges were added. The troopers who interviewed Frein after his capture wrote that he wanted to shoot police to make a change and “wake people up,” according to the affidavit.
Frein was captured on Oct. 30, seven weeks after he was first identified and charged with murder, assault and several other counts related to the Sept. 12 ambush.  Authorities said Frein shot and killed Cp. Bryon Dickson and seriously injured Alex Douglass at the Blooming Grove barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania, which sparked a massive search through a densely wooded area of the Pocono Mountains. Frein had been added to the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives list during the hunt, which ended quietly two weeks ago when Frein was found at an abandoned airplane hangar .
The criminal complaint filed Thursday also includes an affidavit from police that includes the text of a letter they say Frein wrote to his parents. In the letter, he apologized to them and said he was trying to “ignite a fire in the hearts of men.”
The letter was found on a thumb drive that police say they recovered from the airplane hanger where Frein was located. This drive was last accessed on Oct. 6, more than three weeks after the shooting at the Blooming Grove barracks.  You can read the complete complaint here .

Paring its early gains, the rupee finished lower by 4 paise at 61.55 against the US dollar on Thursday on renewed dollar demand from banks and importers.
Rupee
The rupee resumed higher at 61.46 per dollar as against last closing level of 61.51 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market.
However, it declined afterwards to 61.5950 on fag-end dollar demand from banks and importers before concluding at 61.55 per dollar, showing a loss of 4 paise or 0.07%.
The rupee hovered in a range of 61.46 and 61.5950 per dollar during the day.
In the global market, the dollar weakened against the euro after New York Federal Reserve president William C Dudley urged investors to be patient on the timing of a US interest-rate increase. The dollar index was down by 0.18% against its major global rivals.
Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex ended lower by 68.26 points or 0.24% to 27,940.64.
In the forward market, premium ended mixed on alternate bouts of receipts and payments transactions.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in April eased to 217-219 paise from 218-220 paise on Wednesday.
However, forward contracts maturing in October, 2015 gained to 442-444 paise from 434.5-436.5 paise previously.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for the US dollar at 61.5560 and for the euro at 76.6126.
The rupee strengthened against the pound to 97.04 from the previous closing level of 97.55 and recovered to 76.72 per euro from 76.74 per euro previously.
It also rebounded to 53.23 per 100 Japanese yen from Wednesday's level of 53.41.

BSE Sensex opened on a strong footing and continued its upward march to reclaim the key 28,000 mark to hit the day's high of 28,093.23 as buying picked up. (Reuters)

Stock markets today surged to new highs with benchmark Sensex rising over 106 points to close at 28,046.66 after WPI inflation cooling to a 5-year low in October strengthened hopes of a rate cut while good earnings from bluechips like SBI boosted the sentiment.
Besides, robust buying by overseas investors and tumbling crude oil prices supported the strong momentum in stocks.
The 50-scrip NSE Nifty index spurted by 32.05 points, or 0.38 per cent, to close at new high of 8,389.90, surpassing previous record closing of 8,383.30 hit on November 12.
The 30-share BSE Sensex opened on a strong footing and continued its upward march to reclaim the key 28,000 mark to hit the day’s high of 28,093.23 as buying picked up.
After some profit-booking at record levels, the barometer settled at 28,046.66 at a fresh record closing level, clocking net gain of 106.02 points or 0.38 per cent over last close.
Thus, the Sensex bettered its previous closing peak of 28,008.90 reached on November 12. Indices have been hitting new highs after the government announced a slew of reform measures to boost economy amid positive economic data.
Driven by softening prices of fuel and food items, the WPI inflation cooled to a five year low of 1.77 per cent in October raising hopes of rate cut by the Reserve Bank next month to boost economic growth.
State-run State Bank of India posted 30.5 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 3,100.41 crore for the quarter ended September 30, pushing its shares up by 2.55 per cent.
In metal pack, Hindalco surged 3.59 per cent.
“WPI for October is one of the lowest in recent years… focus would again shift to global markets, progress on reforms and RBI monetary policy,” said Sanjeev Zarbade, Vice President- Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Other gainers that lifted indices to new highs included CIL, GAIL, Bajaj Auto, HDFC Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Infosys, TCS, ICICI Bank and RIL. Overall, 21 of 30 Sensex stocks closed up.
A firming trend at the other Asian markets and a mixed opening in Europe too influenced sentiments, brokers said.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 690.61 crore yesterday.
Sectorwise, BSE Metal index rose the most by 2.53 per cent, followed by Realty 2.35 per cent, Oil&Gas 1.06 per cent, Banking 0.72 per cent and Auto 0.62 per cent among others. In line with bullish sentiment, midcap index and smallcap, both indices ended 0.52 per cent higher.

Bone marrow stem cell treatment has no added benefit over the conventional treatment in paralysis, also known as stroke, reveals a study conducted by AIIMS.
According to the study, people suffering from ischemic stroke should exercise caution while opting for stem cell therapy of any kind until more controlled studies come to the fore.
The study financed by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, was conducted over a period of six years between 2008 and 2014 and had sample size of 120 patients, all of whom had suffered from stroke.
Of the 120 patients, 60 patients were assigned to receive conventional treatment and the rest were assigned to bone marrow stem cells treatment besides the conventional treatment.
“While half of the patients underwent conventional treatment, the other half underwent stem cell aspiration from hip bone. Bone marrow cells were infused into the veins of their forearms,” the study stated.
On an average 28 crore bone marrow cells were injected of which blood forming stem cells were on average 29 lakhs per patient. Later, the patients faced difficulties in using arms and legs.
They were assessed at an interval of 3, 6 months and 12 months and the difficulties they experienced doing various activities of daily livings were measured using two scales which revealed that stem cell treatment is safe but there is no added benefits over the conventional treatment method.
“The study proved that stem cell treatment though safe, has no advantages over the conventional treatment process. Infact, any patient suffering from disabling and incurable diseases, should not go for stem cell treatment without knowing the scientific effects of it. The new paradigm of clinical practice which is called evidence based medicine requires evidence of clear benefit which outways any risk before a treatment is used in clinical practice,” said Kameshwar Prasad, Professor and Head, Department of Neurology & Director of Clinical Epidemiology Unit, AIIMS.
The study, which is the first and largest report on stem cells treatment for stroke has been published in the American Journal “Stroke”.
Apart from AIIMS, SGPGI Lucknow, PGIMER Chandigarh, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune and Army Research and Referral, New Delhi also participated in the study.

World Diabetes Day: Watch out for common early signsComments
Diabetes has a way of creeping up on you, with most people showing no symptoms at all. The few who do, almost never recognise them as red flags. The initial signs are usually so generalised that even doctors tend to miss them.
Almost half of India's population gets diagnosed when complications have set in, say experts, and advice everyone to get a simple blood sugar test by age 25. "Those who are obese, inactive and have a family history of diabetes should get it done each year starting at 18," says Dr Sujeet Jha, head, department of endocrinology at Max Super Speciality Saket, New Delhi.
Poorly-managed or untreated diabetes damages blood vessels and nerves and can lead to heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, pregnancy complications, amputations of limbs, and heart failure. Weak healing factor in patients leads to complications in diabetics who undergo surgery.
Among the common early signs of diabetes are:
Chronic fatigue: Diabetic patients cannot produce enough insulin absorb glucose from the blood. This starves the body of energy leaving them feeling fatigued and lethargic.
Tingling hands or feet: Prolonged exposure to high blood sugar damages nerve fibres throughout the body and interferes with their ability to transmit signals, causing tingling, numbness or burning pain in the hands or feet.
Bad breath, gum disease: Diabetes weakens the walls of the small blood vessels throughout the body, including in the gums, making them weak and prone to infection. Bacteria and fungi thrive in the mouth and infect the tongue, cheek and mouth, causing gum inflammation, dryness and bad breath.
Skin darkening, itchiness: Itchy or dry skin along with darkening and scaliness of the skin at the back of the neck, armpits and groin (acanthosis nigricans) may occur even in people who have insulin-resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes.
Blurry vision: High blood sugar changes the shape of the eye's lens, causing refractive problems such as blurry or distorted vision. It can also suddenly improve or deteriorate vision. Vision stabilises once the blood sugar levels is controlled.
Frequent urination: When blood sugar levels spike, the kidneys go on an overdrive to get rid of the excess sugar, forcing diabetics to pee often, sometimes several times during the night. This is followed by excessive thirst as the body tries to replenish fluids lost due to frequent toilet visits.
Bacterial and fungal infections: People with diabetes have low immunity and are more at risk of bacterial and fungal (candida) infections in the genitals and urinary-tract.

State Bank of India Q2 profit up 30.5 pct; lags estimatesICICI Bank to sell its Russian subsidiary
State Bank of India (SBI) , the nation’s top lender by assets, reported a 30.5 percent increase in quarterly profit, but lagged estimates as provisions for bad loans increased.
SBI, which accounts for about a quarter of loans and deposits in India, said standalone net profit rose to 31 billion rupees ($502.92 million) during its fiscal second quarter ended September 30, from 23.75 billion rupees in the year-ago period.
Analysts on average had expected the bank to report a net profit of 32.54 billion rupees, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.

Pune schoolgirl s Google doodle on Assamalbert einstein
(A doodle by a Pune schoolgirl…)
NEW DELHI: A doodle by a Pune schoolgirl artfully depicting the natural and cultural richness of Assam has been featured today on the Google India homepage on the occasion of Children's Day.
Vaidehi Reddy , a class IX student of Army Public School, was adjudged the winner of this year's India Doodle4Google (D4G) contest in which there were more than a million entries from over 2,100 schools across 50 cities.
The winning doodle titled "Natural and Cultural Paradise - Assam" in which Reddy depicted the state's famed wildlife by sketching the one-horned rhinoceros, the tiger, tea bushes and bamboo trees. A woman performing the Bihu dance carrying a 'japi' (traditional hat) is also there in the doodle.
"I want to go to Assam because it is rich in both, natural beauty and culture. Its music and rich folk arts are also very good," Reddy said in her caption in the contest which asked the participants to draw their own doodle about "A place in India I wish to visit".
Her entry was selected by a jury comprising political cartoonist Ajit Ninan, Art Director Children's Publishing at ACK Media Savio Mascarenhas and Google Doodle team lead Ryan Germick .
The doodles were judged on three criteria - artistic merit, creativity and theme communication.
Doodles are the spontaneous changes that are made to the Google logo in celebration of holidays, anniversaries and the lives of famous artists, pioneers and scientists who have helped shape history.
Since 1998 there have been over 2,000 doodles on Google homepages around the world. Themes based on India have featured on the Google page umpteen number of times and more recently on occasions like R K Narayan's 108th birthday (October 10) and the Lok Sabha elections counting day (May 16). Independence Day and Republic Day are featured every year.
On August 4, Google paid a tribute to legendary singer-actor Kishore Kumar on his 85th birth anniversary by dedicating a special doodle to him.
The doodle showed the late music icon's sketch replacing the L of 'GOOGLE' and borders with drawings of masks, pen and paper, camera and symbol of music, depicting his versatility as an artiste.
In 1998, Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin placed a stick figure drawing behind the second 'o' in the word Google as a message to users that they were "out of the office" attending a music and art festival.
From there the idea of decorating the logo to mark cultural moments was born. Users really enjoyed this quirky change to the clean Google homepage. As a result a turkey was added on Thanksgiving in 1998, two pumpkins for the 'o's appeared for Halloween in October of 1999 as well as a few others.
After two years of playing around with the logo on special occasions, Larry and Sergey asked webmaster Dennis Hwang to create a doodle for Bastille Day in France. Soon after he was appointed the chief doodler and doodles became more frequent occurrences on the homepage.
Users started seeing doodles for more holidays and starting in 2003 doodles for people's birthdays. The first being Monet in 2001, Picasso in 2002 and then Michelangelo and Albert Einstein six months later. Since then the amount of doodles and the variety of subjects have grown to celebrate a much wider array of events, holidays, anniversaries and birthdays of some of history's greats.

"I congratulate her for depicting Assam so beautifully in her doodle design. She has showcased the state on an international platform. Her unbound love and affection towards Assam is commendable and praiseworthy," he said.

The Bombay high court on Friday stayed the implementation of the state government’s decision to provide 16% quota in government jobs and educational institutes for the Maratha community.
The division bench of chief justice Mohit Shah and justice MS Sonak also stayed the 5% reservation for 50 Muslim communities in public employment, but allowed them to avail of the quota in educational institutes run and aided by the government.
The state government, however, has decided to challenge this decision in the Supreme Court, with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis saying he will take all possible steps to remove the stay on the Maratha reservation. While he did not comment on reservation for Muslims, the BJP has been opposed to it.
While hearing a bunch of public interest litigations, challenging the June 25 decision of the previous Congress-NCP cabinet, the bench concluded it was not up to the state to treat the Maratha community as a ‘backward class’.
“Rather, the National Commission for Backward Classes and the Mandal Commission has concluded the Marathas are a socially-advanced and prestigious community,” the court said, citing the findings of the Mandal Commission (1990), the National Commission for Backward Classes in February 2000 and a July 2008 report of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (Bapat Commission).
The bench noted several flaws in the report of the Narayan Rane Committee that had recommended the inclusion of the Maratha community in the socially- and economically-backward class, and which forms the basis of the 16 % reservation in favour of the community. The bench observed that the Rane committee did not refer to important rulings of the Supreme Court and findings of other commissions.
Further, constitutional benches of the Apex Court have laid down a law that the percentage of reservation for public employment cannot exceed 50%, the bench said, adding that the state did not have the power to breach that ceiling limit.
However, while refusing to stay the 5% reservation in education for backward Muslims, the bench said the material the state had relied on, to determine the backwardness of these 50 communities, makes a case for the existence of an extraordinary situation. “The material suggests the dire necessity to draw youth belonging to these communities to secular education,” the bench observed. “The material refers to an abysmally-low level of educational achievement, which ails the community, and a high dropout rate.”
Fadnavis has called for a meeting of group leaders of all political parties on Saturday morning. “The state is fully supportive of the Maratha reservation. We will appeal in SC. We will take measures to ensure that the quota remains. We will amend the existing law,” the CM told mediapersons.
Congress leader and former-CM Prithviraj Chavan, under whose leadership the quota was passed early this year, said his party would cooperate with the government to represent its case in the Apex Court. “The Congress will study the interim ruling and discuss it with legal experts. We will also check if the Congress can be a party to the petition,” he said.
 
‘NOT A BACKWARD COMMUNITY’
Commenting on the status of Marathas, the court observed, “Early historical and social documentation suggests that although Marathas originated from the Kunbi (farmers) caste, from the 14th century onwards, they evolved into a separate community with high social, educational and political status.”

WTO: Pact with US to improve India s positio...(WTO rules say that subsidizing…)
By Neha Thirani Bagri
MUMBAI: India and the United States reached an agreement Thursday over food stockpiles, removing a major obstacle to a global trade deal that has been stalled for months.
The pact, which precedes a meeting this weekend of the Group of 20 major economies, allows India to continue its extensive food subsidy program. In settling the dispute, India returns to the negotiating table on a broader trade package .
That package, first agreed upon at a World Trade Organization meeting in December in Bali, Indonesia, is the first significant global trade deal since the creation of the WTO nearly two decades ago. Aimed at facilitating the movement of goods across international borders, the agreement focuses on easing customs procedures, reducing red tape and upgrading border infrastructure.
Proponents of the deal argue that it would add $1 trillion to the global economy and create 21 million jobs. Critics, though, have noted that it would require a substantial investment from developing countries to upgrade their ports and borders.
But talks on the trade package reached an impasse in July when India said it would veto the global trade deal unless a dispute over its food security program was resolved. Since then, India has faced resistance from other member countries for stalling a critical agreement.
Michael B. Froman, the U.S. trade representative, said that President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India had discussed the issue during Modi's visit to Washington in September in light of the "mounting crisis of confidence" facing the WTO after the trade deal was derailed.
"In recent days, officials of both governments worked intensively and reached an agreement that should give new momentum to multilateral efforts at the WTO," Froman said in a statement.
India views the stockpiling as core to its food security and its efforts to feed millions of its impoverished citizens.
The Indian government buys food, including grain, from its farmers and stockpiles it for a public distribution system, where it is sold at government-run stores at subsidized prices. The food subsidy program, which has often been criticized as ineffective, is available to 75 per cent of India's rural population and 50 per cent of the urban population, according the National Food Security Act introduced last year.
WTO rules say that subsidizing more than 10 per cent of the grain produced for food in a country distorts the market for trade. But India wants to do away with that cap. Countries including the United States and Pakistan have expressed fears that India was accumulating too much grain and that it might eventually release the surplus on the world market, lowering prices for other producers.
In Bali, WTO members had agreed to a temporary solution in which developing countries would not be penalized for breaching their subsidy levels until a permanent solution was found by 2017. Indian officials, though, were concerned that the issue had been sidelined and wanted talks on the issue to progress.
India and the United States have now agreed on a "peace clause," which protects member countries from being legally challenged under WTO agreements until a permanent solution is found on the stockpiling issue. The clause will keep India safe from accusations that it subsidizes too much grain beyond 2017. A timeline for negotiations on stockpiling was also set, giving India the assurance that the issue will be dealt with promptly.
"India and the United States have resolved their differences on public stockholding of food," Nirmala Sitharaman, India's commerce minister, said Thursday at a news conference in New Delhi. The move, she said, paves the way for India to ratify the global trade deal.
"This breakthrough represents a significant step in efforts to get the Bali package and the multilateral trading system back on track," Roberto Azevedo, the director general of the WTO, said in a statement. "It will now be important to consult with all WTO members so that we can collectively resolve the current impasse as quickly as possible. Implementation of all aspects of the Bali package would be a major boost to the WTO, enhancing our ability to deliver beneficial outcomes to all our members."
Analysts said the agreement with the United States would improve India's negotiating position at the G-20 meeting and in other global talks.
"It is a move ahead both for multilateralism at the WTO and for India, which was being viewed as obstructionist," said Rajrishi Singhal, a senior geoeconomics fellow at Gateway House, a foreign policy research group in Mumbai.

CCI to decide on Sun-Ranbaxy deal by month-...Ashok Chawla
(This big ticket deal in the…)
MUMBAI: Competition Commission is likely to take the final decision in the $4 billion Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy deal by the end of this month, fair trade watchdog's chairman Ashok Chawla has said.
This big ticket deal in the pharma space is also the first M&A transaction to have gone through public scrutiny amid concerns of adverse impact on fair competition in the market.
"We had asked them (the two companies) to come up with some remedial measures which they have submitted and we are studying the same.
"A final decision on the deal will be taken by the end of this month," Chawla said today.
He was speaking to reporters after delivering the keynote address at an event organised here by the Public Affairs Forum of India along with law firm J Sagar Associates .
The Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy transaction, which would create the country's largest pharmaceutical company, had come under close scrutiny of CCI after it was found prima-facie that the "combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition."
The combined entity would have operations in 65 countries, 47 manufacturing facilities across 5 continents, and a significant platform of speciality and generic products marketed globally. The deal, announced in April this year, is also the first one where the Commission sought public comments.
The public scrutiny of the deal, which would create the fifth largest speciality generics company in the world, ended on September 24. Major issues being examined by CCI on the deal are with respect to the molecules market.
The public consultation process was launched in order to determine whether the combination has or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India.
"The Commission formed a prima facie opinion that the combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition and accordingly directed Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy (parties) to publish details of the combination within ten working days for bringing the combination to the knowledge or information of the public and persons affected or likely to be affected by such combination," it had said.
Prior to that, CCI had asked the two pharma majors to make public specific details of their proposed merger.

NEW DELHI: New Delhi has high average density of built up area, nearly twice the levels of wider New York metro area despite the Indian capital's relatively low-rise urban landscape, a research report prepared by London School of Economics has said.
"Comparing Delhi's urban dynamics to the eight other Urban Age cities - London, Bogota, Lagos, Tokyo, New York, Istanbul and Berlin- highlights that despite the capital's relatively low-rise urban landscape, it has an extremely high average density of built up area of 19,698 people per square kilometre.
"This is nearly twice the levels for wider New York metro area (which at 11,531 people/sq km includes high-rise Manhattan), the research report which was released today said.
The report also said Delhi scores well in having a very low level of violent crime measured by the murder rate (homicides per 100,000 people), than New York and Istanbul.
The research has been carried out in preparation of the two-day conference on Urban Age 'Governing Urban Futures' which started here today.
The conference is being organised by 'LSE Cities' at the London School of Economics and Political Science and Deutsche Bank's Alfred Herrhausen Society in partnership with the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).
Speaking on the occasion, Deutsche Bank AG Co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain said,"Today, cities account for 2 per cent of the world's landmass but produce 80 per of global wealth. Over the next 30 years, one third of the world's economic growth will be generated in the top 100 cities."
Quoting the McKinsey Global Institute report, Jain said, "India needs to build the equivalent of a new Chicago every year for the next few decades to sustain its growth."
"That's why the Indian government's '100 Smart Cities' initiative is so important," he added.

RBI may face pressure for rate cut as inflation easesEasing inflation makes case for RBI rate cut in December
Rajesh Kumar Singh     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 14, 2014  | 16:31 IST

The country's inflation dropped to a new multi-year low in October, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices, intensifying pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates to encourage spending and investment needed to boost growth.
The wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation rose an annual 1.77 per cent in October, its lowest level since September 2009, compared with the 2.20 per cent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
WPI inflation data comes days after the government reported that retail (or CPI-based) inflation had dropped to 5.52 per cent in October, below the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 6 per cent target for January 2016.
"With inflation at or under 6 per cent we think RBI is likely to face pressure to ease, not just from the government, but also from RBI's own policy committee," said Devika Mehndiratta, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Singapore.
The economist expects retail inflation to hit a low of close to 4 per cent in November, opening up an opportunity for an interest rate cut of 25 basis points in the second quarter of 2015.
Businesses and corporates in the country have been pleading for a cut in interest rates to stimulate consumption in the economy, which is mostly domestic demand-driven.
Consumer goods output - a proxy for consumer demand that drives 60 per cent of the domestic economy - has grown in just two of the last 21 months. It fell an annual 4.0 per cent in September.
The central bank is meeting on December 2 for its next monetary policy review, having kept the key repo rate steady at 8.0 per cent since January.
A Reuters poll in October had shown that economists expected rates to be held unchanged until well into 2015, due to worries that price pressures would revive once a favourable base effect fades out and food prices rise after poor rains in the summer.
Bond traders are betting on one of the biggest interest rate reductions among major emerging markets once the rate cutting cycle begins.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield had dropped 36 basis points since October 1 until the last session on hopes of a rate cut.

Sukhoi-30s to be back in air in weeks time: Air ForceChiefPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 3:48 pm
India’s frontline combat aircraft Sukhoi-30 fleet, which was grounded after a crash near Pune, will be back in air ‘within a week’s time’, Air Force Chief Arup Raha on Friday said.
He also said that the findings of a Court of Inquiry into the crash are being finalised.
This is the longest period that the Russian-made aircraft has been grounded since 2009 when its operation was suspended for nearly three weeks following an accident.
“This (Pune crash on October 14) was an accident which appeared to be automatic firing of the seats. Court of Inquiry is about to be complete and the findings are being finalised. We will have the results very soon and we are going to start flying the aircraft very soon,” Raha said.
He said that “preliminary findings” do indicate that they have been able to find the reason and “we will be able to tackle the problem without much issue”.
“I am very hopeful that the CoI will end soon and we will be able to fly this fleet all over again and get back to normal,” he said.
Asked specifically how long will it take for the Sukhoi flights to resume, he said, “Within a week’s time we will start flying this aircraft.”
Talking about the issues related to after sales support by Russians, the Air Force Chief said SU-30 is a “huge and complicated project” under which 270 plus aircraft are being acquired from Russia.
“Of course IAF has been involved in final configuration of the aircraft. A lot of it is from our side, indigenous and from other sources. So this is a huge project, a complicated project,” the Chief of Air Staff said.
Raha said the aircraft has good operation capabilities but there are spare supply issues that are being tackled.
“Any equipment that you buy, whether it is your own indigenous or from outside, it has its own problems and issues. Whatever you mentioned is being tackled,” he said, replying to questions about lack of proper post-sales support from Russians and huge delay in setting up of repair and overhaul facilities here.
Raha said the Air Force has been interacting with officials from Russia and HAL, which is also involved in the licensed production of aircraft and maintenance activities.
“All these are complicated procedures. It involves not only technology but also fiances. But these are being resolved. I will not say everything is in order but things are being worked out which happens in any product. There is distinct improvement, he said.
A team of 10 experts from Russia is currently in Pune, the Sukhoi-30 base, probing the crash that took place on October 14 near there with both the pilot seats ejecting without any command during landing.
The pilots were safe but the aircraft crashed about 20 kms short of the runway.
As standard operating procedure, the flying of the aircraft was suspended and a CoI ordered.
The sources said the Russian experts have claimed that the ejection of seats cannot take place automatically, a contention that is not being accepted by the Indian Air Force.

Russia to G-20: We re here  so are our warships | WTO deal: Obama hails ModiAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(In recent days, four Russian…)
BRISBANE: Vladimir Putin is underlining his presence at a major summit of world leaders in Australia by stationing warships in waters off the country's northeastern coast, prompting the Australian prime minister to angrily accuse Russia of trying to reclaim the "lost glories" of the Soviet Union .
The diplomatic drama, which has been simmering since a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over an area of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists in July, threatened to overshadow Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's goal of keeping this weekend's G-20 summit focused on economic growth.
But Abbott, who had previously said he would physically confront the Russian president over the Flight 17 disaster that killed 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents, did little to dampen tensions with his latest critique of Putin's Russia.
In recent days, four Russian warships have entered international waters off the northeast Australian coast to coincide with Putin's visit to Australia for the summit that brings together the leaders of the world's 20 biggest industrialized and developing economies. Australia, in turn, sent three warships of its own to monitor them.
The Russian embassy said today that Russia's Pacific fleet was testing its range, and could be used as security for Putin.
Abbott was not impressed. "Russia is being much more assertive now than it has been for a very long time," he said at a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron , also in Australia for the summit. "Interestingly, Russia's economy is declining even as Russia's assertiveness is increasing."
The prime minister, who met with Putin earlier this week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Beijing , aired details of his conversation with the Russian leader.
"One of the points that I tried to make to President Putin is that Russia would be so much more attractive if it was aspiring to be a superpower for peace and freedom and prosperity ... instead of trying to recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the old Soviet Union."
Abbott, an athletic 56-year-old former amateur boxer whose government is a staunch US ally, has gained a higher international profile by loudly demanding more cooperation from Russia on the Dutch-led investigation into the downing of Flight 17.
He raised eyebrows last month when he declared he intended to "shirtfront" Putin, using an Australian football term for a head-on shoulder charge to an opponent's chest.

Sensex, Nifty Trade Flat; Infosys Falls 4%
BSE Sensex and Nifty gained momentum in late trade today to end at record closing highs. The Sensex ended 106 points higher at 28,046 while Nifty rose 32 points to 8,389 as foreign investors continued to pile into domestically oriented blue-chips.
Broad buying was seen in all sectors expect in defensives like healthcare and FMCG sector.
Market analyst Sarvendra Srivastava says Nifty remains in the 8200-8400 range and until 8180 levels are held on, the momentum is in favour of bulls. If Nifty breaks out above 8,400 levels decisively, the index could see further 400-500 point gains, he added.
Rate sensitive stocks rose today after data showed that wholesale inflation slowed to a five-year low of 1.77 per cent in October. Today's inflation data comes days after the consumer price inflation dropped to 5.52 per cent in October, below the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 6 per cent target for January 2016. This has raised expectations of an earlier-than-expected rate cut from the RBI.
Among banking stocks SBI rose 2.5 per cent, Bank of Baroda 1.5 per cent while HDFC Bank gained 1.5 per cent. SBI reported its quarterly earnings. Though its net profit slightly missed estimates, better-than-expected asset quality in Q2 helped, say traders.
Metal stocks saw some buying after their recent underperformance. JSPL and Hindalco rose 3-4 per cent.
Overseas investors bought shares worth Rs 690 crore on Thursday. Foreign portfolio investors have invested $15.12 billion in Indian stocks and $23.15 billion in debt markets so far in 2014, according to regulatory data. (With Agency Inputs)

By Myles Udland
Alibaba will be issuing debt.
In filings with the SEC on Thursday, the Chinese e-commerce giant disclosed plans to issue senior debt to US investors in order to refinance its existing credit facilities.
A report from Bloomberg's Sridhar Natarajan and Zijing Wu, citing two people familiar with the deal, Alibaba is planning to raise up to $8 billion in the offering.
Ratings agencies Fitch and S&P both assigned 'A+' ratings to Alibaba's corporate credit rating. S&P cited the company's "dominant market position in e-commerce in China and the company's minimal financial leverage."
Fitch also described Alibaba's market position as "dominant" and said, "The large size and potential for sustainable growth in China's online shopping market help mitigate Alibaba's limited geographical diversification."
This planned offering comes about two months after the company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in the largest IPO in NYSE history.
Natarajan and Wu reported that Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and JPMorgan will manage the offering.
Singles Day in China was earlier this week, which is similar to the Black Friday or Cyber Monday shopping holidays in the US, and Alibaba announced that it pulled in a record $9.3 billion in sales, a record for the company. Last year, Alibaba's Singles Day sales totaled $5.8 billion.
Earlier on Thursday, Alibaba shares were trading at a record high, just below $120, but in afternoon trade were down about 2% to $115.75.

The Russian-made combat aircraft fleet was grounded after a crash near Pune on October 14.
The Indian Air Force’s frontline fighter jet, Sukhoi-30, has been cleared for flying after being grounded for nearly a month.
The entire fleet of about 200 Su-30s had been grounded following a Sukhoi crash in Pune on October 14. “The Sukhoi-30 fleet has been cleared for flying,” IAF spokesperson Wing Commander S.S. Birdi said on Friday.
Pune crash
On the reasons behind the Pune crash, IAF Chief Arup Raha told reporters, “This accident appeared to be due to automatic firing of the seats. The Court of Inquiry is about to be completed and the findings are being finalised.”
A team of 10 Russian experts joined the Indian experts in probing the cause of the crash in which the fighter jet crash landed on its belly around 20 km from the runway, while the pilots ejected safely.
Third instance
This was the third and also the longest period the Sukhoi fleet was grounded since its first crash in 2009.
Su-30s are the most modern of the IAF’s fighter jets and represent almost a third of its fighter fleet.

ASCI ties up with Dept of Consumer Affairs to stop misleading ads
Special Correspondent
advertising
In a move to promote and strengthen self-regulation in advertising and step up efforts to prevent misleading advertisements, Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has officially tied up with Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA), of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution.
ASCI is a self-regulatory organization of advertising content.
The collaboration will evaluate and pass strictures against violators and has identified six priority sectors to be covered including Agriculture & food, Health, Education, Housing, Financial Services and E-commerce.
A statement from ASCI said that while operational aspects of the collaboration are being worked upon, DoCA has requested ASCI to flag advertisements that are in clear violation of the law (eg. Claims regarding cure of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, leucoderma, etc. covered under the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act. "This will enable prompt action against such non-scrupulous advertisers and protect consumer interest," ASCI said.
"The problem of misleading advertisements and the consequent unfair trade practices that arise is widespread – across sectors, mediums and geographies," G. Gurucharan, Additional Secretary, DoCA said in a statement. "DoCA’s effort is to build a coalition of stakeholders to combat this menace – partnering with ASCI is an important step."
Complaints will be evaluated across media like print, packaging, internet, outdoor, wall paintings, posters, billboards etc and DoCA will redirect complaints received by it to ASCI to avoid duplication of processing of complaints against advertisements that is already under process by ASCI.
"Earlier our work has been recognized by various government bodies like Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Medical Council of India, etc.," Narendra Ambwani, Chairman, ASCI said. "It is highly motivating to see such developments and this partnership has widened ASCI’s scope for complaints."

ICICI Bank raises over $95 mn via Chinese debt mktICICI Bank raises over $95 mn via Chinese debt market
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 22:00 IST
Private sector lender ICICI Bank on Thursday raised 600 million yuans from the Chinese debt market (Dim Sum bonds) or a little over $95 million, at a coupon of 4 per cent, merchant banking sources said in Mumbai.
This is the fourth time that the Mumbai-based lender has tapped the Dim sum bond market and has so far raised 2,050 million yuans.
According to merchant bankers, the three-year money has been raised by ICICI's Bahrain branch and will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The issue is part of the bank's $7.5 billion medium term note programme.
Dim sum bonds are denominated in the Chinese currency and are issued in the Hong Kong market, and therefore resident Chinese investors cannot subscribe to these instruments.
When contacted, an ICICI bank spokesman refused to comment. It can be noted that the Chanda Kochhar-led bank first tapped the Chinese debt market in 2012 and raised 1,000 million yuans in two tranches.
The bank again went to this market last year and raised 650 million yuans. The current issuance was arranged by StanChart and Mitsubishi UFG.
Meanwhile, the international rating agency Moody's in a note from Singapore, said it has assigned Baa2 to these senior unsecured notes.
Assigning the Baa2 rating Moody's said the rating is anchored on the bank's Baa3 baseline credit assessment and the high likelihood of systemic support in the event of a crisis. It further said the Baa2 rating is at the same level as the foreign currency debt ceiling for India. The bank's foreign currency deposit ratings of Baa3/P-3 are constrained by the sovereign ceiling.

Eighty US troops return from Ebola mission  face isolationEighty US troops sent to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Liberia returned to the United States on Thursday.

Eighty US troops sent to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Liberia returned to the United States on Thursday and began a 21-day period of monitored isolation, the Pentagon said.
None of the troops showed symptoms of the deadly disease, a Pentagon statement said.
The men and women landed at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia and were taken to a specially prepared monitoring area, where they will be screened twice a day.
Access to the area is restricted to medical and support personnel, but the troops will be able to contact family and friends by telephone and through social media.
The United States has more than 2,000 troops in Liberia as part of the US Ebola response mission. They were assigned to build up to 17 Ebola treatment units and provide mobile testing labs.

Islamic State jihadists to mint own gold  silver and copper coinsThe Islamic State jihadist group announced today it will start minting its own gold, silver and copper coins.
By: Agence-France Presse | Beirut | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:06 am
The Islamic State jihadist group announced today it will start minting its own gold, silver and copper coins for use in areas under IS control in Syria and Iraq.
“God willing, coins of several types will be minted from gold, silver and copper,” the IS said in a statement distributed on jihadist forums.
The aim was to replace “the tyrannical currency system that was imposed on the Muslims, and which led to their oppression”.
The IS said its circulation of the new coins, to counter the widely-used US dollar, would free Muslims “from profiteering, satanical economic oppression”, and it posted pictures of what the coins would look like.
On one side, the words “Islamic State” and “a caliphate following the model of the Prophet (Mohammed)” are engraved, as well as the weight and value of the coin.
On the other, various symbols are used.
The five-dinar gold coin shows a world map, while the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem is portrayed on the silver 10-dirham coin.
The crescent is embossed on one of the copper coins, while three palm trees are engraved on another.
Unlike the modern form of the dinar used today in some Muslim countries, the ancient dinars were made of pure gold and silver rather than less precious metals.
Experts say the IS is financed mainly through extortion of local populations in areas it controls, crude oil sales and ransoms for kidnappings.
It is unclear how much precious metals the group has amassed.

After the victory: Move to DBT  incomes policy instead of MSPFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
At the outset, since this newspaper was one of those that accused the government of brinkmanship at the WTO, an apology: instead of derailing the WTO talks, playing hardball helped with the US coming around to India’s point of view. The victory is important since, apart from increasing India’s stature in the world, it shows most global players will play ball as long as they feel there are business opportunities to be grabbed; just the single act of clearing Rs 100,000 crore of defence projects demonstrated the opportunities for global investors with a new government in place. Indeed, that is the reason why, despite defence-FDI being limited to just 49%, there is a lot more foreign interest in the sector.
That said, there were several reasons for FE’s position despite the fact that, even on the face of things, the WTO rules were arbitrary and biased – despite huge inflation in agriculture prices over the past few decades, the reference price for calculating subsidies remained at 1986-88 levels. First, FE argued that India could, as other countries had, take into account foodgrains inflation and, once this was done, still find its agriculture support to be within the WTO limits. Indeed, when the government did notify its agriculture subsidies to the WTO, it put the bulk of subsidies under what the WTO recognises as non-trade-distortionary boxes since they were given to ‘low-income or resource poor producers’, suggesting the brouhaha was uncalled for. Two, while the MSP-based policy was at the heart of the WTO controversy, FE argued this was also against India’s interests – to that extent, complying with WTO norms would help India push its own agriculture reforms. If, for instance, direct cash transfers were given to the poor, this would cost just around Rs 45,000 a year as compared to around three times that using the FCI system; high MSPs also ensured FCI had too much foodgrains, a large part of which cannot even be stored. Indeed, the money saved from using MSPs could be used to give farmers an income regardless of the crops they grew. Not only would this incomes policy be WTO-compatible – that’s why US/EU farm support does not attract WTO sanctions – this would take away the excessive focus on wheat and rice and ensure farmers diversified to crops like fruits and vegetables in most states, and to wheat and rice in water-rich states like Bihar and West Bengal which are more suited for this but don’t get enough farm support.
To be fair, the government has already moved on some of these issues. The bonuses over the MSP given by BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have been tackled with the government saying it would limit procurement in these states – Chhattisgarh has already announced it will be limiting purchases. A committee has been set up on restructuring FCI, though it is unclear how restructuring FCI will help unless there is a fundamental rethink in India’s farm policy which also means ending the unlimited procurement system in states like Punjab and Haryana.

Madhya Pradesh: Two vice-presidents quit posts over ticket distributionUjjain Premchand Guddu and Manak Agrawal
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:16 pm | Updated: November 15, 2014 2:13 am
Two more vice presidents of the Congress party resigned from their posts on Friday in protest against high handedness in distribution of tickets in the ensuing elections to municipal bodies in Madhya Pradesh.
The resignations of former Lok Sabha MP from Ujjain Premchand Guddu and senior leader from Bhind Govind Singh follow the resignation of another vice-president Manak Agrawal, who was unhappy with a section of leadership for the way tickets were distributed in Hoshangaba and Itarsi.
Guddu accused the party of fielding a candidate affiliated with the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in Ujjain while Singh alleged that the relative of a murder accused was fielded in Bhind.
An office-bearer of the Congress said local leaders could not reconcile themselves to the high command’s decision to field new candidates in the local body elections. The regional satraps are unhappy because they think they have not been given due importance as was the norm before.
Cabinet Minister and senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra compared the Congress with a sinking ship and the deserting leaders with rats. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for Congress-mukt Bharat will take effect in Madhya Pradesh,” he said.

Gold prices fall on low demand amid weak global cuesGold prices fall on low demand amid weak global cues

Gold prices moved down by 0.24 per cent to Rs 25,760 per 10 grams in futures trade on Friday as participants engaged in offloading of positions amid a weak global trend as physical demand for the precious metal declined.
Market analysts said a weak trend overseas as strengthening dollar eroded demand for a safe haven, mainly put pressure on prices of the yellow metal in futures trade in the domestic bullion market .
At the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold for delivery in December shed Rs 62 (or 0.24 per cent) to Rs 25,760 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 445 lots.
Similarly, the metal for delivery in February 2015 fell by Rs 49 (or 0.19 per cent) to Rs 25,951 per 10 grams in 29 lots.
Gold in Singapore, which usually sets the trend on the domestic front, fell as much as 0.40 per cent to US $1,157.94 an ounce.
Meanwhile, spot gold prices declined by Rs 90 to Rs 26,360 per 10 grams in the national capital in Thursday's trade.

Berkshire Hathaway buys P&G s Duracell for US $4.7 bn sharesJonathan Stempel and Devika Krishna Kumar     New York/Bangalore   Last Updated: November 14, 2014  | 17:20 IST

Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble 's Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company's tax bill.
Rather than pay cash, Berkshire will give P&G US $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. P&G will infuse US $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.
The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive AG Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.
Buffett , meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Nebraska-based conglomerate Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week.
Buying Duracell is a "brilliant move," said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short.
"Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill," Kass added. "And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction."
Berkshire has said it paid just US $336 million for its 1.9 per cent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30.
Assuming a 35 per cent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than US $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier in 2014.
Berkshire's income tax bill was US $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 per cent of pre-tax earnings.
NOT A GOOD SIGN
Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup.
"I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette," Buffett said in a statement.
Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not.
While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources.
"It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands," Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. "I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G."
Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.
"WILLING AND EAGER"
Berkshire has owned P&G stock since P&G bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989.
Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette's board when the company agreed to buy Duracell for US $7 billion in stock in 1996. That's more than twice of what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion.
Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock.
Earlier in 2014, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66 for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings, which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets.
Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses: Berkshire had US $62.38 billion in cash as of September 30.
P&G will take a non-cash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust results for the 2014 financial year to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation.
Shares of Energizer Holdings, Duracell's main rival, rose as much as 4.7 per cent to a record high before easing to US $128.43, up 2.6 per cent.
UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved "willing and eager" to buy Duracell.
Goldman Sachs, Jones Day, and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft advised P&G.

The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex surged to a new high, rising over 106 points to close at 28,046.66 after easing wholesale (or WPI) inflation, which cooled to a 5-year low in October, strengthened hopes of a rate cut while good earnings from bluechips like SBI boosted the sentiment.
Besides, robust buying by overseas investors and tumbling crude oil prices supported the strong momentum in stocks.
The 30-issue BSE barometer  opened on a strong footing and continued its upward march to reclaim the key 28,000-mark and hit the day's high of 28,093.23 as buying picked up.
Brokers said, a firming trend at the other Asian markets and a mixed opening in Europe too influenced trading sentiments.
The broader 50-share National Stock Exchange (NSE) index Nifty spurted by 32.05 points (or 0.38 per cent) to close at new high of 8,389.90, surpassing itd previous closing peak of 8,383.30 hit on November 12.
After some profit-booking at record levels, the gauge settled at 28,046.66 to log a fresh record closing level, clocking a net gain of 106.02 points (or 0.38 per cent) over its previous close on Thursday .
Stock market indices have been hitting new highs after the government announced a slew of reform measures to boost the economy amid positive economic data.
Driven by softening prices of fuel and food items, the WPI inflation cooled to a five-year low of 1.77 per cent in October raising hopes of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India in December to boost economic growth .
"WPI for October is one of the lowest in recent years... Focus would again shift to global markets, progress on reforms and RBI monetary policy ," said Sanjeev Zarbade, Vice President- Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Public sector lender State Bank of India (SBI) reported a 30.5 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 3,100.41 crore for the September-quarter, pushing its shares up by 2.55 per cent .

Under attack DERC withdraws power tariff hike in Delhi within 24hrsPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 4:26 pm
Facing severe attack from political parties, Delhi’s power regulator DERC today withdrew the power tariff hike of up to seven per cent which was announced last night.
The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission said the hike was rolled back “realising” that a number of power generation companies including NTPC, which supply electricity to the city, provided only part information about price of fuel such as coal and gas.
The DERC last night had announced re-introduction of the power purchase adjustment cost (PPAC) surcharge to effect an increase of tariff by up to seven per cent from Saturday.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had slammed DERC for raising the tariff, demanding an immediate roll back, but DERC today claimed that the decision to withdraw the hike was not due to criticism from the parties.
DERC chairperson P D Sudhakar said additional information on cost of producing of power from coal and gas-based power generating stations has been sought and a fresh decision on tariff will be taken within two weeks after examining the details.
“It has now been brought to the notice of the Commission that various generators including NTPC supplying power to Delhi have provided only part of the information regarding pricing of fuel and billing of power generated at their stations.
“Additional information has been called for, which is expected shortly which will have a direct bearing on the PPAC claims (by the discoms),” Sudhakar said.
Asked why the additional information on pricing of fuel and cost of power production was not sought earlier, he said the DERC had increased the tariff provisionally and now it felt that the detail costing of the generating stations should have been analysed before hiking the rates.
“We will take a decision on PPAC within next two weeks,” said Sudhakar while claiming that decision was not revoked due to criticism from political parties.
Last night, the DERC had hiked the tariff by 7 per cent for consumers of BSES Yamuna Power and was fixed at 4.5 per cent for BSES Rajdhani.
The hike for consumers of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd was 2.5 per cent.
Asked about the issue, Lt Governor Najeeb Jung only said the hike has been withdrawn.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn Power Purchase Adjustment Cost (PPAC) of around 8 per cent till October.
The regulator had introduced PPAC in 2012 to help the private power distribution companies recover additional cost on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
Delhi gets power from a number of gas and coal-based power generation plants.
The private power distribution companies, particularly, BRPL and BYPL, have been demanding significant hike in tariff, citing rise in power purchase cost.
The withdrawal of PPAC in July had resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
According to DERC figures, the private discoms operating in the city have a revenue gap of a whopping Rs 19,500 crore.
Official figures show that around 80-90 per cent of total continued…

Alibaba will be issuing debt.
In filings with the SEC on Thursday, the Chinese e-commerce giant disclosed plans to issue senior debt to US investors in order to refinance its existing credit facilities.
A report from Bloomberg's Sridhar Natarajan and Zijing Wu, citing two people familiar with the deal, Alibaba is planning to raise up to $8 billion in the offering.
Ratings agencies Fitch and S&P both assigned 'A+' ratings to Alibaba's corporate credit rating. S&P cited the company's "dominant market position in e-commerce in China and the company's minimal financial leverage."
Fitch also described Alibaba's market position as "dominant" and said, "The large size and potential for sustainable growth in China's online shopping market help mitigate Alibaba's limited geographical diversification."
This planned offering comes about two months after the company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in the largest IPO in NYSE history.
Natarajan and Wu reported that Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and JPMorgan will manage the offering.
Singles Day in China was earlier this week, which is similar to the Black Friday or Cyber Monday shopping holidays in the US, and Alibaba announced that it pulled in a record $9.3 billion in sales, a record for the company. Last year, Alibaba's Singles Day sales totaled $5.8 billion.
Earlier on Thursday, Alibaba shares were trading at a record high, just below $120, but in afternoon trade were down about 2% to $115.75.

Tamil Nadu Congress expels G K Vasan’s confidant

Cracking the whip ahead of November 28 meeting of G K Vasan camp, where the senior leader is to launch his party weeks after quitting Congress, the state unit of the party on Friday expelled two of his supporters, including a key confidant.
Tiruchirappalli North District President M Rajasekaran, who is busy in organising the much-hyped public meeting of Vasan, and Kanchipuram (North) Secretary S D Neduchezhiyan were expelled from Congress by TNCC President E V K S Elangovan, a TNCC release said.
Mr. Rajasekaran, a trusted lieutenant of Vasan, hails from a traditional Congress family and had represented Thottiyam constituency in Tiruchirappalli District during 2006-11.
Reacting to his expulsion, Mr. Rajasekaran told PTI that he was very happy with it. “Wait for the launch of the party. Elangovan himself will be on our side.”
Elangovan supporters say that by expelling a “known right hand man” of Mr. Vasan, he has sent out a clear message that “anti-party activities” will not be tolerated “howsoever influential they may be.” Unlike 1996, when the Congress party did not officially expel several leaders though they had deserted to Tamil Maanila Congress, founded by Vasan’s father G K Moopanar, the situation will not be the same this time around, they said.
“At that time (1996), the leadership indefinitely waited for deserters to return. Now, they may get some time to rethink. If nothing happens, action is sure,” a source said.
Mr. Rajasekaran was given time to return. As he continued to work for Mr. Vasan meeting he was expelled, they said.
Elangovan has also done a balancing act by giving charge of Tiruchirapplli North District to his loyalist Jerome Arokiaraj and south district to P. Chidambaram supporter R C Babu.
He has appointed his Tambaram-based follower V R Sivaraman, as Kanchi North District in charge in place of Nedunchezhiyan.
Meanwhile, in Erode, the native of Elangovan, some flex banners with his pictures were found damaged today, triggering protests by Congress workers.
Police said the banners, put up by Congressmen to welcome Elangovan, visiting the town on November 17 after being made the TNCC chief, were found damaged.
Protesting this, Congress volunteers led by Erode DCC President E P Ravi, staged a demonstration demanding that the police arrest the miscreants.
Police rushed to the spot and assured the agitators that they would take stringent action against the persons responsible for the vandalisation, following which they dispersed.

Till October 20, the Income Tax Department had collected Rs. 3,77,652 crore, a growth of 13.6 per cent over the collection in the corresponding period last year.

Shortfall in indirect tax revenue will pull down overall collection growth
The Centre has said it is unlikely to meet its Budget target for tax collection for the third year in a row.
“Though we had not met the target last year, we set too ambitious targets for indirect tax collections for this year in the Budget,” Union Revenue Secretary Shaktikanta Das told The Hindu.
The collections of indirect tax revenue — mainly excise duty, service tax and customs duties — during April-October 2014 was Rs. 2,85,126 crore or 5.6 per cent over the corresponding period the previous year, according to an official release issued on Wednesday.
The Budget target for growth in indirect tax collections is 25.8 per cent.
The projected shortfall in indirect tax revenue will pull down overall tax collection growth even though the direct tax mop-up is likely to meet the Budget target.
“Income tax refunds were enormous but are tapering now and so we are confident we will be able to meet the Budget target for direct tax collections but as was the case last year, the targets set for indirect taxes are too ambitious,” Mr. Das said. The revenue collection target for direct taxes – levied on personal and corporate incomes — for the financial year 2014-15 was fixed at Rs. 7,36,221 crore in the Budget.
Till October 20, the Income Tax Department had collected Rs. 3,77,652 crore, a growth of 13.6 per cent over the collection in the corresponding period last year. However, since it also refunded dues of Rs. 80,850 crore during this period, the growth of the net collections of direct taxes got depressed to about 7 per cent.
Sectors generating black money to be tracked
Union Revenue Secretary Shaktikanta Das told The Hindu that with refunds tapering, the full-year target seemed achievable as normally the bulk of the tax payments come in during the second half of a financial year.
In 2013-14 too, the Centre achieved a total tax collection growth of just about 11.5 per cent against its Budget target of 19 per cent jump to Rs.884078 crore. In 2012-13 too, total tax collection at Rs.741877 crore were about Rs. 40,000 crore short of the Budget target.
Mr. Das also said that the tax department has plans to track down evasion in an un-intrusive manner in sectors prone to the generation of black money. He refused to name the sectors. Besides concealed incomes, among the major sources of the generation of black money is the over-invoicing and under-invoicing of imports into the country which impact the collection of customs duties and other indirect tax collection.
Sales of goods and services in the cash economy, especially without the issue of proper receipts too are a substantial source of black money.

Google contractor accuses company of pay  overtime violations in lawsuit0
How companies classify their workers has received increased attention. In August a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that FedEx drivers are employees under California law, not contractors. It is unclear how that ruling may impact the broader tech sector, though companies like car hire service Uber also consider their drivers to be independent contractors.
In the latest case against Google, plaintiff Jacob McPherson said he began work in 2013 at $35 per hour as a "site merchandiser for magazines" in the Google Play unit. He was classified as a freelancer and paid through an outside agency, the lawsuit said, although he worked in Google's New York offices.
McPherson was limited to billing 30 hours a week but worked more than that. Google declined to pay him for those extra hours, nor for any overtime over 40 hours a week. Google eventually terminated his contract after he asked for more hours to be covered in the contract, the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit alleges claims including violation of federal labor standards and damages.
The case in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York is Jacob McPherson vs. Google Inc et al., 14-9026.

Why is Kim Kardashian allowed to be naked on Instagram  but Chelsea Handler is notBy Caitlin Dewey November 13 Follow @caitlindewey
A (edited!) screenshot of an image Chelsea Handler posted to Instagram. (Instagram)
Kim Kardashian’s bare bottom may not have “broken the Internet” Wednesday, but it certainly appears to have broken Instagram’s moderation queue.
Her butt — and boobs — and faux-surprised naked face — are plastered wall-to-wall on the #Kardashian hashtag. Her full-frontals lie in wait on many a Facebook page, pouncing without so much as a NSFW warning whenever the unsuspecting user scrolls.
It’s not surprising, of course, that the salacious photos are making the rounds, but it seems a little odd on Facebook and Instagram, given that both those networks have taken adamant, controversial anti-nudity stances. Just two weeks ago, comedienne Chelsea Handler ran afoul of the Instagram censors when she posted a picture of herself topless to mock Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the wake of the Kardashian photo shoot, Handler mooned her bathroom mirror and posted that to Instagram, too.
“Just so I’m clear, Instagram,” she wrote. “It’s ok to use nudity to sexualize yourself on your site, but not to make a joke? I’m just so confused.”
Handler is, by all accounts, not the only one bewildered. The nudity policies on Facebook and Instagram remain one of the most misunderstood — and most controversial — guidelines on both sites, in part because their enforcement seems so erratic.
There was, for instance, the British mother whose breastfeeding photo was taken down just last month. (Facebook officially allows breastfeeding photos, even when both breasts are exposed.) Or the woman who was temporarily banned from the site for posting a Coppertone-style picture of her toddler with her butt exposed. Or the French art museum punished for posting a historical nude photograph , purportedly in violation of Facebook’s policy.
“We will post no more nudes, even if we think that their artistic value is great,” the museum said.
But now that we’re confronted with Kim, in all her oddly greasy glory, the censors seem to … no longer care.
In all likelihood, however, it’s not the caring that’s the problem — it’s the fact that moderators are individual people clicking through thousands of pieces of reported content, trying to apply abstract standards to uncomfortably concrete boobs and butts and genitals. Facebook and Instagram both say that nudity is off-limits, except for a narrow band of non-graphic and clearly non-sexual content: post-mastectomy pictures, for instance, or images of women breastfeeding. Both networks also say that they’re okay with nudity in art, provided it isn’t pornographic.
In between those two poles, though — sexual and not sexual, graphic and not graphic — there are many, many shades of gray. So essentially, Facebook charges its moderators with a very difficult task: grappling, as individuals, with questions of morality and sexuality and propriety that we haven’t even solved as a society. Is the body inherently sexual? When is nudity art? Does a full-frontal nude of Kim Kardashian serve any purpose besides … the more obvious ones?
You get the idea.
However you personally answer those questions, it seems inevitable that some bumps and discrepancies will result. It also seems clear that, on the matter of Kim’s booty, at least, Facebook and Instagram have ruled: It’s okay.
It looks like Chelsea Handler might get a pass on this one, too: A full day after she posted it, her personal rear view is, for better or worse, still very much online.

Islamic State  al-Qaeda reach accord in SyriaTwo Syrian opposition figures say the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda's branch met last week.
By: Associated Press | Istanbul | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:17 am
Two Syrian opposition figures say the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda’s branch met last week and agreed to stop fighting each other and work together against their opponents.
The deal could be a heavy blow to Washington’s strategy against the Islamic State group, relying on arming moderate rebel factions to push back extremists in Syria.
A prominent Syrian opposition official and a rebel commander say delegates from the two groups met in secret on November 2 in northern Syria and agreed to end months of fighting between them and cooperate on the ground. The two spoke on condition their names not be used for their own protection or because they were not authorised to release the information.

The danger of signing unconstitutional lawsBy Will Baude November 13
Another interesting side-note that came up during the oral arguments in Zivotofsky was the issue of signing statements — or more specifically, whether it was OK for President George W. Bush to have signed the relevant statute into law (the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003) in light of his constitutional objections. Here’s the signing statement explaining the decision to sign the bill and the objections to part of it.
As it happens, I wrote about this general question a few years ago, noting that it was “common,” but “also controversial” for “the President to sign laws that he thinks are unconstitutional, at least in part.” I suggested that signing unconstitutional laws was sometimes, but not always, constitutionally problematic, and that the ultimate analysis depends on factors like:
– whether the bill has constitutionally permissible portions
– whether some of those constitutionally permissible portions are in fact constitutionally mandatory, i.e., fulfill some of the President’s constitutional duties
– whether there are other steps the President can take to keep the unconstitutional parts from being enforced.
While I didn’t discuss this specific bill, I did discuss several similar ones. Here’s what I said:
For example, the federal government must “guarantee to every State . . . a Republican Form of Government and . . . protect each of them against Invasion.” This obligation is positive, not merely negative; it is not enough for the President to refrain from overthrowing state governments or invading the states himself. The Constitution requires him to protect against invasions by others, and to ensure that their republican governments remain intact. So when the President believes that a measure is necessary to win a war in which American territory is threatened, he not only believes that measure is wise, he also believes that it is required by his constitutional obligations to “protect” the states “against Invasion.”
This suggests that when Congress passes an important national security153 measure that contains a few provisions that are potentially unconstitutional, the President can be justified in signing it. If he signs the law, an unconstitutional provision might be enforced in the future. If not, an invasion might succeed or a republican government might be overthrown. It is hard to lay out a complete calculus of these constitutional risks, but it is implausible that the President is always required to risk an unconstitutional invasion by vetoing a bill with an unconstitutional provision.
The portion of the recent signing statements controversy that condemned President George W. Bush for signing laws he viewed as unconstitutional155 can be assessed in this light; for example, in late 2001, the President signed an intelligence appropriations bill. He explained that it “authorize[d] appropriations to fund United States intelligence activities, including activities essential to success in the war against global terrorism.” At the same time, one provision required the executive to report intelligence matters to Congress more extensively than he thought proper. According to the President, this requirement “in some circumstances, would fall short of constitutional standards,” and therefore would not be applied. By signing the bill while planning to disregard this provision, the President concluded that his duty to protect the country against invasion outweighed the small danger of allowing the potentially unconstitutional reporting requirement to sit ignored in the Statutes at Large.Similarly, the President signed a three hundred billion dollar appropriations bill that he said would “provide[] the resources needed to continue the war against global terrorism, [and] pursue an effective missile defense,” but that also imposed some potentially unconstitutional restrictions, such as notification requirements. Another appropriations bill provided “essential funding to support America’s war on terrorism” and allowed the President “to meet the diplomatic requirements stemming from the September 11th attacks,” but also “purport[ed]” to “interfere with the President’s constitutional authority to conduct the Nation’s foreign affairs.” This pattern recurred throughout many of the unconstitutional laws he signed. One can dispute the President’s judgment in these cases. Perhaps the provisions were not really unconstitutional, or perhaps the constitutional needs for these security measures were not as serious as he said. But my point is that his arguments were correct in form, and if his premises were correct, he acted properly in signing the laws even though he thought them unconstitutional. The unconstitutional provisions that he signed largely affected the executive branch directly, and would not be enforced against the President’s wishes without a concerted effort by other branches.
Again, the recurring question is the balance of constitutional duties and constitutional risks. From the Presidential point of view, there could be a duty-based justification for signing the FRAA, which was said to “provides important new authorities, for diplomatic and related activities of the U.S. Government” and “strengthen our ability to advance American interests around the globe, including nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.” You have to squint a little bit to turn those into the constitutional duties such as the duty to protect the nation, but only a little bit.
On the other hand, signing the provision does create risks that the allegedly unconstitutional provision might be enforced. The President has options to mitigate those risks, but they’re not perfect, so his decision to sign tells us something about how he balanced the risks.
Interestingly, that seems basically consistent with this colloquy from oral argument :
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it had — if it were such a big deal, why did the Chief Executive at the time sign it?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the Chief Executive issued a signing statement which really was, in effect, a disclaimer, in 2002. President Bush’s statement said in 2002, this does not change our official recognition policy and we’re going to treat it as advisory, and that did not have the effect of –
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we should give no weight to the fact that the Chief Executive signed the law that he is now saying has such a dramatic — that his successor, but I gather the position is the same — is now saying has such deleterious effects on American foreign policy? Well, as a general matter, does that have any consequence at all?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I mean, I think this Court held — I think this Court held in Myers that the fact that one President signed a law into — signed a law that violated separation of powers doesn’t have any effect.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. I know, I’m not suggesting it does, although that’s a separate question. But it does go to the credibility of the assertion that this is going to have such dramatic effects on American foreign policy.
As I understand Chief Justice Roberts’s suggestion here, it’s that the President’s decision to sign the bill does not mean that the President thought it was constitutional, but it does tell us something about the President’s assessment of the relative gravity of the constitutional problems. That seems right to me.

Parks group suit: City  Park District can t OK Lucas Museum for lakefront5
A memorandum of understanding between the Park District and the museum specifies that the land where the museum would be located will continue to be owned by the Park District and the cost of constructing and maintaining the building will be paid by the museum.
The memorandum says that the museum “shall have full and exclusive operational control of the museum building” so long as it continues to operate as a museum.
Friends of the Parks President Cassandra Francis said her group views the arrangement as being equivalent to a private entity taking over a public space.
“The city does not have control over what goes into the museum, does not have control over access to the museum,” Francis said. “And while the land may be owned by the Chicago Park District … if it is a long-term lease, it starts looking a lot like ownership.”
Under the group’s legal theory, the General Assembly should decide whether approving the lakefront development would be in keeping with the state’s obligations as a trustee: to preserve the land and make it accessible to the public.
Geoghegan cited Navy Pier as an example of shoreline construction that could clear that test because the pier “actually enhances people’s ability to get to the lakefront.”
But even if lawmakers were to approve the Lucas Museum site, Friends of the Parks would continue to oppose it and would argue that the state had failed in its duty to uphold the public trust, Geoghegan said.
“What this suit is intended to do is to ensure that the lakefront is protected in the future,” he said. “There’s not that much space left and we have to hold on and fight for what we have.”
Much of Chicago along the lake is built on landfill, but Geoghegan said his argument does not have anything to do with structures that have already been built on landfill. Whether existing buildings should have been allowed under the public trust doctrine “is a question that belongs to the past,” he said.

Threat to health subsidies could force state s hand...2
Legislators and interested groups are tweaking the proposal and plan to start moving a revised bill through the process next week, Gabel said.
In Illinois, the subsidies have lowered individual monthly premiums by an average of $202, leaving the average monthly payment around $114, according to a federal report. About 168,000 of the 217,000 Illinois residents who signed up for Obamacare during its first open enrollment period a year ago qualified for the subsidies.
Rep. Patti Bellock, a Hinsdale Republican, said she doubts the proposal will have enough support to reach the House floor. She said she opposes the proposal because of the cost of maintaining an exchange.
"In the situation we're in right now, with the budget being so bad, we thought, 'Why are we going to take on any more expense?'" Bellock said.
If the Supreme Court decides against the subsidies, it would be up to the federal government to find a solution for all the states affected, she said.
"I think this isn't just an Illinois problem," Bellock said. "I would think that this would be a federal problem."
Bellock's concerns were echoed by the Illinois Policy Institute, a free-market group that has been critical of the federal health law. "This is really a cost that Illinois just can't afford to take on, especially given our current budget situation," said Naomi Lopez Bauman, director of health policy for the institute.
Gabel's proposal would tax insurers to fund the exchange.
The 2011 report suggested a range of options to pay the annual costs, from taxing consumers to taxing insurers to drawing on general state funds. Lopez Bauman raised a concern that if the state were to tax insurers, the costs would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums.
"Either way you look at it, taxpayers will be footing the bill for this into perpetuity," she said.
Phillips, of the Campaign for Better Health Care, who spent last year helping consumers navigate the exchanges and select plans, said a state-run exchange would give Illinois more power to implement "pro-consumer regulations." Options could include limiting rates and the number of plans on an exchange, Phillips said. In 2015, for example, Illinois is offering 410 plans, up from 165 last year.
"You could say there has to be a meaningful difference between plans," she said. "When consumers have hundreds of plans, that's overwhelming."
Basic things like design, too, could be better, Phillips said. The state would also have access to enrollment data in real time, instead of waiting on the federal government to release figures.
"Why deny consumers in Illinois the help that they need?" Phillips said. "Why deny them the kind of website they really need to make informed, sound decisions? This is one of the most important decisions they will make."

Plunging oil prices to give big boost to US ...(American consumers are…)
By Nelson D. Schwartz, Clifford Krauss and Dionne Searcey
American consumers are going to enjoy a more bountiful Christmas this year, thanks in part to a most unlikely source: Saudi Arabia.
The steepening drop in gasoline prices in recent weeks - spurred by soaring domestic energy production and Saudi discounts for crude oil at a time of faltering global demand - is set to provide the US economy with a multibillion-dollar boost through the holiday season and beyond.
The windfall, experts say, comes at a critical moment, with the US economy on the upswing but facing headwinds from other quarters, including weaker exports because of slow growth overseas. Gas prices recently dropped below $3 a gallon for the first time since 2010, while crude oil prices have fallen by more than $25 a barrel since midsummer, now closing in on $75 a barrel after a further sharp drop in the past two days.
"If oil prices stay between $75 and $95 a barrel, we would see the kind of stimulus package that the Federal Reserve or Congress could never do," said Douglas R. Oberhelman, the chief executive of Caterpillar, the multinational maker of heavy construction equipment.
The impact is especially significant for low- and middle-income Americans, who have been largely left behind by the anemic economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009. Even as the job market has improved, most workers have received only modest wage increases. Median income remains roughly 5 per cent below the peak it hit in 2007.
To be sure, the shifting energy picture will create losers as well as winners. Falling crude prices could eventually slow surging domestic oil and gas production, dimming one of the major economic bright spots of recent years. But while a further decline in oil prices would make it harder to tap the most costly oil shale deposits and deep offshore reserves, economists say the overall momentum will more than compensate for any potential slowdown in the energy sector.
"When oil prices fall, the benefit to consumers outweighs the loss to producers," said Dean Maki, chief US economist at Barclays. "Investment in oil and gas production is still less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product. Consumer spending is 68.5 per cent of GDP."
Even in Texas, the estimated loss of 15,000 energy-production jobs that might occur if lower crude prices persist would be offset by increased employment in sectors like refining and transportation, as well as in businesses that rely on consumer spending, according to Mine K. Yucel, senior vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
"There may be some slowing, but it's not going to be dramatic if we stay around $80," Yucel said. "If the price goes below $70, we will probably see a tapering off of production."
In the meantime, the most economically fragile part of the population is already feeling some relief, which is likely to lead to extra spending on a variety of other goods and services.
Penny-pinching has been a way of life for Elaine Murszewski since she was laid off from her tech-support job in 2009, but Murszewski, who is self-employed in the Denver suburb of Aurora, says lower gas prices are already making life a little easier.
"If my clients need me to go to their homes, I don't have to worry about my gas tank being empty," said Murszewski, who cobbles together about $900 a month helping two clients organize their offices and run online marketing campaigns.
With Americans spending roughly $1 billion a day on gasoline, Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, estimates that consumers will save roughly $8.4 billion in November and December, compared with the last two months of 2013, based on an average price for regular gasoline of about $2.89 a gallon as opposed to $3.23 last November and $3.26 last December.
The typical American household buys 1,200 gallons annually, so if prices fall to the level Kloza predicts and stay there, that adds up to a yearly savings per household of at least $400. A 15 per cent drop in the cost of home heating oil since last winter should also be helpful, especially as cold weather arrives in the Northeast.
The extra cash in shoppers' wallets and pocketbooks could help generate nearly half a per centage point in added economic growth in the fourth quarter, and roughly $70 billion more in consumer spending over the next year, according to Barclays.
  At Mall of America, a sprawling complex with 500 stores just south of Minneapolis, the drop in gas prices came as welcome news. Almost half of the 40 million visitors a year are out-of-state tourists, and most of them drive to the mall, said Dan Jasper, a mall spokesman.
"If they can save some money on gas, it makes it much easier for families who might be on a budget to hop in that car and come up for the day," Jasper said.

Rupee Hits One-Month Low of 61.77 on Defence-Related Dollar DemandRupee Flat; Asian Currencies Hit as Dollar Rallies
Mumbai: The rupee hit its lowest level in nearly a month on Friday afternoon, weighed down by dollar demand from state-run banks and sharp gains in the greenback versus major currencies.
The partially convertible rupee was trading at 61.77/78 per dollar, its lowest level since October 16 and sharply below its close of 61.5450/5600.
The index of the dollar against six major currencies was up 0.25 per cent.
Traders said there was heavy buying of dollars by state-run banks, likely for defence-related payments.

Anshu Jain gives thumbs-up to govt s smart city approachAnshu Jain
(Sentiment plays a very important…)
In an interview with ET Now, Anshu Jain, co-CEO, Deutsche AG , shares his macroeconomic outlook and talks about the opportunities and challenges that urbanisation in India does throw up. Excerpts:
ET Now: Sentiment seems to be looking up, everybody wants to talk about India. Is India back on the radar? Is this optimism really justified?
Anshu Jain: Sentiment plays a very important role in economies. The mood and optimism on India have definitely picked up.
ET Now: How do we see India's optimism being played out from an outside perspective?
Anshu Jain: The view on India from outside the country, particularly from investors into India, has definitely turned around and in the last six months represents a new level of optimism towards the economy.
ET Now: Growth is slowly beginning to pick up, inflation has cooled off. Will India become an emerging market darling once again? We were on the radar, we slipped. Are we back on the radar as far as emerging markets are concerned?
Anshu Jain: Certainly, the short-term performance of the equity markets suggests so.
ET Now: Are equity markets running ahead of macroeconomic fundamentals?
Anshu Jain: They can sometimes. Time will tell whether that is true for India or not.
ET Now: I particularly want to talk to you about this reform thrust of the government. You come from one of the biggest bankers in the world. The question that one would want to ask you at this stage is, given the majority that this government had, are banking sector reforms something that should be high on their radar?
Anshu Jain: They are high on their radar. We had the fortune of the Finance Minister presenting to us at a conclave and he made it fairly clear that if India is going to fund its growth, then getting the banks back on track and making sure that their balance sheets are capable of expansion is one of his priorities.
ET Now: You are particularly here to discuss urbanisation in India and the challenges that it throws up. This government is very serious about it, it is talking about smart cities, it is talking about bullet trains. Something that has not really been said in the public space so much and because you are particularly speaking about this topic, if I may ask you, what are the opportunities and challenges that urbanisation in India does throw up?
Anshu Jain: Urbanisation would be the greatest opportunity and also one of the big challenges that India is going to face. It is an opportunity because in order to create wealth, it has been fairly demonstrable that as people moved from rural areas into cities, there is a wealth effect which takes place.
In India and China alone, 500 million people, that is twice the population of the United States, will move from rural areas into cities. The government is right to be very focused on urbanization, but equally large cities like the one we are standing in right now also have some tremendous challenges. So pulling together best practice is something which should be smart and the government is right to put it right at the top.
ET Now: What are of the best practices that India can learn from some of the most developed cities in the world?
Anshu Jain: Urban age is our attempt and we are trying to get not just lessons from the developed cities, but indeed a lot of the developing cities. We were in Rio, we were in Mexico City and the fact is that when you take these very large urban clusters, particularly in the developing world, there is a lot they can share with each other.

Cold comfort as France  Germany eke out growth2
The Shanghai composite index <.SSEC> gained 2.9 percent after the downbeat Chinese data added to hopes that China will implement more stimulus to shore up its economy.
"Shockingly, (China's) imports contracted by 6.7 percent year-on-year – their weakest performance since the Lehman crisis (except the volatile Lunar New Year-related period), said Dariusz Kowalczyk, economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.
"This is partly a reflection of lower commodity prices and base effects, but these two factors cannot fully explain the weak import number and we have to assume that poor domestic demand has played a part. This means that pressure will rise on the government to do more to stimulate growth," he said.
The Australian dollar, sensitive to the economic fortunes of China, its main export destination, touched a new 4-1/2 year low of $0.8288 .
The disappointing Chinese and Japanese data contrasted sharply with Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls that showed employment in November surged by 321,000, easily topping forecasts for 230,000 new jobs.
The dollar was steady at 121.515 yen  after touching a new seven-year high of 121.860. The dollar index <.DXY> hovered near a 5-1/2 year high of 89.467.
A bullish dollar worked against crude oil, with the stronger greenback making commodities denominated in the U.S. currency less affordable for holders of other currencies.
Brent crude  lost 92 cents to $68.15 a barrel, approaching a five-year low of $67.53 hit last week, with a forecast cut by Morgan Stanley exacerbating the fall.
The dollar stood tall against the euro, which languished near a two-year low of $1.2270 .
The euro and yen are expected to remain on the defensive against the dollar indefinitely as the strong U.S. jobs data  further contrasted the divergent monetary policy paths of the Fed and its European and Japanese counterparts which are mired   in underwhelming easing schemes.
The Malaysian ringgit  and Indonesian rupiah  fell against the dollar to lows not seen since the 2008-9 global financial crisis after the upbeat U.S. jobs data lifted expectations for an early Fed rate hike.
Higher U.S. interest rates are seen eroding the attractiveness of higher yields in the region.

The country's gross domestic product is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent in 2015, registering the fastest economic expansion among Asian countries, according to Morgan Stanley forecasts of global economies.
The rupee-dollar exchange rate would be at Rs 62.2 by end of 2015 compared to Rs 62 in October-December period, according to a presentation made at the Morgan Stanley's Annual Asia Pacific Summit held in Singapore from November 12-14.
The exchange rate is seen at Rs 62.5 in the first half of 2015 and at Rs 62.3 in the July-september period of 2015.
Comparative to other Asian GDP growths, the domestic economy would have the fastest expansion, Morgan Stanley said in its report.
The country's GDP is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent in 2015, up from 5.3 in 2014, the report said.
"We are constructive on the INR from the outlook perspective," Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley's Chief Asia Economist, told PTI.
Strong capital inflows and the sub-2 per cent current account deficit would add upward pressure on the domestic currency. Reforms are providing confidence in the economic growth of the country, the financial services major said in its report.
The government's policy action to improve business environment and lower oil prices are among the factors supporting the GDP growth , Ahya said.
Structural reforms related to land, labour and tax would support the economy's growth in the coming years. Any disruption to execution and delivery of reforms as well as a slowdown in exports would be a risk, the economist pointed out.
On imports, the lower oil prices have been helpful and supporting the economic growth. Oil imports were down at 4 per cent of the GDP now from 6 per cent in 2012.
"It is obviously helping the recovery process," Ahya said.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley has forecast a sub-par global growth at 3.5 per cent in 2015, up nominally from 3.1 per cent in 2014. Among Asian economies, China's GDP is forecast to contract to 7.1 per cent in 2015 from 7.3 per cent in 2014.
Excluding Japan's GDP, the financial services firm says, Asian GDP would grow to 6.3 per cent in 2015, up marginally from 6 per cent in 2014. Japan's GDP growth would be stagnant at 0.8 per cent in 2014 and 2015.

Apple rules global tablet mkt with 22.3% sh...android
(Apple shipped 12.3 million…)
NEW DELHI: Cupertino-based tech major Apple continues to lead the global tablet market with a 22.3% share in the third quarter of 2014, followed by Samsung with 17.6%, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics.
Apple shipped 12.3 million tablets while Samsung shipped 9.7 million tablets during the quarter. However, Apple's shipments declined 13% annually with few consumers in the developed countries feeling the need to upgrade to the latest product which offer minor changes, the firm said in a statement.
"Newly announced iPad Air 2 and Mini 3, plus the retention of older models at lower price points, will stimulate sales in the coming quarters by providing essentially a wider range of iPad availability in terms of price and specifications. However, growth rates will remain muted until new form factors are introduced," Matt Wilkins , a director in the tablet service at Strategy Analytics, said in the statement. "Apple will win back meaningful high-end market share during the final months of the calendar year."
Asus stood at the third spot with 3.1 million units shipped, or a 5.6% market share. Lenovo's market share surged significantly over last year at 5.4% in the third quarter of 2014 with 3 million shipments.
The research firm said that Lenovo and Asus are demonstrating that innovative form factors provide sufficient product differentiation to drive shipments.
Acer shipped 1.3 million units and acquired a 2.3% market share in the third quarter of 2014.
The overall tablet shipments reached 55.2 million units in the third quarter 2014, up 6% from 52 million in the year earlier period.
Strategy Analytics' tablet service director, Peter King said that the momentum is building in the Enterprise and vertical markets. Future tablet growth will depend on enterprise-class devices used for productivity rather than media consumption.
"Microsoft just recently announced it is putting its full and sustained support behind the ongoing Surface program and the Partner vendors are also supporting Windows Tablets. The next iteration, Windows 10, is expected to drive tablet shipments even further," King added.
Google's Android operating system still dominates the global tablet market with 72% market share with 39.8 million tablet units shipped by all the vendors.
Apple's iOS platform has 22.3% share while Microsoft's Windows OS's market share stood at 5.7% in the third quarter.

Tata Motors Q2 profit falls by 7.1% on weak salesTata Motors Q2 profit falls 7.1 per cent on weak domestic sales, lags estimates

Tata Motors, the country's biggest automaker by revenue, on Friday reported a 7.1 per cent fall in its second quarter profit, missing analysts estimate after weak sales in its domestic business.
The automaker's net profit fell to Rs 3,291 crore (US $533 million) in the second quarter ended September 30, 2014, from Rs 3,542 crore in the corresponding period a year ago, Tata Motors said.
The company's revenue rose 6.5 per cent to Rs 60,164 crore.
Excluding exports, sales of its commercial and passenger vehicles fell by 15.7 per cent during the reporting quarter in the current financial year versus FY14.
Tata Motors has been banking on sales by luxury British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which it bought in 2008, to prop up profits for the past few years.
Analysts on average expected the company to post a profit of Rs 4,620 crore and revenue of Rs 63,428 crore, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

(Tata Motors Ltd, India's…)
MUMBAI: India's largest automobile company by revenues, Tata Motors posted a 7% decline in consolidated net profit for the second quarter ended September, missing the street estimates by a large margin.
Arecord high loss by its domestic operation coupled with revaluation of currency (£85 million), higher tax provision and increased depreciation cost at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) took a toll on the consolidated profits for the second quarter of FY15. The consolidated net profit for Q2 stood at Rs3,291 crore against Rs3,542 crore posted in the same period last year. The consolidated net revenues for the period grew 6.5% and the EBIDTA margin too expanded by 70 basis po ints to 17% in the quarter.
Reviewing the Q2 earnings C Ramakrishnan, CFO, Tata Motors said, as far as JLR is concerned, a higher tax provisioning and more importantly, JLR had a lot of new projects getting launched and the company is continuing to invest in lot of new products, so the depreciation and amortisation charge is also growing. "It is, however, a non-cash expenditure. Apart from this, there was a marginal revaluation of currency. Its domestic business had a certain amount of reversals of tax credits," said Ramakrishnan.
While JLR reported a healthy margin expansion of 190 basis points to a whopping 19.4% EBIDTA margins, a single digit growth in volumes, meant revenues were only marginally up 4.2% to £4,808 million (Rs46,455 crore) and PAT fell 11.24% to £450 million (Rs4,347.9 crore).
On the JLR front, the new models XE and Discovery Sport will help build the sales momentum in 2015 and the Chinese JV will start commercial production, which will help meet the demand in China more aggressively. The region makes up for over a quarter of sales for JLR.
Closer home the signs of a pick up in sentiment, has resulted in growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment, but the company says the real growth is only expected next year. And on the passenger vehicle front, a large part of its portfolio is struggling, with only saving grace being, the newly launched Zest, which the company claimed had a good response from the market with over 10,000 units sold so far. However, this had little impact on the standalone earnings.
On a standalone basis, the condition has turned from bad to worse. The standalone loss has more than doubled toRs1,846 crore, which is the highest ever loss in the company's history with a negative EBIDTA of Rs145 crore and a EBIDTA margin of which was a negative 1.7%.

Krishi Mela begins at UAS-R campuseducation
Thousands of farmers and agriculture enthusiasts from different parts of Hyderabad Karnataka thronged the University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur (UAS-R) campus on Friday, the first day of the annual Krishi Mela.
The three-day event, aimed at introducing newer agricultural and allied technologies to farming community, included 200 exhibition stalls by agricultural and horticultural universities, government departments, non-governmental agencies, private seed and fertiliser companies.
UAS-R will showcase two new seed varieties - SIRI-1253 (paddy) and DSB-21 (soybean) - and an e-Solution Against Agricultural Pests (e-SAP) technology. Students enthusiastically explained to vistors how the e-SAP installed tablet would pictorially provide complete information about pest attack, virus infest and other diseases to specific crops at various stages of their development.
Other technologies demonstrated were: mechanised paddy transplanter, watershed development technology, drip and sprinkler irrigation methods and varietal and chawki rearing technologies in sericulture. On all three days an interactive session will be organised for farmers to share their experiences to agricultural scientists and experts.
"These session where farmers share their rich experiences is useful not only for farmers, but also for agriculture scientists. There would be a lot to learn for university scientists from both the successes and the failures of farmers," , Vice Chancellor of the University P M Salimath told The Hindu. Minister of State for Agriculture Krishna Byre Gowda would participate in the Mela on Saturday, he added. (eom)

Top MBA programmes ensure quality graduatesStory
A Passport to Success
A professional course like MBA has two major objectives - acquiring business education and skills during the two-year programme, and acquiring that dream job at the end of the programme.

Top Indian MBA programmes, like other top-notch qualifications, are, in effect, talent screening mechanisms. Since only the top one per cent of applicants make it there, recruiters are assured of a minimum level of quality. For those aspiring to a career in business, admission into one of the top 20 MBA programmes is indeed a passport to success. This is true for those graduating from the IITs, AIIMS, SRCC, the National Law Schools and others, where admissions are very difficult.
Indian MBA schools take in students at younger ages of 21 to 24, with little or no work experience. American top-ranked programmes have older students with more work experience, with an average age of 26 to 29. The first two IIMs in the country, IIM Calcutta and IIM Ahmedabad, had 70 per cent students with less than two years of experience in the 2013 class. Here, recruiters have little by way of track record to differentiate among applicants. They, therefore, rely more on the initial talent filtering offered by these MBA institutes.
A professional course like MBA has two major objectives-acquiring business education and skills during the two-year programme, and acquiring that dream job at the end of the programme. Usually, the second is more important to most students, who see this as return on investment in the MBA. For evaluating MBA rankings, placement is a very important criteria for both recruiters and students. The BT rankings have other criteria as well, including learning experience and future orientation. These would perhaps not be as important as placement. This was underscored to me during a recent meeting of a top MBA programme's advisory body.

As far as learning during the two-year programme goes, most top MBA graduates, five years into their careers, would perhaps agree that while their academic inputs were stimulating, their learning outside classrooms, especially from fellow students, was equally significant. Most of us would say such learning from a diverse set of peers and students was even more educative. At the middle- and top-management levels, the alumni network of the institute is an asset for most MBAs. Here, US schools have much that Indian B-schools can learn from, including organising an annual business event where big hitters from industry are invited. A Wharton or Harvard is actually easier to get into than the IIMs, but their alumni networks and global reach is far more effective.
Academic inputs do provide a framework for actions in the corporate world. There are indeed outstanding teachers who are 'rock stars', challenging minds and providing great learning experiences. But for the most part, freshly minted Indian MBAs need further training in a corporate environment. I have been part of a private equity fund that believed in hiring MBAs only after they'd acquired two years of post-MBA experience.
There is also a need for more life skills among fresh MBAs, who seem to value only the technical and subject-matter courses offered as electives. At our silver jubilee reunion, an IIM director agreed that more soft skills are needed at all career stages, including the first five years. However, there was little inclination among students to opt for such 'softer' electives. One would strongly recommend the top MBA schools getting their alumni to deliver guest lectures on the importance of such life skills, in an era where teamwork and collegial skills are much more important than working with screens alone, whether computer or smartphone.
For MBA aspirants, therefore, if you have less than two years of work experience, go through the talent screening mechanism and get to a top Indian MBA programme. If you've been working longer than three years, try getting into a global top MBA, much easier to make it there. Either way, enjoy your two-year stint on the campus!

Investing mistakes you must avoidInvesting mistakes you must avoid

Investing money is a process that requires an investor to plan, adopt a disciplined investment strategy and have the perseverance to weather the volatile periods during the committed time horizon. Although many of us find investment process quite cumbersome, in reality, it is a simple process provided we follow certain basic principles at all times. Unfortunately, not many investors do so and hence end up making too many mistakes thus derailing their investment process.
For example, it is quite common to see investors trying to buy low and sell high despite it being a proven fact that even the professional fund managers find it difficult to time the market consistently. Moreover, it is ironical that when the market presents great long-term investment opportunities, the same investors get cold feet. Clearly, their fetish for catching the market bottom often makes them vary of taking the plunge.
                                           
Similarly, there are a few other common mistakes that cloud investors' investment decisions. If you are one of those investors who have been committing investment mistakes, here is how you can avoid them:
Don't look at investment options with rose coloured spectacles
While there is nothing wrong with expecting the best possible returns on your investments, it is important to know about the potential and the risk associated with different asset classes in your portfolios. Many investors make the mistake of focusing only on the returns and ignoring the attendant risks. This not only causes a mismatch between the reality and expectations in terms of returns but also makes it difficult for them tackle the volatility. No wonder, they often panic and abandon their investment process abruptly, thereby, either suffering huge losses or failing to achieve their important investment goals. To avoid a situation like this, the key is not to underestimate risk and/or overestimate returns. Therefore, you must understand the potential and the risks associated with different asset classes so that you have a clear idea about the risk you are likely to be exposed to and the kind of return you can expect from your portfolio.   
Don't compromise your goals for some quick gains
We often make a mistake of either investing without a defined time horizon or assigning our investments to certain specific goals. Hence, we often lose sight of our goals when we spot an opportunity to make a quick buck. For example, in a current market like situation, one can get tempted to invest even short money into equity and equity related instruments. Needless to say, if the market turns volatile, one would find it difficult to stay invested and hence may end up either losing a part of one's investments or earning low returns. Therefore, the right strategy to achieve investment success would be to keep your focus on your goals and honour the time commitment for each of your goals.
Don't over-diversify your portfolio
While maintaining diversification in your portfolio as an integral part of the achieving investment success, it is also an aspect where investors often err. The general belief is that more number of funds one invests in, the more diversified portfolio would be. One often comes across portfolios where an amount as low as Rs 5,000 is invested through SIP [systematic investment plan] in five funds.
Remember, mutual funds are a diversified investment vehicle and having a number of similar funds can harm the portfolio in more than one ways rather than adding any value to it. For example, while having a quality mid-cap fund can help improve your overall portfolio returns, investing in too many mid-cap funds would invariably make you compromise on the quality of the portfolio as stock picking and sound investment process are major differentiators for these funds. Considering that mid-cap segment suffers from poor liquidity and limited coverage, it is always prudent to opt for a mid-cap fund or two that not only have quality portfolios but also an established performance track record.  
While there is nothing like an optimal number of funds that you need to own to have a sufficiently diverse portfolio, factors such as the size of your portfolio and your asset allocation can help you decide the optimal number.  For example, the debt part of the portfolio may require you to invest in more funds as the key is to manage credit and duration risk. To do so successfully, you will have to invest in different funds suitable for different time horizons.   
Don't be obsessed with past performance
                                         
Although past performance is an important aspect in the decision-making process, relying too much on it can jeopardise your financial future. Even while considering the past performance, you must focus on long-term performance rather than the short term one.  
Mutual funds offer a variety of equity funds, i.e., multi-cap, large cap, mid-cap, sector, thematic and those that follow an aggressive investment strategy such as opportunity and value funds. As we know, different segments of the stock markets behave differently over different time periods. For example, in the current market scenario, you will find either mid-cap funds or funds having higher exposure to mid-cap stocks, sector and thematic funds dominating the list of top performing funds. A strategy of investing in top performing funds now could result in your portfolio becoming too aggressive for your liking and that can be disastrous in the long run.
Similarly, a performance analysis of equity and equity-oriented funds during the periods of market downturns would project a disappointing picture. Relying on the past performance alone would compel you to stay away from equities during the periods best suited for making an investment. Besides, a conservative approach will create a gap between what you will need and what you may accumulate in future. Hence, you must look beyond past performance to make sound investment decisions.
Don't ignore time diversification
Time diversification, i.e., remaining invested over different market cycles is another factor that requires your attention. It helps in mitigating the risks that you might encounter while entering or exiting a particular investment or category during difficult times in the economic cycle. Remember, longer time periods minimise the impact of these fluctuations.
In fact, time diversification is also important for the debt part of the portfolio. While investing in ultra short-term debt funds, short-term debt funds and fixed maturity plans (FMPs) is fairly straight forward, investing in medium to long-term income funds, especially those that rely on duration play, can be a little tricky. It is important to know that interest rates and bond prices have an inverse relationship. When the interest rates start falling, the market adjusts bond prices to increase the interest rate yields, i.e., their price rise.
Of course, income funds following the duration strategy are ideally suited to investors who don't mind taking risk to earn a few percentage points higher returns. Here too, as has been seen in the past, many investors wait for the performance numbers to improve before taking the plunge. Many a times, they enter at the fag-end of the rally in the bond prices and hence not only miss out on an opportunity to make decent returns but also risk a part of their capital.
As is evident, you need to look beyond the past performance to benefit from the true potential of different asset classes. A combination of factors such as suitability of investment options in the portfolio, following a disciplined approach to investing and staying committed to your time horizon can work wonders for your investments in the long run. 

FATCA: The last-minute rushPranay Bhatia and Kriyang Karia        Last Updated: November 4, 2014  | 12:01 IST
Pranay Bhatia, Partner, BDO India LLP
It was anticipated that with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US, uncertainty over FATCA implementation would come to an end.  However, the Indian government is yet to make any announcements on the FATCA implementation after giving an in-principle approval to FATCA Inter Governmental Agreement (IGA) -Model -1, few months back.
FATCA is a US federal law that requires United States persons, including individuals who live outside the US, to report their financial accounts held outside of the US, and requires financial institutions across the world to report to the IRS about their US clients. The local government supports and becomes a signatory to FATCA (by signing an IGA with the US), making FATCA a local law in the signatory country. The IGA approach was developed to address issues faced under direct reporting regime. The impacted financial institutions will have to register with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN) is issued to the registering institutions.  
Kriyang Karia, senior manager at BDO India LLP
Given that India has adopted Model-I IGA, Indian financial institutions had to obtain GIIN before end of this year as against July 1, 2014. After initially analyzing the impact of FATCA, Indian financial institutions are waiting for further guidance for implementation. It appears that FATCA implementation may coincide with the tax compliance season adding weight on financial institutions' bunch of existing compliance.
What is stopping finalization of IGA may only be speculated. It is either India's willingness to time it with OECD's automatic exchange mandate or it is US' reluctance to grant reciprocation of information. It is learnt that the mutual fund industry had called for negotiating, with the Indian government, specific exemption for mutual funds from FATCA reporting.  Even the broking community had called for similar exemption.  As a fall out of FATCA and other US regulations, the Indian mutual funds have stopped accepting fresh investments from US investors.  
In the interim, the RBI and Sebi advised banks and other financial intermediaries to keep the registration with IRS on hold until further announcements. However, the RBI and SEBI had to make exceptions for financial institutions having branches in countries that have either agreed to Model-II IGA or where final FATCA regulations apply. The time line to obtain registration for branches in these countries was before July 1, 2014 with the Indian entity being the registering entity. In view of this exception, some banks and intermediaries would already have the GIIN in place. The others are waiting for further clarifications.
A little over two months are left to register with the IRS and obtain GIIN.  However, in the current state of things, Indian financial institutions, to ensure implementation and compliance, will need to grapple with many changes at the last moment. To name a few, on-boarding documentation, changes in the IT system to absorb further details and produce required reports, in-house trainings.
Indian financial fnstitutions would also expect the government to roll out the guidance notes to the complicated FATCA regime. The guidance notes can be expected in lines with the UK Guidance, which too was recently updated. A more simplified version with references to and formats of the relevant forms for declarations and reporting would definitely be appreciated.
However, from the Indian government's perspective, FATCA is only one of the various compliance mandates it is dealing with. At the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Convention), a multilateral agreement was developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The agreement mandates the consenting jurisdiction to exchange information for tax matters on an automatic basis, to other consenting jurisdictions. India was the first non-OECD country to ratify this Convention in February 2012. In February 2014, the OECD released the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters as endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers and approved by the OECD council. More than 65 countries and jurisdictions have committed to implementation of the OECD standard.  More than 40 countries, including India, have committed to a specific and ambitious timeline of first automatic information exchange in 2017, which includes both, OECD and non-OECD countries. More jurisdictions are expected to commit to implement the OECD standard. This mandate is also popularly known as GATCA. The Indian government will have to work around building systems and processes to fulfill both, FATCA and GATCA, mandated exchange of information.
It is certain that FATCA will be a reality, soon. Financial institutions will have to eventually register with IRS and obtain GIIN. To register, the financial institutions will have to determine their FATCA status viz. Financial or non-financial entity, reporting or non-reporting financial entity, exempt or non-exempt entity. In addition to FATCA, financial institutions will have to gear up for GATCA and future proof their efforts in a bid to comply with information exchange mandates.
All eyes are now on the FATCA announcement. One could only hope that the guidance notes are rolled out sooner for a hassle free transition to the cost heavy compliance mandate. However, it will be interesting how the financial industry deals with non-US, foreign investors, after the introduction of GATCA.

How Anmol Bakers trod the success pathEnjoying his cuppa: Anmol Bakers' MD Gobind Ram Choudhary at his company's Greater Noida plant (Photo: Shekhar Ghosh)
CATEGORY: Outstanding Capital Management (Mid-sized Companies)
During its 13-year existence, Anmol Bakers has seen several ups and downs. Before setting up a plant in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, Gobind Ram Choudhary, its Managing Director, was running a bakery business in Kolkata with his father and three brothers. Shifting to the north, however, proved to be quite challenging as the company faced many challenges.
First, the business skills that Choudhary learnt in Kolkata were of no help due to the different nature of the two markets. For instance, the attrition rates are much higher in the north. Also, the company's demand for staff was three times more than in Kolkata. Then, the consumption patterns of biscuits were different and so the competencies required for sales, marketing and distribution functions varied between the two regions. Furthermore, both markets are different in terms of product preferences. In the east, the per capita annual consumption of biscuits was almost double that of the north's five kilogram.
So, for the first four years, Anmol Bakers grew at around 25 per cent but in the following years, the growth began to taper off. As a result, the company turned its focus on reducing production costs to protect profit margins. Initially, Choudhary hired consultants to fix the problems that existed in the sourcing and inventory management. But it didn't work. Later, he himself started looking for solutions.

"We shifted to a lean manufacturing process," says Choudhary. Anmol changed its raw material sourcing methods. Take the sourcing of milk powder, for instance. About five years ago, the company would order 10 tonnes of milk powder every fortnight. This was changed to five tonnes a week, thereby reducing the working capital requirement and also the overall interest cost that Anmol would bear on bank loans. "Historically, we used to follow this practice of placing large orders assuming that buying in bulk was cost effective for us. But when I analysed, I could see no benefit in it," added Choudhary.
His next target was to rework inventory management systems for finished products. Earlier, the company's sales team would make predictions about demand and production planning was done accordingly. This resulted in retailers getting products with a time lag. Today, Anmol maintains a minimum stock level at all its warehouses. "We used to store finished products worth about Rs 8 crore at our warehouses. This has been brought down to Rs 5 crore now. We were able to free up capital that was stuck in our warehouses," revealed Choudhary.
In addition, the retailers get fresh products and the amount of wastage has been reduced. "We cannot predict sales. None of our products at the retailers' level would be older than two months as against four months before," says Choudhary, who spends his free time attending management classes or reading related books.
Harminder Sahni, Founder and Managing Director of Wazir Advisors, says the biscuits market in India is broadly divided into three segments. ITC and Britannia , which focus on product innovation, are at the top end. Parle operates in the middle. and Priyagold and Anmol are at the bottom end with emphasis on volume-driven growth. "They don't spend as much on marketing and branding and have healthy profit margins," says Sahni. Anmol's target market stands at Rs 20,000 crore, as per market research firm Nielsen. The market didn't grow in 2013/14, but Anmol grew 16.7 per cent to post revenues of Rs 350 crore.

Govt should be cautious amid major reformsAnilesh S Mahajan      Follow @anileshmahajan    Edition: Nov 23, 2014
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (Photo: Reuters)
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been lucky. In his maiden Budget speech in July, he had worried about the possible impact of surging global crude oil prices on the economy. As it happens, crude prices have fallen by 30 per cent since then. This in turn has given Jaitley the leeway to push for a number of energy reforms.
On October 18, he made two crucial announcements - the government was lifting its control over diesel prices and a new formula had been arrived at to determine the price of locally produced natural gas. Both had been long awaited, but were deferred earlier because they were politically sensitive. Yet such is Jaitley's fortune - given the low price of global crude - that far from increasing it, de-control reduced the price of diesel and in coming days may bring it down further. The new gas formula raised the price of natural gas produced at NELP blocks from $4.2 to $5.61 per mmBtu (million metric British thermal units).
Two days later, Jaitley declared the Cabinet had decided to pass an ordinance amending the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, which will allow e-auctioning of coal blocks for captive use, and permit private players to take part. This will mitigate the crisis that had arisen since the Supreme Court , in September, cancelled all coal block allotments to private parties by previous governments from 1993, terming them arbitrary.
The government will need to protect genuine investments already made by private players in developing coal blocks
RAJIV KUMAR
Senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Research
The steps announced will increase government income and cut subsidies, making it easier for Jaitley to achieve his target of reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent in 2014/15. In 2013/14, the government's fuel subsidy amounted to $10.6 billion, the bulk of it on diesel. In the next three months, the government also intends to stop subsidised sale of LPG cylinders altogether, and replace it with direct cash transfer of subsidy to the bank accounts of those entitled. This too is expected to curb leakages and trim the subsidy bill. "But more than raising revenues, these decisions indicate the direction in which the government is thinking," says a senior finance ministry official.
The hike in the price of natural gas is a bit of a damp squib for the gas exploration companies as they were pushing for a much steeper hike. In the closing months of the previous UPA government's rule, the then chairman of the prime minister's Economic Advisory Council, C. Rangarajan, had suggested a formula that would have raised the price to more than $8 per mmBtu. The Narendra Modi government put this decision on hold on coming to power.
The new price will enable gas producers to make profits, but there will be no windfall
DHARMENDRA PRADHAN
Petroleum Minister
The Rangarajan formula used weighted averages of the gas price at different international hubs to determine what India's price should be. The new formula follows the same pattern, but has dropped the Japanese index along with Indian import prices and included Russian and Canadian indices. The Japanese index is considered to be aggressive as it is linked directly to volatile crude oil prices. Also, Japan is heavily dependent on imported fuel, which keeps prices high. "We have included the relevant and excluded the irrelevant," said Jaitley at a press conference soon after. Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, too, expressed his satisfaction. "The new price will enable gas producers to make profits, but there will be no windfall," he added.
A good deal of damage, however, has already been done. Power producers relying on natural gas, for instance, are saddled with huge debts and idle capacity. (Between them, they have made a total investment of Rs 1.2 lakh crore for an installed capacity of 24 gigawatts.) No doubt the government has asked public sector gas producer GAIL to reduce its margins and allowed the power producers to charge for fixed costs at Rs 1.10 per kilowatt hour, instead of 85 paise as before. It will let gas-based plants renegotiate their debts with banks as well. But that is not enough since fixed costs are actually much higher.
The changes will enable gas based power plants to run at about 40 per cent of their capacity. "To make profits, we need to utilise at least 75 per cent," says Isaac George, Chief Financial Officer at GVK Infra. "But we will be able to service some of our debt and survive. This is a good first step of the government, but it must push reform further." He hopes the government will also pool domestic and imported gas - the latter is much more expensive since it is shipped in liquid form and re-gassified again- and make it available at the same price. The petroleum ministry is expected to decide on this by January.
Experts have responded similarly to the change in the mining law. "It is a cautious initial step," says Kameswara Rao, Leader of Energy and Mining Practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, India. As Coal Minister Piyush Goyal clarified de-nationalisation of coal is not yet being considered: Coal India's monopoly as sole commercial coal miner remains untouched. Successful bidders at the e-auction will only sell their coal to companies it is marked for, with the coal regulator - to be set up after the relevant bill is passed by Parliament, possibly in the coming winter session - keeping an eye on prices. But the ordinance, together with the very setting up of a regulator, is an indication of which way the wind is blowing. "The government's vision is to move towards commercial mining, but things should happen in a logical order," says a senior official at coal ministry.
Some experts feel there is much to be done beyond de-nationalisation of coal. "The government will need to protect genuine investments already made by private players in developing coal blocks," says Rajiv Kumar, Economist and Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research. "There has to be robust regulation, which also takes environmental factors into account. A law on FDI in coal mining will be needed as well." Indeed, coal reform is all the more important given the fuel's uncertain future. "The sooner you de-nationalise the better," adds Kumar. "In the next 15-20 years, there will be huge movements against the use of coal. You cannot afford a monopoly where output stagnates."
Reform at the state-level power distribution companies (discoms) is on the anvil, too. The power ministry has finalised a model Electricity Distribution Fiscal Responsibility Act - primarily reducing the scope for political interference in deciding tariffs - which it wants states to replicate. It is also working out the details of the Deendayal Gram Jyoti Yojna, which will segregate power for agriculture from that for rural domestic needs. This, too, will help discoms curtail losses.
"The new establishment has ambitious plans of fixing country's infrastructure , agriculture and making it a manufacturing hub," says Anis Chakravarthy, Economist at global consultancy Deloitte Touche Tomastu. "All this might require more public funding."

Sentiss expects to touch Rs 1 500 cr sales in 5 yrsStory

The word Sentiss is derived from two words - sensory and Switzerland (sen plus Swiss). Gurgaon-based Sentiss Pharma, promoted by Managing Director Deepak Bahri, is in the business of making medicines for the sensory organs (eye, ear, nose, throat and skin) but at the moment is more focused on eye care products. And it sees Switzerland emerging as its future global marketing and distribution hub - its office was opened in the country in 2013.
Sentiss Pharma was originally launched in 1990 as a partnership firm, Promed Exports. It exported a range of products (formulations) largely to Russia, sourced through contract manufacturing in India. In 2006, it set up its own R&D centre in Gurgaon and in the following year established a manufacturing plant in Himachal Pradesh.
Today, it manufactures almost all its products in-house in India. Ophthalmic products make for almost 95 per cent of its total sales. Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and India are its major markets. "We entered the Indian market in 2011 and plan to double our field force here in the next two to three years," says Bahri, 52.
FULL COVERAGE: India's Best Emerging Companies 2014
Bahri's company spends about seven to 10 per cent of its total sales per annum on R&D which, he asserts, is a lot for a company with a turnover of Rs 250 crore. "We encourage creativity and innovation, and give awards to people who come up with new products, processes and ideas. We encourage them to file patents," says Bahri. "So far, we have filed 36 patents in different countries." The company has a headcount of about 750 - some 550 of these are based in India. The R&D team has about 50 people, all based in Gurgaon.
Sentiss has also been actively working with Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, and with Delhi Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research (DIPSAR). The company developed two herbal eye drops through these collaborations - for glaucoma and ophthalmic patients. It was awarded a patent for the glaucoma product in March 2014. "They are very focused and working in the field of eye research. It is very unique and not many companies do this, and they seem to be in the right direction," says Prof. S.K. Gupta, Emeritus Professor and former head of Pharmacology at DIPSAR.
Russia and CIS countries (largely Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) contribute about 85 per cent of the total revenues of Sentiss, generated almost entirely through eye care products. The company is now targeting the US market. "We had Food and Drug Administration inspection in March last year, subsequent to which we received a warning letter and investigators observations, They did another inspection in July this year and the company took up further areas for improvement. We hope to enter the US market next year," says Bahri.
In all, the company has some 40 products in its kitty. The focus in the future will not be just on ophthalmic but also on ENT (ear, nose, throat) products. Sentiss has been growing at 20 to 25 per cent but hopes to step it up to 35 to 40 per by entering new markets and expanding its product portfolio. The share of India in total revenues currently is just four per cent but the company hopes to see it touch 10 per cent over the next few years. Sentiss expects to touch sales of Rs 1,500 crore in the next five years.
The future then appears to hold promise for the company.

Luthra maintained a punishing schedule in the early years of VLCC, working from 5:30 am to 10 pm daily, to make the venture a success. She is a wellness expert herself and has completed advanced programmes in beauty and wellness from different parts of Europe, including London.
VLCC is striving to become a global wellness brand. It has 300 salons across 121 cities and 16 countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Malaysia, Singapore, the UAE, and Kuwait. "In any kind of job, one has to be committed to succeed," says Luthra.

The company's top line has been growing at over 30 per cent annually over the past few years. VLCC refuses to divulge the proportion of revenues that comes from its international operations, but has aggressive expansion plans. Luthra intends to ramp up turnover five-fold to Rs 5,000 crore in the next three years with growing contribution from its overseas business.
VLCC focuses on three business segments - wellness services, training, and skin-care and body-care products. It's hard to find another similar wellness services chain globally, says Sandeep Ahuja, Managing Director, VLCC. "The biggest bottleneck of this industry is well-trained manpower. To address this, the VLCC Academy of Training was opened in 2001. It has 54 campuses across the world and every year it trains 8,000 professionals," he says. The training business contributes about 10 per cent to its total turnover. VLCC is also working with the Directorate General of Employment & Training (DGET), Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India, to raise the bar of vocational training in the sphere of beauty and nutrition in India.

VLCC was relatively small till 2001 with some 35 centres. Thereafter, it started scaling up aggressively. Funds came from global investors. CLSA and Everstone, for instance, invested in VLCC in 2004 and 2007, respectively. It opened its first store abroad in Dubai in 2005, followed by expansion in other emerging markets such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and Malaysia. It has launched operations in Kenya in August and now plans to expand in East Africa. "A lot of entrepreneurs entering the wellness industry aspire to create a 'VLCC-like product'," says Dr. Manish Patwardhan, Director, Spa Consultants.
Meanwhile, the future in India holds promise for beauty and wellness business players like VLCC. According to the KPMG Wellness Sector Report 2014, released in April 2014, the next decade will lead to opening up of the beauty market as the Indian youth, who account for more than half of the country's population, want to be physically fit and look and feel good. Luthra wants to position VLCC as a strong brand. And given her track record, it is clear she means business.

How we picked India s Best Emerging firms for 2014Team BT     Delhi   Edition: Nov 23, 2014
(L to R): Dilip Chenoy of National Skill Development Corporation, AT Kearney's Debashish Mukherjee, BT's Josey Puliyenthuruthel, YES Bank's Amit Kumar, Om Manchanda of Dr Lal PathLabs, Jyoti Sagar of J. Sagar Associates, and PwC India's Shashank Jain
One of the highs of business journalism is to be able to spot a small, unheralded company, and see it grow to heights perhaps the company itself had not believed in. In today's digital and stock market-driven age, that elusive find has become even more, well, elusive. Which is why, last year, we put a structure to the effort by launching the Emerging Companies Excellence Awards in collaboration with knowledge partner YES Bank and procedure reviewer partner PwC India. The objective: assess the finances of unlisted companies and reward the top performers.
In its second year, we made several tweaks to the process. The number of award categories went up from nine to 15. Six of the awards based on financials - business scalability, operational excellence, capital management, employment creation, global business excellence and overall winners - were split into large and mid-sized groups. The two voluntary participation awards - for corporate governance and for innovation - had one winner each. And, we dropped the award for CSR and sustainable development, and introduced the Woman-led Emerging Company award.
The upper bar for companies to qualify was raised from net sales of Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 1,500 crore. The lower bar remained at Rs 200 crore. This helped us create the two groups - large companies (net sales of Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,500 crore), and mid-sized companies (Rs 200 crore to Rs 500 crore).

Last year, to build awareness about the survey, we did not apply any restriction on the age of a company, so long as it was in business more than five years. This year, we brought in a maximum existence cap. So, only companies that incorporated between 1990 and 2008 qualified to participate. (We also felt that younger companies deserved to score higher, so a "recency" weightage was introduced.) You can see the other qualifying parameters in the table alongside.
Like last year, the starting point was data of unlisted companies from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The application form, which captured essential financial data of three years - 2012/13, 2011/12 and 2010/11 - was then distributed to companies on this list by YES Bank. The application form was also made available online. This year, 705 companies applied from all over India, compared to 526 last year.
YES Bank's analytics team went to work on the numbers after that. After the global filters were applied (see table alongside), 287 companies progressed to the second phase. Audited financial reports and other information were then sought from these companies.
Phase II was split into two parts - generic evaluation and award-specific evaluation. Generic evaluation was based on parameters like three-year profit margin growth, revenue growth, return on capital employed, etc. This was followed by award-specific evaluations. For example, for global business excellence, parameters such as exports growth, exports' share of total sales, number of countries exported to, etc. were used. Employment creation was as much about growth in employee numbers as in the relation between rising employee numbers and total assets.
Different sectors have differing characteristics. A manufacturing company cannot be fairly compared to a service sector company. To factor in these differences, peer set comparison was done and top performers from each sector were shortlisted for evaluation.
For the non-financial awards such as those for corporate governance and for innovativion, relevant parameters such as corporate governance policy, spending on R&D, products/patents, leadership background were considered. A group of experts - industry leaders and academicians from varied sectors (see list alongside) - was also surveyed and their scores taken into consideration.
The generic evaluation and award-specific evaluation scores were then combined in 40:60 weights to arrive at final scores for Phase II. The results of each phase were reviewed by PwC India, and their suggestions and corrections were incorporated. The top three scoring companies in each category were then presented before a jury panel.
The jury was chaired by Jyoti Sagar, Chairman & Founder of J. Sagar Associates, and also comprised Debashish Mukherjee, Partner at AT Kearney; Dilip Chenoy, MD & CEO of National Skill Development Corporation, and Om Manchanda, CEO of Dr Lal PathLabs. Technical and knowledge assistance was provided by Amit Kumar, Group President & Country Head, Corporate and Commercial Banking, YES Bank and Shashank Jain, Executive Director, PwC India. The discussion was moderated by Josey Puliyenthuruthel, Managing Editor of Business Today.

Saradha scam siphoned off Rs 242 cr  says SFIOSFIO report reveals Rs 242 cr siphoned off by Saradha scam
SPS Pannu     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 11:51 IST

The Sen song of the Saradha Scam has been unveiled, and it makes for some pretty interesting listening. Ponzi Prince and chief architect of the Rs 2,459-crore Saradha scam Sudipta Sen knew well before the whistle finally blew that his game was up.
The high-profile investigation into the investment scam that continues to rock Bengal's political establishment and snare heavyweights has now revealed that Sen in his deposition recorded under Section 240 (2) of the Companies Act, 1956 stated that "the returns at higher rates were promised but it is not possible to provide such returns with a business model followed by the companies".
Corroborating Sen's line of thinking, his accomplice in the defrauding of thousands of investors, Debjani Mukherjee, said in her statement before the Enforcement Directorate , "It was known to Sudipta Sen by April 2013 that the company was doomed. Whenever she asked him (Sen) whether the company would be able to continue to pay the returns to the public, Sen said he knew "how to return the money to the public.
The business belongs to him, but it is true, maybe not in April 2013, but someday it will come down crashing." As much as 93 per cent of the total collections were in cash. No less than Rs 1,983 crore of the Rs 2,459 crore is still outstanding from depositors who put in less than Rs 50,000 each. Of this, Rs 242.62 crore has been misappropriated by Sen, Mukherjee and other directors for their personal benefit.
THE SOURCE
An extremely damaging 516-page Serious Fraud Investigation Office report reveals this and much more. The SFIO-part of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs setup to investigate white collar crime-report provides a comprehensive and overarching account of the way Saradha Group companies deceived and fraudulently induced depositors by offering an abnormally high 18 per cent return. It also shows how the Sen cookie crumbled. Monthly Income Scheme (MIS) deposits, for instance, collected Rs 416.30 crore over 34 months and a paltry Rs 89 crore was paid out as part of the pyramid scheme to investors.
Saradha Realty India collected Rs 774.32 crore from 2008-09 to 2012-13. In 2010-11, it collected Rs 397 crore and repaid Rs 175 crore. The following year, collections fell significantly to Rs 174 crore, and consequently payments fell drastically to Rs 16 crore; in 2012-13, collection and repayments were reduced to Rs 88 crore and Rs 1.53 lakh respectively. These four companies had meagre income or revenue, if any, from their declared business activities as specified in their memorandum of association.
Explaining how the scam was constructed, the SFIO goes onto say that these companies could repay the money only from the fresh collections as they were not generating any significant revenue.
Paperwork was created to show the funds collected as having been put together for sale /transfer of land / flats / apartments or tour packages whereas the intention was always to refund the collected amount with interest on maturity only to some of the depositors and never to refund to the vast majority in the absence of any credible mode of generating a surplus-the characteristics and DNA of a pyramid scheme. Interestingly, Sen during the course of his deposition under oath also revealed that former West Bengal police chief Rajat Majumdar was appointed as a consultant at a salary of Rs 7 lakh per month. At Majumdar's insistence, Saradha agreed to become the prime sponsor of the Bishwa Banga Sammelan 2012 held in Las Vegas in the hope of getting business in the US. Close to Rs 4 crore was blown up on this jaunt.
In a startling revelation, the SFIO points out that Debabrata Sarkar alias Nitu, the de facto secretary of East Bengal Football Club, met Sen and took Rs 5 crore and close to Rs 70 lakh per month (from February 2011 to February 2013) to settle the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) matter. These payments were mostly in cash and if at all in cheque, then in the name of Revlon Commercials with whom Saradha had no trade dealing whatsoever.
While Sen in his statement claimed that this continued for four years (Rs 70 lakh per month is Rs 8.4 crore per year, or Rs 33.6 crore in four years), Debjani claims that this process lasted two years, "I heard from Sudipta that he was taking money for settlement with SEBI and Reserve Bank of India. (A total amount of approximately Rs 16-18 crore has been made available to Sarkar.) During Sarkar's questioning, he said that a MoU dated 23.6.2010 was entered into between East Bengal and Saradha for annual sponsorship of the football team at Rs 2 crore per year. East Bengal, he argued, received cheques totaling Rs 2 crore from Saradha, but some of them were dishonoured.
On the followup, Saradha paid the club Rs 1.51 crore during 2010-11. While he denied receiving any payments in favour of Revlon, he stated that the club received Rs 1.96 crore and Rs 0.61 crore during 2011-12 and 2012-13 respectively in the form of donations as sponsorship against logo used on the chest of the jersey.
Investigators also examined Kunal Jhunjhunwala, director of Revlon Commercial who said that Revlon had 16 transactions with Saradha Group companies for sale of textiles. Total quantum of transaction with Saradha was around Rs 2.46 crore, collecting payment in advance through cheques before delivery. The SFIO concludes by saying that the role played by this trinity-Debabrata Sarkar, Kunal Jhunjhunwala and Sudipta Sen- should be referred to the Central Bureau of Investigation.

PM s visit may boost India-Aus trade tiesDiaspora eyes boost to India-Australia ties post PM Narendra Modi's visit

Since migrating to Sydney from Mumbai in 2000, Praful Desai has maintained economic as well as family ties with his homeland by investing in real estate in Gujarat, the business-friendly state that grew in prominence under then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.
With Modi now prime minister, Desai, who works in advertising and is the vice president of the Council of Indian Australians Inc, says he has the confidence to invest elsewhere in the country.
The businessman is betting on the Prime Minister's upcoming visit to Australia to strengthen ties with the near 300,000-strong domestic diaspora in the country, with a friendly tax regime for non-residents and options for dual citizenship on the wish list.
"Expat Indians want to connect more with India," said Desai, adding, "Modi will probably give us an assurance that the India growth story is intact. That's the kind of thing people want to hear that will drive a lot of money back home."
Modi came to office in May after a landslide victory in the general elections, with a mandate to create jobs and kickstart the domestic economy after a long period of sluggish growth. The Prime Minister's signature ' Make in India ' and 'Clean India' initiatives include targeting expats for investment.
The 64-year-oil premier's popularity with non-resident Indians (NRIs) was underscored on a recent 5-day visit to the United States, where he received a rockstar reception and sold out Madison Square Garden.
Modi is expected to draw 16,000 people to his rally in Sydney on Monday, while 270 people have booked on the "Modi Express" train for fans, which will run from Melbourne to Sydney.
The Prime Minister is also expected to meet 200 prominent Indian businessmen and entrepreneurs and students in Sydney.
Modi "wants every Indian living in Australia to feel that their leader has come to meet them, he wants to know them and even seek their support for projects back home," a Foreign Ministry official said.
TRADE, INTELLIGENCE, SECURITY
The Prime Minister wants a more comprehensive security and intelligence dialogue with Australia, which is looking at teh country to buy more minerals in particular.
However, progress on trade has been slow, with Australian exports to the country falling 22 per cent in 2013 to A$12 billion ($10.2 billion). That's a far cry from Australia's A$150 billion two-way trade with China and the A$40 billion goal by 2015 set two years ago by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard.
Although, a recently sealed civil nuclear deal to sell uranium to the country is seen as a sign of growing trust between the two nations, along with PM Modi's visit, the first by an Indian leader since 1986.
"Exports have fallen but expectations are that this will bounce back," said Rory Medcalf, senior research fellow on India Strategic Affairs at the University of New South Wales.
"The India-Australia relationship is reaching a new maturity and it's reaching a tipping point where it will become a much more comprehensive and trusting relationship."
After Australia, teh Prime Minister is due to visit Fiji, which has a large ethnic Indian community.

Wal-Mart encouraged by sales increase but only cautiously optimistic for the holiday seasonBy Sarah Halzack November 13 Follow @sarahhalzack

Wal-Mart said Wednesday that sales at its U.S. stores increased for the first time in seven quarters, but executives say they are only cautiously optimistic as the retailer gears up for the crucial holiday season.
The company said it likely got a lift in the third quarter from lower gas prices, which helped free up disposable income for consumers who might otherwise be cash-strapped. Wal-Mart also said seasonal events such as back-to-school and Halloween helped sales.
But while low gas prices are expected to remain a tailwind for Wal-Mart and other retailers through the holiday season, Wal-Mart said it expects to face other key challenges. Once again, promotional pricing will make for a fiercely competitive environment, and executives said a lack of must-have electronics items this year could create drag during a quarter when the entertainment category typically makes up a large share of its sales.
With those factors in mind, Wal-Mart is forecasting flat to 1 percent growth for the fourth quarter.
Wal-Mart U.S. chief executive Greg Foran said the big-box retailer still has “a lot of work to do” to improve its business, which is facing mounting pressure from e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com.  While the uptick in sales at U.S. stores was a welcome reversal from the sagging sales seen in recent quarters, the increase was relatively small–just 0.5 percent.  Foot traffic at Wal-Mart U.S. stores also declined 0.7 percent in the quarter.
Wal-Mart has announced a variety of measures that it hopes will help it outdo rivals this holiday season.  The company is offering five days of Black Friday deals, and it has already begun trying to lure holiday shoppers with a price rollback on 20,000 items that went into effect on Nov. 1.  On Wednesday, the big-box retailer confirmed that it would offer price-matching on items from Amazon.com and other online retailers this holiday season, a policy that has been informally practiced by some store managers.
Wal-Mart said earlier this year that its growth strategy going forward will increasingly focus on its e-commerce business and its small-format Neighborhood Markets stores.  Global e-commerce sales grew 21 percent in the quarter; the company does not disclose what share of its overall sales comprise online purchases.
Wal-Mart saw stronger sales growth at its fleet of Neighborhood Market stores, which range in size from 12,000 to 43,000 square feet.  Sales at stores open more than a year increased a healthy 5.5 percent.   The company said pharmacy and packaged food have been the greatest contributors to that growth, but other categories have been relatively weak.
“I’m not happy that we’re doing as a good a job as we need to across the fresh foods,” Foran said in a conference call with reporters.
Wal-Mart plans to open more than 170 Neighborhood Markets in the fourth quarter.  With their smaller footprints, the Neighborhood Markets allow the world’s largest retailer to move deeper into urban neighborhoods and other new markets.

Nehru’s vision was liberal, democratic and aimed at consolidation of united India, says Sonia
Launching a sharp attack on the Narendra Modi government, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said his administration was an entity “operated by angry men” and “led by communal forces.”
The government’s objective, she charged at a Congress function to commemorate the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru here, was to “destroy his [Nehru’s] legacy” by targeting the secular fabric of India.
“His [Nehru’s] vision was liberal, democratic and aimed at the creation and consolidation of a united India,” Ms. Gandhi said while addressing thousands of Congress activists at the Talkatora stadium.
“But the very idea of India that Pandit Nehru had in his heart and even succeeded in forging in just 17 years as its Prime Minister is now under attack. Every Congress worker must unite and ensure that we fight all those divisive forces, bearing different colours and hues, tooth and nail to preserve the secular ideology that was Nehru's and was Nehru himself,” Ms. Gandhi said, invoking Nehruvian Nationalism.
“There is perhaps no field that he did not contribute to, no problem of the country that he did not try to find a solution for given his tremendous energy which aimed to forge a new united nation,” Ms. Gandhi.
Nehru’s contributions
Earlier, speaking at the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru at the Talkatora Stadium here, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said: “There is perhaps no field that he did not contribute to, no problem of the country that he did not try to find a solution for given his tremendous energy which aimed to forge a new united nation,” Ms. Gandhi said. “If it wasn’t for him, it wouldn’t have been possible to launch the Chandrayaan and Mangalyan in space,” she added.
In his address, Mr. Rahul Gandhi alleged: “Today, the angry people who run the country want to ban English to promote Hindi.”
“On the one hand, they pick up brooms so that they can have photo-ops while on the other they spread venom in the form of communal hatred. Only the Congress can fight and defeat the hatemongers running the country these days,” he added.
Both his mother and Mr. Gandhi accepted that the 129-year-old Congress was currently facing a crisis but insisted that the grand old party would bounce back.
“If he [Nehru] was alive, he would have asked us to go to the people, to establish a better connection with them and to strengthen the organisation. But let our critics know that our party has existed for over a hundred years and will continue to since we take inspiration from our forefathers,” Ms. Gandhi said.

Inverted equal protection: same-sex marriage at the Sixth Circuit (Part I)By Dale Carpenter November 14
Judge Jeffrey Sutton’s opinion for the Sixth Circuit in DeBoer v. Snyder last week rejected constitutional claims for same-sex marriage on several grounds. Briefly, the Sixth Circuit concluded: (1) the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment doesn’t encompass a constitutional claim for same-sex marriage; (2) states have a rational basis for laws recognizing opposite-sex marriages; (3) there’s no unconstitutional animus in laws banning same-sex marriages; (4) there’s no fundamental right to marry a person of the same sex; and (5) heightened scrutiny doesn’t apply to laws banning gay couples from marriage. (Sutton also dispatches an argument based on the constitutional right to travel in a few paragraphs.)
Yesterday I responded in part to what I see as the Sixth Circuit’s inadequate understanding of the animus doctrine , which springs from core equal-protection concerns. The presence of animus in restrictions on same-sex marriage takes anti-SSM constitutional amendments, mini-DOMA laws, and state statutory limitations out of ordinary rational-basis review.
But there are several other equal-protection principles at stake in DeBoer. These touch on (1) the place of original meaning in interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, (2) the methodology of rational-basis review in equal-protection cases, and (3) the appropriate level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause for same-sex marriage exclusions.  (I don’t plan to address the due process fundamental-right argument. I also don’t plan to address the Sixth Circuit’s failure even to mention the argument that denying a person the ability to choose the sex of his spouse is sex discrimination, an omission Ilya has criticized .)
The upshot is that, even apart from its equal-protection  errors in applying animus doctrine , the Sixth Circuit failed to follow far more familiar and accepted equal-protection analysis. The DeBoer decision starts off with an unusually limited version of original-meaning methodology for an equal-protection case, then asks the opposite of the right question under rational-basis review, and finally turns the usual approach to suspect-classification analysis on its head. The result is a curiously inverted equal-protection approach to same-sex marriage.
This post responds specifically to the Sixth Circuit’s use of original meaning against a claim for same-sex marriage. In separate subsequent posts, I plan to address the rational basis and suspect-classification issues.
I.  Specific-intentions originalism under the Equal Protection Clause
The Sixth Circuit starts with the broadly accepted proposition that original meaning helps to guide constitutional interpretation in many cases.  The opinion supports this proposition with a string citation to the following cases: Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 173–80 (1803) (congressional and judicial power); McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 401–25 (1819) (same); Legal Tender Cases, 79 U.S. 457, 536–38 (1870) (paper money); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 110–39 (1926) (executive power); INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944–59 (1983) (separation of powers); Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 218–25 (1995) (separation of powers); Washington v. Glucksburg, 521 U.S. 702, 710–19 (1997) (substantive due process); Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 42–50 (2004) (Confrontation Clause); Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 739–46 (2008) (executive power); Giles v. California, 554 U.S. 353, 358–61 (2008) (admissibility of hearsay); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 576–600 (2008) (Second Amendment). Elsewhere in the original-meaning discussion, the opinion cites an Establishment Clause case and the recent Recess Appointments Clause case. All of these decisions show, argues Judge Sutton, that original meaning cabins and directs the application of open-ended constitutional clauses.
Notice the absence of equal-protection cases on that list. That’s not an accident or an error of omission. It’s hard to find any prominent equal-protection cases in which the specific views of the Civil War-era framers and ratifiers, to the extent they could even be known, determined the outcome. In fact, the modern decisions dealing with public-school racial segregation, interracial marriage, and sex discrimination have eluded the best efforts of scholars and historians to justify them under a narrow approach to original meaning. They would probably have to come out the other way if the narrow approach prevailed. No wonder the limited version of originalist methodology played no role in the decisions.
I call this narrow method specific-intentions originalism, but it’s sometimes called original-expected-application originalism. I wouldn’t argue that specific-intentions originalism has never been used or that it’s inappropriate in all cases to use it. Indeed, some of the cases Judge Sutton cites are exemplars of the method. But the spacious words of the Equal Protection Clause, the larger principles it enshrines, and the extensive history of its doctrinal development have ruled out specific-intentions originalism as the appropriate guide to understanding it.
So it’s correct but hardly dispositive that, in the words of DeBoer, “nobody argues” that “the people who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage” to include same-sex couples. At one time, it was not thought to deny equal protection to make “colored persons” and whites sit in separate rail cars. It was widely thought that there was no constitutional problem with physically separating white and black schoolchildren as long as the books, desks, buildings, and teachers were the same in quality (in practice, they never were). It was the law of all but nine states long after the Civil War ended to refuse marriage licenses to interracial couples.
It was nothing to prohibit women from practicing law, tending bar, or attending military academies because their “paramount destiny” was to be good wives and raise children. In fact, it was “the law of the Creator,” declared Justice Bradley.  How could the Constitution possibly be understood to contradict that? Nobody seriously thinks that “the people who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment understood it to require the States” to dismantle the patriarchy. The Equal Protection Clause (like free-speech doctrine) is an embarrassment to specific-intentions originalism.
II.  Principles-based originalism under the Equal Protection Clause
The text and doctrine support constitutional protection to “any person” (not any particular racial group or gender or other class). They do not support the practice of hewing closely to what the framers and ratifiers might have thought about a particular issue had they contemplated it. Like many originalists themselves, including Judge Robert Bork in The Tempting of America, the Court’s equal-protection cases have adopted an approach to original meaning quite different from the Sixth Circuit’s specific-intentions version of it. Call it principles-based originalism.
Principles-based originalism has been used in equal-protection doctrine to enforce the larger principles embodied in the text–like abolishing caste-creating laws and prohibiting discrimination against a group for invidious reasons unrelated to their own merits, that is, failing to treat them like “any person” who possesses equal worth and dignity. The Equal Protection Clause is a self-conscious repudiation of exclusion and hierarchy supported by nothing more than ancient practice. It demands reasons. And what counts as legitimate and sufficiently rational reasons evolves over time, as it has in every area of equal protection. How to reconcile the need to resist “anything goes” in equal-protection cases with the doctrine’s undoubted reliance on a broader principles-based originalism is a genuine problem. But DeBoer does not even acknowledge, much less grapple with it.
In fact, there are originalist-oriented arguments in favor of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage,  as Ilya notes , including a  recent article  by Federalist Society co-founder Steve Calabresi. I don’t evaluate those arguments here, although suffice it to say that originalist arguments can be used plausibly and have been used in fact to reach results that would never have been anticipated by the authors of the amendment. Judge Sutton’s opinion simply does not engage the issue at the level of originalist principle. His originalist analysis is incomplete and selective.
III.  Originalism and homosexuality under the Equal Protection Clause
What might a principles-based originalism have to say about the law’s historic discrimination against homosexuals? A principles-based originalism leaves room for the possibility that we may learn from experience and systematic study that laws once thought necessary and proper serve only to needlessly oppress. Classes of people long thought to be sick, maladjusted, predatory, disease-ridden sub-human filth (you should read some of the emails I still get) may be discovered living out their lives next to us, working beside us, raising families, and committing themselves to each other, their children, and their communities. Who knew?
It was once thought entirely rational do anything we wanted to homosexuals as a way to serve the legitimate and even compelling goal of preserving traditional morality and good social order: firing them from government jobs; denying them security clearances; discharging them from military service without regard to valor and self-sacrifice; subjecting them to chemical castration, electro-shock therapy, and psychological “cures”; prosecuting them for sexual intimacy; denying them custody and visitation with their own children; keeping them from being buried together in veterans’ cemeteries; slamming the door to a loved one’s hospital room; and excluding them from even attending a partner’s funeral.
Indeed, Colorado never doubted that it could strip them, and them alone, of all civil-rights protections. Texas thought it could make only their “deviate sex” a crime. Congress could surely deny any recognition to their marriages alone among all the second and third and faithless and childless and prisoner and deadbeat-parent marriages it didn’t hesitate to recognize. From the moment homosexuals and others around them realized who they were to the moment they died the law knew no limits in its obsessive quest to punish and harass them.
Now high-profile opponents of gay marriage at the Supreme Court can’t think of a single instance in which it would even be rational for government to discriminate against them–except for denying them marriage licenses, of course.  The issue is not, as DeBoer conceives it, a matter of elite courts imposing new and evanescent views on the Constitution. It is a matter of reconciling the thinly justified practice and hesitation of 31 states with a constitutional principle of equal protection that–understood in light of decades of experience, systematic study, and understanding–accommodates no legitimate anti-gay discrimination in any other area of the law. Marriage exclusions are the last legal redoubt of perceived homosexual inadequacy.
Parts of the Sixth Circuit opinion frankly acknowledge the errors of the past. Parts might just as easily fit in an opinion striking down the marriage laws of Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, and Michigan. This is a court admirably unburdened by anti-gay hysteria and misconceptions, self-conscious in its desire to avoid even a hint of long-discarded prejudices. Even on the touchiest of issues, marriage and children, Judge Sutton is stunningly confident (and right):
Gay couples, no less than straight couples, are capable of sharing such [committed] relationships. And gay couples, no less than straight couples, are capable of raising children and providing stable families for them. The quality of such relationships, and the capacity to raise children within them, turns not on sexual orientation but on individual choices and individual commitment.
That statement would have been literally incomprehensible in 1868 (when the modern concept of homosexuality did not exist and “gay” still meant cheerful), would have been shocking to most people in 1968 (when two-thirds of Americans told pollsters they viewed homosexuals with “disgust, discomfort, or fear”), and remains controversial in some gatherings even today (when some sociology professors still testify against gay parenting).
Yet Judge Sutton does not even feel the need to cite a single study to support the view that it’s commitment, not sexual orientation, that matters in relationships and child-rearing. What a remarkable, rather matter-of-fact claim for a court that in the same breath treats constitutional rights as if they were set in stone by men who lived 150 years ago, never to be enforced beyond their narrow understanding by anyone but the very state legislators they distrusted.
The Sixth Circuit fully agrees that the earth has moved under our feet on the subjects of homosexuality, same-sex relationships, and gay parenting. What a shame that it does not honor the framers of the amendment by acknowledging that they might have had the insight to know that their own human understanding might be fallible. They might even have had the humility to accept that when it comes to subjects they could never have imagined, their descendants would be the ancients, not the framers themselves.
And how regrettable it is that the Sixth Circuit failed to respect the framers’ fear that a state legislature might continue to “deny to any person the equal protection of the laws” even after the foundation underlying that denial was so obviously wrong that a respected conservative jurist needs no real argument or evidence to rebut it. The framers’ amendment left open the possibility of securing equal protection not only in legislative processes but in courts exercising the acknowledged power of judicial review. The refusal to appreciate that now on the subject of same-sex marriage is not to honor the original design, but to abandon it.

Apple's Irish tax deal may be state aid, says Europe
The European Commission is not convinced Apple is paying a fair rate of tax on what it sells
Is Apple's tax avoidance rational?
The European Commission (EC) has told Ireland it believes it gave illegal state aid to Apple.
It has published a letter, originally sent to the country in June, accusing it of helping the computer giant through special tax arrangements.
The EC is looking at whether some countries, including Luxembourg and the Netherlands, unfairly favour multinationals.
Apple says it has received "no selective treatment".
The company employs more than 4,000 people in the Republic of Ireland, mainly assembling computers and providing technical support.
Ireland's corporate tax rate is set at 12.5%, but Apple enjoys an effective rate of tax of 2%, due to the way it channels overseas sales through its subsidiaries.
Repayment
Continue reading the main story
“Start Quote
Apple... paid just £11.4 million in corporation tax in 2013 after declaring UK revenues of just £100m. Given the company has 37 UK stores, and the average Apple store took over £30 million last year, you can see how much of that revenue is being diverted through Ireland”

In a statement, the company said: "Our success in Europe and around the world is the result of hard work and innovation by our employees, not any special arrangements with the government.
"Apple has received no selective treatment from Irish officials over the years. We're subject to the same tax laws as the countless other companies who do business in Ireland."
It goes on to say, though, that it believes "comprehensive corporate tax reform is badly needed".
As well as Apple, Fiat and Starbucks are also in the EC's sights.
The Commission told Fiat on Tuesday its preliminary view was that its tax arrangement with a subsidiary of Fiat also constituted state aid. Fiat has not yet commented.
The Commission said it appeared it had the effect of reducing the charges Fiat would normally pay "and that it must consequently be considered as operating aid".
If either company is found to have benefitted from illegal state aid, it will have to repay any tax benefit it received.
There is a wide range of estimates as to the sum that Apple would have to repay - anything between a few tens of millions to billions of euros.
'No breach'
In the letter, the European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told Ireland: "The Commission's preliminary view is that the tax ruling of 1990 (effectively agreed in 1991) and of 2007 in favour of the Apple group constitute state aid."
Ireland's Department of Finance said in a statement earlier this week: "Ireland is confident that there is no breach of state aid rules in this case and has already issued a formal response to the Commission earlier this month, addressing in detail the concerns and some misunderstandings contained in the opening decision,"
Ireland's flexible approach to tax is designed to attract investment and jobs to the country. But other European countries say their treasuries lose out, as corporations funnel profits through Irish registered companies that are not resident for tax anywhere.
The EU's move comes as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development begins a broader crackdown on aggressive tax avoidance by multinational companies.

PM Modi reaches Australia  may raise black money issue at G20 meetModi may raise black money issue at G20 meet
PTI  Brisbane, November 14, 2014
First Published: 12:40 IST(14/11/2014) | Last Updated: 17:28 IST(14/11/2014)
As India's attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad continues, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will push for stepping up global cooperation against the key issue of cross border tax avoidance and evasion at the G20 summit starting on Saturday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives at the Brisbane G20 Terminal in Australia. (Reuters Photo)
Modi, who is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, arrived in Brisbane on a five-day trip to Australia on the second leg of his 10-day three-nation tour.
He will also undertake a bilateral visit to the Australian capital Canberra for talks with Premier Tony Abbott on Tuesday.
The Prime Minister will also utilise the two-day 9th G20 summit of the world's biggest developed and emerging economies, to flag India's concerns over "jobless growth" prospects.
Ahead of the summit, Modi felt that focusing on transforming the quality of life of people and not just on issues like the health of the financial markets was necessary for creating employment-generating economic growth.
It was a bright and sunny day at Brisbane as Modi stepped out of his Special Air India plane at the international airport after an overnight flight from Myanmar capital Nay Phi Taw where he attended two back-to-back international summits and had a string of bilateral meetings.
"Reached Brisbane. It is bright and sunny outside," Modi tweeted.
Modi was received at the airport by the Queensland Premier Campbell Newman among others. Indian High Commissioner in Australia Biren Nanda was also present.
"A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money," Modi had said, as he is set to renew the country's commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
Modi had also said he intends to discuss how G20 can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The G20 includes 19 individual countries -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the US -- and the European Union (EU).
Collectively, the G20 economies account for around 85% of the GDP, 80% of world trade and two-thirds of the world population. The G20 was launched in 2008 in the US.
Jobs and growth will remain the focus of the G20 summit, despite strenuous lobbying to shift the spotlight to climate change and Ebola.
Australia, which holds the G20 presidency, on Friday re-emphasised the summit's mission when Treasurer Joe Hockey stressed the heavy burden on group members "to get real outcomes".
"We have a plan before the leaders of the world to grow the world economy, to create the jobs that are necessary, to lift people out of poverty, and we are determined to deliver that," he said.
On the table is Australia's call for the G20 to collectively add at least two per cent to world growth to 2018. If successful, this could generate millions of jobs, massive infrastructure activity and cut red tape.
G20 countries have also produced 1,000 plans to support the growth target.
Modi, referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney besides Canberra, had earlier said, "While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential."
"A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India's economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood," he said.
Indian officials said that the prime minister's trip will be a "landmark visit" and is aimed at "re-engaging" Australia.
Prime Minister Abbott had a telephonic talk with Modi before his departure from India to discuss the agenda for the multilateral meeting and he asked the Indian leader to share, in particular, his vision for accelerating global economic growth and employment generation.
Abbott conveyed that he and the Australian people were keenly awaiting the visit of Modi, who appreciated his personal attention to his visit and emphasised the importance he attached to his Australia visit as a step towards qualitatively transforming a relationship that he greatly values.
Abbott also sought Modi's support for Australia's infrastructure initiatives in the G20.
On his part, Modi thanked Abbott for his leadership in developing a meaningful agenda for the G20 Summit and expressed confidence that it would be one of the most memorable G20 Summits, which will impart new momentum to the global economy.
Modi also suggested that, in addition to facilitating financial flows for infrastructure financing, there was a need to look at innovative mechanisms for infrastructure development, including research on transforming waste into infrastructure inputs.
During the telephonic conversation, Modi also talked about creating a virtual centre for information exchange, guidance, identifying opportunities and facilitating flows, which would be beneficial to the poor countries as well.
Modi and Abbott had summit talks in Delhi last month during which India and Australia sealed a civil nuclear deal.
On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Modi is due to hold a series of bilateral meetings including with Germany's Angela Merkel, UK's David Cameron and France's Francois Hollande.
Modi will also have an informal interaction with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting of leaders of five-nation BRICS.
Modi has already met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday in Nay Phi Taw. Modi is also due to address a joint sitting of Federal Parliament in Canberra and the Indian community at a reception at the Olympic park in Sydney.
Modi will travel to Fiji on a day-long visit on November 19 before returning home the next day. He will be the first Indian Premier to visit the south Pacific Island nation after a gap of 33 years, the first being Indira Gandhi in 1981.

Reuters Breakingviews columnSave
“Shareholder value maximisation” belongs in the trash heap of economic history. The fact that it is still popular needs some explanation.
What’s wrong with the idea that companies should be run exclusively to maximise the short-term gains of equity investors? Pretty much everything, as work by academics such as Hugh Willmott, Jeroen Veldman, Lynn Stout, Paddy Ireland and John Kay shows.
First, shareholders don’t deserve special treatment. They are just one contributor to corporate success – and this contribution becomes less important over time.
Second, the idea that they own companies is an oversimplification. Boards are actually supposed to promote the firm’s overall good over the long haul.
Third, they are poorly placed to steer the company’s future. Most are legally barred from acquiring the inside information needed for informed decisions.
Fourth, this single-minded focus produces awful results. Not just scandals and collapses like Enron or Lehman Brothers, but smaller disgraces like factories closed at a moment’s notice, or R&D programmes shuttered so buybacks and dividends can be maintained.
Some high priests of shareholder value, like former General Electric boss Jack Welch, have recanted. And the ethos never took hold as firmly in, say, Germany, as it did in Anglo-Saxon boardrooms. But the idea has remained remarkably resilient. Why?
There’s an easy, cynical answer. Exorbitantly paid investors and executives do not see enough of the real world to care much about how their pursuit of shareholder value could affect it. Pay awards tied to shareholder returns serve as an incentive not to think critically.
But the idea could not have got so far and stayed powerful for so long if it didn’t seem plausible to many people.
One mistake is to assume economic actors always act to “maximise” something – for companies, profits. In fact, life is much more complicated. John Kay is onto something when he says that companies actually have to optimise, or try to get the most of many different goods.
However, I think the fundamental issue is even deeper: an excessively financial, numerical view of economic purpose. This is what I call the “ultimate money illusion”: treating money as worthy of veneration.
Of course, money, finance and profits are all crucial tools in the modern economy. Companies work in the cash economy and investors will always measure their returns. However, companies, especially large ones, are not simple profit-machines. They are multifaceted human endeavours, like the family, church, school, army or nation.
The corporate goal is to be good at all of the many things that companies do. The list is long. They should offer quality and value to customers, a good deal to suppliers and workers, care for the environment, loyalty to many different communities, fair returns for investors, respect for the past and a commitment to the future. They should be honourable and imaginative, reliable and humane.
Some of these things can be priced more or less accurately in monetary terms, but for most of them it is foolish to try. An estimated dollar value of virtue or loyalty will inevitably add more confusion than insight. And the reliance on any simply monetary definition of corporate success, no matter how complex the maths behind it, will often degrade behaviour.
For example, a purely financial calculation might conclude that cash payments to shareholders offer a higher “risk-adjusted return” than wage increases or investments in new technology. For an apostle of shareholder value, the argument ends there. But high payouts to shareholders put the company on a path that is likely to stimulate popular hostility and unlikely to lead to long-term success.
It is possible to come up with a different answer by tweaking the calculations. Just put a higher value on profits a few decades hence or raise the expected return on new investments. But the use of numbers just confuses the analysis. It is better to move beyond the dollar values and pay more careful attention to some necessarily non-countable factors: the enduring responsibility to workers, the nation and the future.
Corporate communities can be a powerful force for promoting the common good. After all, companies are more flexible than monolithic governments and more professional and powerful than scattered individuals. However, if managers and boards focus too much on getting the numbers right, particularly for the next few quarters, the potential will be squandered.
Shareholder value is a particularly pernicious version of the ultimate money illusion. But it is far from the only one. As long as everything economic is discussed primarily in monetary terms, there can be little respect for some of the finest attributes of the modern economic arrangement, including the flexible, effective and reasonably just modern corporation.

(The initiatives are two…)
NEW DELHI: Tata Sons Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata has been appointed to the board of Interpol Foundation to contribute to its two new global initiatives aimed at combating organised crime and terrorist activities by the international police organisation.
Tata will be in the company of HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver, Credit Agricole Chairman Jean-Marie Sander, Abraaj Capital Chairman and CEO Arif Naqvi and Renault-Nissan Alliance Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn -- the other members of the board, which is headed by Prince Albert II of Monaco and ex-Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister Elias Murr.
Interpol Foundation said it is "honoured that Tata Sons Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata has accepted to sit on its board of trustee and contribute to the success of the Protecting Cultural Property and Modernising Channels of International Judicial Cooperation initiatives."
The initiatives are two of the five global initiatives backed by Interpol and aimed at combating organised crime and terrorist activities, the foundation said in a statement.
The other initiatives taken up by the foundation are I-Chekit -- for protecting airlines hotels and banks from threats of identity fraud headed by Murr; protecting banks and financial institutions led by Naqvi; and INVEX -- fight against transnational vehicle crime and theft headed by Ghosn.
"Other initiatives will be announced in 2015 and entrusted to other members of the Board of Trustees," Interpol Foundation said.

Maharashtra: HC stays quotas for Marathas  Fadnavis to approach SCHC stays reservation for Marathas in jobs, education
Kanchan Chaudhari , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 14, 2014
First Published: 13:05 IST(14/11/2014) | Last Updated: 01:50 IST(15/11/2014)
Comments
The Bombay high court on Friday stayed the implementation of the state government’s decision to provide 16% quota in government jobs and educational institutes for the Maratha community.
The division bench of chief justice Mohit Shah and justice MS Sonak also stayed the 5% reservation for 50 Muslim communities in public employment, but allowed them to avail of the quota in educational institutes run and aided by the government.
The state government, however, has decided to challenge this decision in the Supreme Court, with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis saying he will take all possible steps to remove the stay on the Maratha reservation. While he did not comment on reservation for Muslims, the BJP has been opposed to it.
While hearing a bunch of public interest litigations, challenging the June 25 decision of the previous Congress-NCP cabinet, the bench concluded it was not up to the state to treat the Maratha community as a ‘backward class’.
“Rather, the National Commission for Backward Classes and the Mandal Commission has concluded the Marathas are a socially-advanced and prestigious community,” the court said, citing the findings of the Mandal Commission (1990), the National Commission for Backward Classes in February 2000 and a July 2008 report of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (Bapat Commission).
The bench noted several flaws in the report of the Narayan Rane Committee that had recommended the inclusion of the Maratha community in the socially- and economically-backward class, and which forms the basis of the 16 % reservation in favour of the community. The bench observed that the Rane committee did not refer to important rulings of the Supreme Court and findings of other commissions.
Further, constitutional benches of the Apex Court have laid down a law that the percentage of reservation for public employment cannot exceed 50%, the bench said, adding that the state did not have the power to breach that ceiling limit.
However, while refusing to stay the 5% reservation in education for backward Muslims, the bench said the material the state had relied on, to determine the backwardness of these 50 communities, makes a case for the existence of an extraordinary situation. “The material suggests the dire necessity to draw youth belonging to these communities to secular education,” the bench observed. “The material refers to an abysmally-low level of educational achievement, which ails the community, and a high dropout rate.”
Fadnavis has called for a meeting of group leaders of all political parties on Saturday morning. “The state is fully supportive of the Maratha reservation. We will appeal in SC. We will take measures to ensure that the quota remains. We will amend the existing law,” the CM told mediapersons.
Congress leader and former-CM Prithviraj Chavan, under whose leadership the quota was passed early this year, said his party would cooperate with the government to represent its case in the Apex Court. “The Congress will study the interim ruling and discuss it with legal experts. We will also check if the Congress can be a party to the petition,” he said.
 
‘NOT A BACKWARD COMMUNITY’
Commenting on the status of Marathas, the court observed, “Early historical and social documentation suggests that although Marathas originated from the Kunbi (farmers) caste, from the 14th century onwards, they evolved into a separate community with high social, educational and political status.”

Profits at Shoreditch darling Mandy Candy plunged into the red in 2013, with the company recording a £2.2m loss for the full-year 2013, compared with profits of £8m for 2012.
During the same period revenue at the company - which has brought the world kiddy virtual-playland Moshi Monsters - fell by more than one-third to £22.19m, according to its latest filing to Companies House.
Mind Candy's highest paid director was paid £200,000 for 2013, down from £402,083 in 2012.
In January, Mind Candy founder Michael Acton Smith was awarded an OBE - one rank lower than Warren East, former head of chip designer ARM, who received a CBE.
Mind Candy said it had launched multiple apps during 2013, but added: "While download numbers have been strong, we have yet to find a commercial model that works at scale. Creating commercially successful mobile products in the highly competitive app store has proved extremely difficult."
It said: "2013 has been a year of transition and investment for the future for Mind Candy," said the company in a statement. "Touchscreen devices are now a much more popular way for children to consume entertainment than websites."
The accounts also reveal the company took out a loan of $10m (£6.4m) in June 2014, which will be repayable in June 2017. A further $10m is also due to be made available to it next year. ®

Iraqi forces drive Islamic State from refinery town ofBeijiPrint
By: Associated Press | Bhagdad | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:08 pm
Two Iraqi security officials say that government forces have driven out Islamic State militants from the entire oil refinery town of Beiji, north of Baghdad.
The officials say that Iraqi troops on Friday also lifted the Islamic State group’s siege of the oil refinery, Iraq’s largest.
The officials, reached by phone in Beiji, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to media.
Iraqi state TV also reported the “liberation of Beiji”, quoting the top army commander there, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi.
Islamic State extremists captured Beiji during their summer blitz across north and western Iraq. The Iraqi forces had collapsed in the face of that onslaught but have since partially regrouped and went on the offensive, with Beiji the biggest locality they have recaptured to date.

Mizoram Assembly adopts resolution condemning racist attacks on people from NorthEastPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: November 14, 2014 4:50 pm
The Mizoram Assembly on Friday unanimously adopted a resolution condemning racist attacks on people from the North East and offered its condolences to victims’ families. The resolution also expressed hope that such racist attacks do not happen in future.
Mizo National front MLA Lalruatkima, who moved the resolution, made an emphatic plea for an unanimous adoption, saying in his speech, “India is a country populated by various races — Aryans, Dravidians and Mongoloid. Sometimes there is conflict because of our different religious beliefs and cultural backgrounds.
“But even 67 years after Independence, people from the North East have been discriminated against because of the color of our skin, the build of our bodies and even the slant of our eyes. These have even resulted in deaths recently, and we in the North East are deeply hurt by these incidents. North East people have to sometimes work and study outside the region, and there we are discriminated against and even mocked because of our personalities and the kind of food we eat,” he said.
His fellow opposition MLA, Dr K Beichhua, seconded the resolution and said, “This is the time for us to fight for an anti-racism law because if we do not, our children and grandchildren will never forgive us for letting this historic moment slip by.”
Dr Beichhua narrated a story about a female friend who once completed her MBBS in Lucknow, saying, “She often tells me about her daily ordeal over five years as she commuted on a scooter to and from her residence to her college. She says, ‘I sometimes feel no more than an animal because as I ride, bystanders would throw all kinds of things, especially food, at me, even peels of fruits’.
“If these racist actions do not stop, how can we as parents with our children in cities in the mainland not always be filled with worry for their safety?” he asked.
Chalrosanga, a Congress MLA from one of Aizawl’s wealthiest families, also chipped in and said, “I studied in Delhi, and many times I was called a ‘chinky’, which obviously hurt,” before concluding in a lighter vein, “The only upside was that most people used to think all NE people know kung-fu so we hardly got ragged.”
Several Cabinet Ministers put their weight behind the opposition member’s resolution, with Home Minister R Lalzirliana saying, “The trouble is that as we are flowing into the mainstream, which is now irreversible, there are some who seem to object and create obstacles to this.
“If we can make some slight changes to this resolution, I think we should unanimously adopt it,” R Lalzirliana said, referring to several MLA’s contention that the resolution’s call for a strong anti-racism law might not be that effective given the various laws against violence in general already in place.
His colleague, Law Minister Lalsawta, told the house, “I think all of us might have experienced racial discrimination at one point or other in our lives. There is no denying racism still exists. But I wonder how effective it would be continued…
This is the time for us to fight for an anti-racism law because if we do not, our children and grandchildren will never forgive us for letting this historic moment slip by.

Akhilesh takes cue from Modi  will address school kids every monthPrint

Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to students on Teachers’ Day, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav will address school students every month through web telecast. The students’ parents would also be invited for the interactive session.
The secondary education department is making arrangements for the event, which would start from next month. It will be held in both government and private schools statewide.
“So what if it was done by PM Modi? We will do it even better. Ours will be more interactive and even parents will be invited, but it is not compulsory for them to attend…We will make it a monthly event in schools and students can interact with the CM. We will highlight our achievements and actions,” Mehboob Ali, the state’s Minister for Secondary Education, told The Indian Express.

The bank reported a net profit of Rs 3,100 crore in July-September quarter, up 30 per cent, from Rs 2,375 crore, in year ago period.
Net interest income was up 8.3 per cent at Rs 13,274 crore from Rs 12,251 crore, in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.
The bank's gross NPA slipped to 4.89 per cent vs 4.9 per cent while net NPA increased to 2.73 per cent vs 2.66 per cent, QoQ. Fresh slippages stood at Rs 7,700 crore from Rs 9,932 crore, QoQ.
The bank made bad loan provisions of Rs 4,030 crore vs Rs 3,903 crore, QoQ.
"The bigger picture is on the asset quality front. I will like to mention that asset quality numbers which you are seeing are a marginal blip and that should be fine. That is not a much bigger worry. Last quarter, it was Rs 604 billion of gross NPAs and this quarter, it is Rs 607. So it is flattish kind of number. So, not much a worry on that front," said Darpin Shah, Asst Vice President, Institutional Research, HDFC Securities.
He is bullish on the stock given the bank's liability franchise and lower impaired assets. The stock remains his preferred pick in the banking sector.
"Specifically slippages continue to be Rs 8,500 crore to Rs 9,000 crore, given the headline number is stable on sequential basis. The asset quality seems to be stable this quarter," said Manish Ostwal, Senior Research Analyst, KR Choksey Securities.
According to him, SBI continues to remain a 'Buy' after second quarter results
"We do not find any reason to revise our recommendation on the stock. The pecking order will be SBI, Bank of Baroda and Union Bank ," he added.
The PAT, NII and NPA are quite okay and the NPAs are pretty stable, says Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher.
In an interview to ET Now, he said, "the PSU banks may languish for a quarter but three-four PSU banks, over next six to nine months, will deliver much better performance because they will go in for a good amount of re-rating."
The stock ended at Rs 2,788.45, up 2.55 per cent, on the BSE. It rallied 3.21 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 2,806.45.

In a reflection of the exceptionally warm and friendly equations they share, Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe hosted a dinner for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Brisbane on Friday.
Both Modi and Abe are in Brisbane to take part in the G20 Summit starting on Saturday.
The scope for further strengthening economic ties between the two countries was discussed by the two leaders at the dinner hosted by Abe at the hotel he is staying in this Australian city.
“Happy to meet you once again,” Modi told Abe during their dinner meeting.
Warmth, mutual admiration and convergence of views had marked the meeting between Modi and Abe during the Prime Minister’s recent visit to Japan.
Abe had also hosted a dinner for Modi at the Imperial Guest House in Kyoto during his five—day visit to Japan.
During the Prime Minister’s visit, Japan had promised to invest USD 35 billion over five years in infrastructure projects in India, including building of smart cities and cleanup of the Ganga river.

BBC Scotland understands.Craig Whyte arrest warrant issued
By Chris McLaughlin BBC Sport
Craig Whyte bought Rangers for £1 from Sir David Murray
An arrest warrant has been issued for former Rangers owner Craig Whyte following an investigation into the club's sale in 2011.
Four other men detained during raids in England earlier have now been arrested.
David Grier, Paul Clark and David Whitehouse worked for Duff and Phelps, who were Rangers' administrators.
Gary Withey worked for law firm Collier Bristow, which represented Craig Whyte before he bought Rangers from Sir David Murray for £1 in 2011.
The four men were held during early morning raids at addresses across the UK in an operation that involved officers from Police Scotland, Surrey Police, Cheshire Police and Thames Valley Police.
Police Scotland have been investigating the sale of Rangers from Sir David Murray to Craig Whyte for more than a year.
'Ongoing investigation'
On Friday evening, a spokesman for Police Scotland said: "Following an operation on Friday 14 November, four men have been arrested and are presently detained in police custody in connection with the ongoing investigation into the alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers FC in 2011."
The men - two of them aged 50 and the others 49 and 53 - are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday.
Earlier, Duff and Phelps spokesman Marty Dauer said the firm was aware that three employees in the UK had been "detained for questioning in connection with work performed for Rangers Football Club".
He said this work "was commenced while these employees were part of MCR Partners, prior to its acquisition by Duff & Phelps in October of 2011".
He added: "Duff & Phelps has performed an internal investigation and commissioned an independent investigation of the related matters.
"As a result, we believe that our work for Rangers was conscientious, thorough and properly performed in every respect.
"Duff and Phelps has actively co-operated with all relevant investigating authorities throughout this process."
No wrongdoing
Mr Dauer said a subsequent review by the Insolvency Practitioners Association in 2013 had "cleared the firm of any wrongdoing or conflict of interest" over its involvement with Rangers.
Rangers manager Ally McCoist said: "Obviously I can't or wouldn't comment on a current police matter, but I would have to say I'm shocked.
"Obviously I can't pre-judge what is going to happen.
"Our concern has always been for the staff and supporters. What's happened to us in the last two-and-a-half, three years has been very tough, particularly on the staff and supporters.
"We just want to continue with our attempts to get the club back to where we feel we belong."
The developments are the latest twist in a three-year saga involving Rangers.
Mr Whyte bought Rangers from Sir David Murray for £1 in May 2011 and gave an undertaking to settle its £18m Lloyds Bank debt.
It later emerged he paid the debt by selling three years of season tickets to finance firm Ticketus for £25m.
Rangers entered administration on 14 February 2012, while under Mr Whyte's control, over non-payment of tax totalling about £14m.
Mr Clark and Mr Whitehouse from Duff and Phelps were appointed as joint administrators.
That resulted in Charles Green's consortium taking control and Rangers being accepted to play in the Scottish Third Division .
The administration and subsequent liquidation of Rangers resulted in Mr Whyte's deal with Ticketus being declared void. The finance firm successfully sued him for £18m over the failed deal.
Mr Whyte was later banned from being a company director for the maximum period of 15 years after a judge heard his conduct in dealing with Rangers was "shocking and reprehensible".

Why Warren Buffett Says He Bought Duracell(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)
Morning Money Memo…
Berkshire Hathaway, the firm run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, is buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble for nearly $3 billion.
“I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,” said Buffett. “Duracell is a leading global brand with top quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.”
(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images)
The deal was tax-efficient and a “classic Buffett” acquisition, said Greggory Warren, Morningstar analyst who covers Berkshire Hathaway.
“It’s a branded product,” Warren said. “The battery business, at the end of the day, is a commodity business in which consumers tend to be driven more by price than anything else. And it’s a capital-intensive business.”
P&G will receive shares of its own stock that are currently held by Berkshire Hathaway. Those shares are currently valued at about $4.7 billion.
P&G will contribute about $1.7 billion to Duracell as part of the deal.
“In doing the deal this way, they are literally swapping the stock for the asset, which doesn’t create a taxable event,” Warren said.
Private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Gillette paid $7 billion for Duracell in 1996.
 
Toy Company to Buy DreamWorks?
Shares of DreamWorks Animation SKG soared more than 20 percent after media reports that Hasbro is in talks to buy the studio.
The global toy company has been looking to expand its entertainment division, while DreamWorks has moved into consumer products.
“A combination of the two companies could accelerate efforts at each to move beyond their core businesses,” reported The Wall Street Journal.
 
Why We Shop Online
The impact of e-commerce is a growing challenge and opportunity for retailers. Walmart’s quarterly report – out today – said its global online sales soared 21 percent compared with last year.
Discounts and deals are not the top reason why most people shop online, according to new research.
“That’s actually quite surprising,” said Susan Lee, who follows retail price trends at the global consulting firm Simon-Kutcher. “Low prices were not one of the top three reasons across all the categories we studied.”
Convenience was found to be the top reason why so many people shop online, Lee said — “convenience of 24/7 shopping, shopping in your pajamas, shopping in between meetings and also avoiding the lines they would experience when they go into stores during the holiday season.”
 
 
SeaWorld Attendance Falls
Protests and allegations over poor treatment of orca whales hit profits and park attendance at SeaWorld Entertainment. The company’s share price dropped more than 9 percent after poor third-quarter results.
SeaWorld faced criticism from animal-rights groups and Blackfish, a documentary, over its use of killer whales in shows.
Approximately 8.4 million visitors went to SeaWorld parks during the summer quarter, about half a million less than last year.
“The decline resulted from a combination of factors, including negative media attention in California, along with the challenging competitive environment, particularly in Florida,” Chief Financial Officer James Heaney said on a conference call to investors, according to Bloomberg News.

Sun Pharma Q2 Profit Up 15%; Cipla Down on Slowing Exports
Reuters | Updated On: November 13, 2014 23:12 (IST)
Sensex, Nifty Trade Flat; Infosys Falls 4%
Mumbai: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, India's largest drugmaker by revenue, on Thursday posted a 15 per cent rise in quarterly net profit, roughly in line with expectations, helped by strong growth in sales in the domestic market.
Sun Pharma's smaller rival Cipla, however, reported a 16 per cent drop in its quarterly profit, hit by sluggish growth in income from exports, which accounts for more than half of its revenue.
India's $15 billion pharmaceutical industry makes more than half its sales in the United States, where a slowdown in new generic drug approvals is expected to weigh on sales of the local companies for at least couple of quarters.
Cipla's sales from export of finished drugs rose 0.4 per cent in the quarter to end-September from a year ago, while those from exports of drug ingredients fell 34 percent.
Cipla, India's fourth-largest drugmaker by revenue, posted profit of Rs 299 crore ($48.63 million) in the quarter to end-September, while analysts on average expected Rs 351crore, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Sun Pharma reported a profit of Rs 1,572 crore for the same quarter, nearly meeting estimates of Rs 1,588 crore.
Sun Pharma, in the process of acquiring rival drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories, said it was working on getting approvals for the deal from India and US antitrust regulators.
There may be "minor delays" in closing the deal if approvals do not come in time, Sun Pharma's Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi said in a post-earnings call with analysts. The company had earlier said it expected to close the deal by December.
Sun Pharma agreed in April to buy Ranbaxy for $3.2 billion, betting it could help Ranbaxy fix quality control issues that led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banning its India-based plants.
However, Sun Pharma has itself faced regulatory scrutiny recently. The FDA banned exports to the United States from its Karkhadi plant in western India in March due to its failure to maintain complete test data records and inadequate staff training.
On Thursday, Shanghvi said that during the quarter the FDA also inspected the company's Halol drug manufacturing plant in western India, and made certain "observations", and the company was taking corrective measures to fix the issues.

RBI to Remain Cautious Despite Drop in Inflation: Deputy GovernorRBI to Ease Rates by 0.5 Per Cent in 2015, First Cut Likely in February: Morgan Stanley
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank will continue to be on guard against the price rise as the recent fall in Consumer Price Index-based inflation may be due to a base effect, Deputy Governor S S Mundra said today.
"There is a base effect, we know. And the base effect in the coming months would not have the same impact as it is having today," Mr Mundra told a news channel here.
He was reacting to a question on the big decline in the CPI inflation at 5.52 per cent for October, which is much lower than the RBI's target of 8 per cent by January.
The RBI, which has been keeping rates at an elevated level citing the high inflation, wants to bring it down to 6 per cent by January 2016. It is scheduled to come out with its bi-monthly policy announcement on December 2.
The pro-growth economists and industrialists have been demanding rate cuts for quite some time.
Mr Mundra, who handles banking supervision, said the RBI has always adopted a cautious stance when it comes to managing inflation.
"We were always guarded (on inflation). RBI, as an organisation which has been given the responsibility of overseeing a large part of the financial sector, has to be on the guard always," he said.
"Base effects will also temper inflation in the next few months only to reverse towards the end of the year. The Reserve Bank will look through base effects," Governor Raghuram Rajan had said in his monetary policy announcement on September 30.
Mr Mundra said the RBI continues to be concerned over the accretion of non-performing assets and will be looking at the data to see if the restructured assets are slipping into NPAs.
He also expressed concern over the delay in the appointment of chiefs in six state-run banks, adding that the RBI has taken up the issue with the government, which has said it will be filling up the positions soon.

Cipla Edges Lower After Sluggish Exports Hit Earnings
Reuters | Updated On: November 14, 2014 10:08 (IST)
Shares in Cipla fells 0.4 per cent after July-September earnings. The drugmaker's Q2 profit fell 16 per cent year-on-year to Rs 299 crore on sluggish exports.
Export sales in the quarter fell by 4.6 per cent, according to company presentation.
Exports mainly hit by higher captive consumption of raw materials, more focus on integration into new markets, say analysts.

Tata Power Falls 4% on Surprise Loss in Q2
NDTV | Updated On: November 14, 2014 11:02 (IST)
Sensex, Nifty Trade Flat; Infosys Falls 4%
Shares in Tata Power Company fell nearly 4 per cent to a day low of Rs 85.35 on Friday as the power utility reported a surprise loss of Rs 78 crore in the September quarter. Tata Power was the top Nifty loser in morning trade.
Analysts polled by NDTV expected the company to report a profit of Rs 329 crore. Higher interest cost and tax outgo led to losses in the September quarter, they said.
Interest expenses of the company grew 22 per cent year-on-year to Rs 979 crore, while tax outgo jumped 39 per cent year-on-year to Rs 174 crore.
Revenue for the three months ending September also declined 5 per cent year-on-year to Rs 8,364 crore against Rs 8,764 crore in the same period last fiscal.
Weak performance in Q2 was led by no accounting of compensatory tariff at Mundra plant and poor performance at coal mines.
Stress continues on cashflows due to delay in compensatory tariff for Mundra plant, the company said on Thursday.
As of 9.48 a.m. shares in Tata Power traded 2.76 per cent lower at Rs 86.30 apiece, underperforming the broader Nifty which was up 0.2 per cent.

Stock market indices on Friday scaled record highs on sharp fall in wholesale inflation, persistent foreign capital inflows and good bluechip earnings with benchmark Sensex rising 106.02 points to end at fresh closing peak of 28,046.66.
Similarly, buying mainly in realty, metal and refinery counters lifted the NSE Nifty index by 32.05 points, or 0.38%, to end at new closing high of 8,389.90.
The wholesale price inflation dropped to a 5-year low of 1.77% in October due to fall in food prices. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was at 2.38% in September and 7.24% in October 2013.
This data comes after easing of consumer price index.
"We expect that milder-than-expected inflation and low industrial growth are strong reasons to expect a 25-bp policy rate cut at the RBI's coming 2nd December monetary policy meet," said a Anand Rathi Institutional Research report.
Besides, data showing that Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) buying shares worth a net Rs. 690.61 crore on Thursday, also gave a boost to the buying momentum.
"News flow both domestic and globally has been in favour of equity markets and that makes Indian markets one of the favourite destinations for the flow of risk investments," said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
In bluechip earnings, State-run State Bank of India
posted 30.5% growth in net profit at Rs. 3,100.41 crore for the quarter ended September 30, pushing its shares up by 2.55%.

SBI Q2 Profit Lags Estimates on Rise in Bad Loan Provision
Reuters | Updated On: November 14, 2014 19:51 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
State Bank of India, India's largest lender, warned on Friday there would be no quick fix for the country's banks, as improvements in loan quality will be gradual while a pick-up in credit demand could be a year away.
SBI, which accounts for about a quarter of loans and deposits in India, on Friday reported a 52 percent increase in provisions for bad loans in its second quarter -- a Rs 4030 crore hit that dampened profit growth.
SBI and peers such as ICICI Bank Ltd have suffered a surge in bad loans as economic expansion in the country slowed to below 5 percent in the past two fiscal years - the worst spell of sluggish growth in quarter of a century.
Signs of a revival in economic indicators have made banks optimistic, though a high level of bad loans is widely expected to persist for the next few quarters while credit growth hovers near its slowest rate in a decade.
"When we will see asset quality is improving, I don't believe that we will really see anything very sharp because this downturn has been very deep," SBI Chairwoman Arundhati Bhattacharya told a news conference.
"Once we see the demand cycle coming back, definitely we can begin to see things happening at a faster pace," she said, adding that was still about a year away.
SBI posted a net profit of Rs 3100 crore, an increase of 30.5 percent from the same period a year earlier but short of the Rs 3254 crore average analyst estimate in a Reuters poll.
More than two dozen state banks account for over 70 percent of advances in India - and also the bulk of the bad loans. Analysts estimate Indian lenders will need to raise as much as $110 billion over the next four years, to comply with global rules demanding stronger bank reserves as a buffer in times of crisis.
SBI's net non-performing loans as a percentage of net loans rose to 2.73 percent in the September quarter from 2.66 percent in the previous three months.
The pace of increase in bad loans slowed in the quarter, however, helping to send the stock to a five-month high.
Ms Bhattacharya, who took the helm just over a year ago, has vowed to tackle the increase in troubled loans by boosting vigilance and upgrading systems and software.

DRDO floats idea to set up fund to support defence start-ups
Nov 14, 2014, 04.11PM IST
(Avinash Chander,Director…)
HYDERABAD: The DRDO has proposed setting up of an exclusive Central fund with an initial corpus of Rs 100-200 crore for supporting start-ups and smaller units in the areas of research, development and production in defence sector.
Speaking on the sidelines of Defence & Aerosupply India 2014 here, Avinash Chander, Director General of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) said it is also planning to set up ten centres of technology where students in specialised fields can work on various defence-related projects, across the country in next five years.
"I think there is a need for supporting start-ups. A lot of talent is there but they don't have incubation centres. They can develop an idea but to sustain that idea till it becomes a mature product, they require some funding support. And that's where I feel that a fund of this kind (as a soft loan) for upcoming industrialists till their turnover becomes sufficiently large, will help them grow in a big way," Chander said.
He said the fund can be set up with Rs 100-200 crore to start with.
According to him, talks are also going on at the Central level for creating a material bank where stock of critical material is maintained.
Chandar said the DRDO is planning to earmark around Rs 500 crore every year for setting up centres of technology and is aiming to set up two such centres soon.
On the proposed missile testing centre at Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh, he said they are awaiting clearances from environmental agencies.
"We need 250 acres of land for setting up of our facilities and a small launch pad facility. Also, we have to get clearances from environmental agencies for the missile test range.The facility needs Rs 1500 crore investment," he said.
The three-day Defence & Aerosupply India 2014 organised by an Israel-Kenes Exhibitions and Telangana Government concluded today.

The Russian-made combat aircraft fleet was grounded after a crash near Pune on October 14.
The Indian Air Force’s frontline fighter jet, Sukhoi-30, has been cleared for flying after being grounded for nearly a month.
The entire fleet of about 200 Su-30s had been grounded following a Sukhoi crash in Pune on October 14. “The Sukhoi-30 fleet has been cleared for flying,” IAF spokesperson Wing Commander S.S. Birdi said on Friday.
Pune crash
On the reasons behind the Pune crash, IAF Chief Arup Raha told reporters, “This accident appeared to be due to automatic firing of the seats. The Court of Inquiry is about to be completed and the findings are being finalised.”
A team of 10 Russian experts joined the Indian experts in probing the cause of the crash in which the fighter jet crash landed on its belly around 20 km from the runway, while the pilots ejected safely.
Third instance
This was the third and also the longest period the Sukhoi fleet was grounded since its first crash in 2009.
Su-30s are the most modern of the IAF’s fighter jets and represent almost a third of its fighter fleet.

Philae lander plants thermometer oncometA handout artist impression showing lander Philae separating from the Rosetta spacecraft and descending to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, made available by the European Space Agency (ESA) on November 12, 2014. (Source: Reuters)
By: Associated Press | Berlin | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:13 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 5:16 pm
Europe’s Philae lander is doing well and has succeeded in planting a thermometer in the comet where it touched down this week, the European Space Agency said Friday.
Scientists have received a steady stream of data from the lander, which on Wednesday became the first spacecraft to touch down on a comet and has since sent its first images from the surface of the body, known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
However, their job is complicated by the fact that Philae landed next to a cliff that is blocking sunlight from its solar panels.
Planting a thermometer in the surface was Philae’s first so-called “mechanical operation” but ESA says it will hold off on any more for now. Scientists hope to drill into the comet to extract some of the material buried beneath the surface of the comet, which is streaking through space at 41,000 mph (66,000 kph) some 311 million miles (500 million kilometers) from Earth.
The lander’s primary battery only has power for another day or so and mission controllers are contemplating how they might realign it so that the solar panels can charge the craft. An update on the mission from ESA was scheduled for later Friday.
Two harpoons that should have anchored the washing machine-sized Philae to the surface weren’t deployed during Wednesday’s landing.
That caused the lander to bounce off the comet and drift through the void for two hours before touching down again. After a second, smaller bounce, scientists believe it came to rest in a shallow crater on the comet’s 2{ mile (4-kilometer) wide body, or nucleus.
Communication with the lander is slow, with signals taking more than 28 minutes to travel between Earth and Philae’s mother ship, the Rosetta orbiter flying above the comet.

Iraqi forces drive Islamic State from refinery town of BeijiPrint
By: Associated Press | Bhagdad | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:08 pm
Two Iraqi security officials say that government forces have driven out Islamic State militants from the entire oil refinery town of Beiji, north of Baghdad.
The officials say that Iraqi troops on Friday also lifted the Islamic State group’s siege of the oil refinery, Iraq’s largest.
The officials, reached by phone in Beiji, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to media.
Iraqi state TV also reported the “liberation of Beiji”, quoting the top army commander there, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi.
Islamic State extremists captured Beiji during their summer blitz across north and western Iraq. The Iraqi forces had collapsed in the face of that onslaught but have since partially regrouped and went on the offensive, with Beiji the biggest locality they have recaptured to date.

Sensex Rises to Record Closing Highs; Domestic Oriented Blue-Chips GainSensex, Nifty Trade Flat; Infosys Falls 4%
Mumbai: The BSE Sensex ended at a record closing high on Friday as foreign investors continued to pile into domestically oriented blue-chips such as Asian Paints amid a slide in crude oil prices and data showing easing wholesale inflation.
Overseas investors bought shares worth Rs 690 crore on Thursday, bringing their total purchase in stocks to $15.12 billion so far in 2014. They have also pumped in $23.15 billion in debt so far, regulatory data showed.
Hopes for easing inflation are also helping spur share gains. Data on Friday showed the wholesale price index rose an annual 1.77 percent last month, its slowest since September 2009, while data on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose at the slowest rate on record.
India will also benefit from Brent sliding below $77 per barrel to its four-year low, as it imports more than two-thirds of its fuel requirements.
"Flows are positive on all counts as India stands out on growth prospects versus other emerging markets. The rally should extend," said Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance.
The Sensex closed 0.38 per cent higher, marking its all-time closing high of 28,046.66.
The broader Nifty also gained 0.38 per cent to end at a record closing high of 8,389.90.
Domestic oriented stocks led the gains. Asian Paints rose 4.3 per cent, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp ended 1.9 per cent higher.
Coal India rose 2.7 per cent, while GAIL (India) rose 2.8 per cent.
State Bank of India ended 2.5 per cent higher after earlier marking its highest level since May 26, on better-than-expected asset quality due to lower slippages and restructuring in the July-September quarter.
Shares in its associate units also surged after the lender said it was close to coming up with a roadmap on associate bank mergers.
State Bank of Travancore surged 6.6 per cent, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur jumped 2.7 per cent, while State Bank of Mysore soared 5.6 per cent.
SBI's results also improved sentiment towards other state-run banks. Bank of Baroda rose 1.5 per cent, while Punjab National Bank ended up 0.4 per cent.
Among decliners, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries fell 2.4 per cent and Cipla lost 2.3 per cent after their July-Sept earnings disappointed investors.

Russia to G-20: Were here. So are ourwarships.Four Russian warships have entered international waters off the northeast Australian coast to coincide with Putin's visit to Australia. (Source: AP)

Vladimir Putin is underlining his presence at a major summit of world leaders in Australia by stationing warships in waters off the country’s northeastern coast, prompting the Australian prime minister to angrily accuse Russia of trying to reclaim the “lost glories” of the Soviet Union.
The diplomatic drama, which has been simmering since a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over an area of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists in July, threatened to overshadow Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s goal of keeping this weekend’s G-20 summit focused on economic growth.
But Abbott, who had previously said he would physically confront the Russian president over the Flight 17 disaster that killed 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents, did little to dampen tensions with his latest critique of Putin’s Russia.
In recent days, four Russian warships have entered international waters off the northeast Australian coast to coincide with Putin’s visit to Australia for the summit that brings together the leaders of the world’s 20 biggest industrialized and developing economies. Australia, in turn, sent three warships of its own to monitor them.
The Russian embassy said on Friday that Russia’s Pacific fleet was testing its range, and could be used as security for Putin. Abbott was not impressed.
“Russia is being much more assertive now than it has been for a very long time,” he said at a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron, also in Australia for the summit. “Interestingly, Russia’s economy is declining even as Russia’s assertiveness is increasing.”
The prime minister, who met with Putin earlier this week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Beijing, aired details of his conversation with the Russian leader.
“One of the points that I tried to make to President Putin is that Russia would be so much more attractive if it was aspiring to be a superpower for peace and freedom and prosperity … instead of trying to recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the old Soviet Union.”
Abbott, an athletic 56-year-old former amateur boxer whose government is a staunch US ally, has gained a higher international profile by loudly demanding more cooperation from Russia on the Dutch-led investigation into the downing of Flight 17.
He raised eyebrows last month when he declared he intended to “shirtfront” Putin, using an Australian football term for a head-on shoulder charge to an opponent’s chest.
Cameron also took a swipe at Russia, warning that Western sanctions against the country could increase if it continues to foster the rebellion in eastern Ukraine.
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel downplayed the appearance of Russia’s ships.
“I find it much more serious that there are violations of Ukraine’s territorial integrity,” Merkel said during a press conference in Auckland, New Zealand, which she is visiting en route to the G-20.
Putin was expected to arrive in Australia for the summit in the eastern city of continued…

FIPB approves 74% foreign investment in HDFC BankFIPB clears HDFC Bank's proposal to hike foreign holding to 74 per cent

(The FIPB is of the view that…)
NEW DELHI: The FIPB today cleared the long-pending proposal of HDFC Bank to hike foreign holding in the bank to 74 per cent.
"FIPB today considered and approved HDFC Bank's proposal to raise foreign investment ceiling to 74 per cent," officials said after the meeting of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.
The FIPB is of the view that HDFC Bank' parent HDFC Ltd's 22.5 per cent holding in the bank is FDI and hence total foreign holding is 73.2 per cent, which includes FII , FDI, ADR and GDR.
"So, the bank now has little headroom to raise funds from foreign investors," the officials said.
Total foreign investment in HDFC Bank was 73.39 per cent at the end of June 2014. It came down to 73.2 per cent at the end of September 2014.
Asked about any possible imposition of penalty by RBI for breaching foreign investment limit by HDFC Bank, sources said it would be decided by the banking sector regulator.
"It would be looked into by RBI if HDFC Bank had breached the foreign investment limit or not," sources said.
Late last year, HDFC Bank, a foreign-owned lender, had approached the FIPB for increasing the foreign holding in the bank to 67.55 per cent from 49 per cent. The bank had sought permission for raising foreign investment limit representing that 22 per cent stake held by the parent HDFC Ltd is a domestic investment.
However, the proposal was not cleared by the FIPB as the Finance and Industry ministries were of the view that HDFC Ltd's 22.5 per cent holding in the bank is FDI.
Taking into consideration the 22.5 per cent parent holding as FDI, the total foreign holding was more than 67.55 per cent when they approached the FIPB for the first time.
Following clarification sought by FIPB earlier this year, HDFC Bank had sent a revised proposal raising its foreign holding ceiling request to 74 per cent, from its earlier proposal of 67.55 per cent.
Banks can have up to 49 per cent foreign investment without regulatory approval but require approval from RBI and the FIPB if they want to increase the foreign investment limit to 74 per cent.
Further, the proposal of pharma company Sanofi was cleared by FIPB in today's meeting along with Punj Llyod's proposal to enter the defence space. FIPB also cleared a proposal of Sun Pharma.
As many as 26 proposals were considered, out of which 15 were approved and rest were deferred, sources said.

Rupee Ends Lower at 61.72 Amid Broad Dollar Gains
Reuters | Updated On: November 14, 2014 17:47 (IST)
Rupee Flat; Asian Currencies Hit as Dollar Rallies
Mumbai: The rupee saw its biggest single-day fall in a week on Friday tracking a continued resurgence globally in the dollar, even as strong foreign buying continues to lift domestic share markets to record highs.
The rupee fell 0.1 per cent for the week, posting its third consecutive weekly fall, despite rallies this month in debt and share markets over solid foreign buying.
Falls in emerging market currencies such as the rupee come as the dollar has strengthened. On Friday, it rose to a 7-year high against the yen as investors bumped up their bets on Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calling an early election and delaying a hike in sales tax.
"There was some defence-related buying, and compared to other Asian currencies, the rupee has still not weakened as such, so some catching up there," said Uday Bhatt, a foreign exchange dealer with UCO Bank.
"In the absence of any major data domestically, the rupee will hold in a 61.50 to 62.00 range early next week," he added.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.72/73 per dollar versus its previous close of 61.5450/5600. The unit dropped 0.2 per cent on day, its biggest single-day loss since last Friday.
Some traders speculated that state-run banks were buying dollars on behalf of the central bank, though it was not a universal view.
Traders will continue to monitor domestic share and debt markets for clues on foreign fund inflows into these markets.
Indian shares rose to a record closing high as foreign investors continued to pile into domestically oriented blue-chips.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 62.01, while the three-month was at 62.56.

Skoda offers discounts on theRapidSkoda launched the new Rapid sedan in September (Source: Gaadi.com)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:53 pm
Skoda has been struggling to keep up with its competition in India. It currently hold less than 1 per cent market share in India, according to sales figures for the month of October 2014. Skoda had launched the new Rapid sedan in September, and the car has been selling just over 1,000 units every month since.  This is a far cry from the segment leader, the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz which has sold over 6,000 units in October 2014.
Skoda is now offering discounts on all variants of the new Rapid, except the DSG-equipped diesel variants. The Skoda Rapid is priced from Rs. 7.22 – 9.82 lakh for the petrol variants, while the Rapid diesel variants (not including the DSG-equipped automatic variants) are priced from Rs. 8.39 – 9.87 lakh. All the prices mentioned above are ex-showroom Delhi.
The discounts offered include free 1st year comprehensive insurance, a Rs. 30,000 exchange bonus, free 4-year road-side assistance and 4-year warranty. Corporate discounts will also apply to those eligible for it.
The new Skoda Rapid is now powered by either a 1.5-litre diesel engine (which replaced the 1.6-litre diesel offered earlier) or a 1.6-litre petrol engine. The 1.5-litre diesel engine is mated to either a 5-speed manual transmission or the brilliant 7-speed DSG automatic gearbox. The Skoda Rapid diesel DSG is one of the few diesel automatic sedans in the segment, the others include the Volkswagen Vento DSG and the Hyundai Verna automatic. On the other hand the Skoda Rapid petrol is mated to either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed triptronic automatic.
The Black Pack for the Rapid adds visual elements like black alloy wheels, black grille, black ORVM covers and blackened headlamps on the top-end elegance variant. Other additions on the Rapid include cruise control and rear parking sensors.

J&K floods: BJP blames Omar Abdullah govt for ignoring METalertsMoS PMO Jitendra Singh with BJP National General Secretary Ram Madav (C), MP Jugal Kishore (L) addressing a press conference in Jammu on Friday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:50 pm | Updated: November 15, 2014 2:23 am
Launching an aggressive poll campaigning in J&K, MoS in the PMO Jitendra Singh on Friday released the BJP’s “charge-sheet”, accusing the Omar Abdullah government of ignoring repeated warnings by the Meteorological Department about impending floods, which eventually claimed more than 200 lives.
Reading from the four-page “chargesheet” which, according to him, was the first in a series, Singh said that the department had sent alerts to the state government for “five straight days before September 7, when devastating floods ravaged the historic Srinagar city”. At one point, the department even “went beyond its duty”, warning the government that continuous rains could “trigger flash floods and landslides and disrupt road and air transport”, he added.
“Though the department has no mandate to issue alerts about landslides and flash floods, the developing weather prompted it to go ahead with the warning,” he said, adding that “it was a difficult choice to make because such a warning could have triggered panic among the people”.
He said that “four days before Srinagar sank,” the MeT had on September 3 sent a “specific warning” to the government.
A copy of this warning was also sent to the Chief Engineer Mechanical Division, Srinagar, and other government departments, he said. Quoting sources in the MeT Department, Singh read that “whenever western disturbance and strong monsoon currents meet, it creates a strong system which has often led to floods in Kashmir in the past’’.

Sterilisation deaths: Probe panel formed; drug firm chief  son heldA single-member commission under retired judge Anita Jha was constituted on Friday to probe the botched sterilisation surgeries at Bilaspur's government-run medical camps that have so far claimed lives of 13 women and left nearly 138 ill.
 
As Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh came under attack over the deaths and allegations of spurious drugs being given, the director of a drug company, which allegedly supplied sub-standard medicines that were administered to the victims, and his son were arrested in state capital Raipur.
 
"A single-member probe commission has been constituted and retd. District and sessions Judge Anita Jha has been entrusted with the responsibility of investigating the case of sterilisation surgeries at Sankri (Pendari), Gaurela, Pendra and Marwahi areas of Bilaspur district, where 13 women died and several fell critically ill after undergoing surgery," a government statement said.
 
The commission has been asked to submit its report to the state government within three months, it said.
 
CM Singh had on Thursday announced an unbiased and transparent judicial probe into the incidents following which, the General Administration Department issued a notification last evening regarding formation of the panel.
 
The CM, meanwhile, rejected the Congress' demand for his resignation. "Will by resignation resolve this issue. This is no option. Congress is only trying to politicise the issue," he said.
 
While 83 women were operated upon at Nemichand Jain Cancer and Research Centre at Pendari village of Takhatpur block on November 8, around 56 women underwent surgeries at three different camps in Pendra block on November 10.
 
The commission will investigate the case on number of points, including if standard protocol was followed at these camps, circumstances that led to the incident, whether medicines used at the camps were of standard quality, who are those accountable for this incident, measures that can be taken to avoid recurrence of such incidents and others, the statement added.
 
Mahawar Pharma Pvt Ltd's director Ramesh Mahwar and his son Sumit have been arrested under section 420 for cheating, based on a complaint lodged by Food and Drug Administration authorities, Raipur SP OP Pal told PTI.

The FDA had on Thursdsay sealed a manufacturing unit of the company which supplied an antibiotic drug used at sterilisation camps in Bilaspur district.
 
During the raid, a significant quantity of drugs were found burnt at the premises of Mahawar Pharma, official sources in the drugs control department had said.
 
After preliminary examination of the samples of the medicines collected from the pharmaceutical unit, drug inspector Tripti Jain lodged a case against the promoters following which the action was taken.
 
The department had on Thursday evening also raided a unit of another pharmaceuticals company in Bilaspur, which too had allegedly supplied some medicines to the sterilisation camps in the district, and collected drug samples from there for testing.
 
The state government has suspended sale of six drugs used in tubectomy surgeries at these sterilisation camps.
 
Putting the onus for the botch up on officers, the CM said they did not follow the guidelines issued by the state. "We will not spare anyone," he said.
 
"Surgeries were conducted in unhygienic condiditons," he said, adding, "We are probing whether drugs given were spurious."
 
Laparoscopic surgeon Dr RK Gupta of Bilaspur district hospital, who is accused of carrying out tubectomy procedures on 83 women at a camp at Pendari village in a matter of few hours, was arrested on Wednesday.
 
Gupta and Bilaspur's chief medical and health officer Dr RK Bhange were later dismissed from service by the state government.

Nehru: The writer  the historianpeople
Whosoever is in power, Jawaharlal Nehru’s memory must be kept alive in the interest of our democratic and secular values. Students of Indian history will benefit from his writings, which embrace the creative thrust and splendour of the Continental and Indian civilisation
Certain segments in our society are engaged in a futile and odious comparison between the tall leaders of our freedom struggle; some others are out to diminish Jawaharlal Nehru’s stature and repudiate his legacy. Without being swayed by the rhetoric of the publicists or the ill-informed mediamen, we need to bolster Nehru’s position as the second best leader after the Mahatma. “Swachh Bharat” will not do. Whosoever is in power, Nehru’s memory must be kept alive in the interest of our democratic and secular values. Students of Indian history, on the other hand, will benefit from his writings, which embrace the creative thrust and splendour of the Continental and Indian civilisation.
Nehru was a voracious reader: he read 55 books from May 21, 1922 till January 29, 1923 alone. He delved into philosophy, and turned the pages of history to illuminate his understanding of the ideas and movements, which stood apart as the catalyst for momentous changes. In so doing, he looked through other people’s writings to understand how simple, ordinary men and women became heroes, and how their strivings made history stirring and epoch-making. Prison had made a man of him, he told the Socialist leader, Acharya Narendra Deva (1889-1956), while they were in jail for the last time in 1942.
Writing to regenerate
Why did he write? Who did he write for? He had no archives to consult; so he relied on his recollections and on bits of information that he could conceal. He disliked being called a writer, and yet, armed with a varied experience of affairs, writing became a congenial occupation. Sometimes he didn’t write for weeks, now and again he wrote daily. His letters from jail represented his moods and thoughts at the time of each event; they were also his escapes from gaol.
He wrote to regenerate his generation, to render them capable of following Gandhiji’s non-violent satyagraha, and to put before them the tangled web of current affairs in Russia, Germany, England, America, Japan, China, France, Spain, Italy and Central Europe. It was a tangled web no doubt, difficult to unravel and difficult even to see as a whole. Yet, he presented the many-coloured life of other ages and countries, analysed the ebb and flow of the old civilisations, and took up ideas in their full flow. The superimposed loneliness empowered him to turn to himself for fellowship and guidance, arrange his thoughts, and evolve his political creed undisturbed by external influences. This exercise affected the whole gamut of his emotions.
In enchantment of history
Jawaharlal Nehru’s writings transmit the enthusiasm and animation he felt for the discipline of history. In fact, there is something uncanny about the way in which a self-taught and amateur historian like him explored the unbounded universe in full variety. True, his vision was far from settled, but it was being etched out in conjunction and in contention with other voices.
He lived in the enchantment of the ancient and medieval histories of India, and sought to understand it in terms of the present and even of the future to come. Why should there be so much misery in the world? This question troubled him. Why do people argue and quarrel among themselves as a sect or a religious group? Why are they blind to the vision of freedom? His comments on political affairs, many of which tend to corroborate or supplement, to a fair degree, with the information that is available to us from some other sources.
Nehru asked what he was heir to, and answered that he was heir to all that humanity had achieved over tens of thousands of years, to all that it had thought and felt and suffered and taken joy in, to its cries of triumph and its bitter agonies of defeat, to that astonishing adventure, which had begun so long ago and yet continued and beckoned to man. Besides commenting on the wisdom of India’s great inexhaustible spiritual heritage, he talked of the vital necessity to apply it intelligently and reasonably to the present and the future.
His vision was hardly ever trapped in the exclusivist, culturological mode; far from it; it was supremely inclusive and driven by a belief in the existence, even the necessity of cultures constantly interacting with each other, of cultures working on and transforming the other and their own through a live contact. In fact, he talked of a whole people becoming full of faith for a great cause, and brought to the fore their treasures of knowledge, learning, heroism and devotion. He looked at the entire world with a fresh eye and gave a balanced view of man’s life on many continents. His was a global view — not an Asian view any more than it was a European one.
Understanding ideas
With this eclectic approach, he called for breaking down national histories and constructing a more relevant world history as a means to understand the global exchange of ideas in the past and the necessity of exchange for a better future. He wanted books not for specialists alone but also for the general, interested lay reader in a popular and accessible mode. He wanted books on the daily lives of ordinary men and women who lived in the past (family budgets from hundreds of years ago, he suggests could show us how life was organised in that age!). And he wanted Asia’s history to be read as widely as possible so that the readers should think of all the countries and all the peoples, and not merely of one little country.
“ Without being swayed by the rhetoric of the publicists or the ill-informed mediamen, we need to bolster Nehru’s position as the second best leader after the Mahatma. ‘Swachh Bharat’ will not do. ”
Glimpses of World History is not a standard textbook, but it still makes an impression of sustained intellectual power. Received with a chorus of admiration, it has become standard reading in India, Africa, Europe, and the United States. Fenner Brockway (1888-1988), a friend of India and for many years Secretary of the Independent Labour Party, mentioned that his daughter learnt more from Glimpses than any other history book she had studied at school.
Written almost entirely in prison in the 1930s, it bears the mark of a passionate, albeit humane, nationalism. Others have also put pen to paper on their life and times, but the biography glows with patriotic feelings. There is no cover-up, and no concealment of facts. As for the “self,” the influences are too subtle, too diffused, to be easily identified or measured. The author loved India tenderly, and, in the words of Monod, to him that loved, much may be forgiven.
Autobiographical confessions cannot be regarded as accurate descriptions of a consistent life, and yet Jawaharlal Nehru’s narrative is out of the ordinary precisely for its tropes and figures of thought, without which he would not have turned the real events of life into a narrative and transform them from a chronicle into a story.
The Discovery of India is a hymn to the glories of India. He mapped the metaphysical and philosophic approach to life, idealised ancient India as a world apart, independent of and superior to the rest of the civilisations, toning down the barbarism of the caste system and throwing the warm colours of fancy around his narrative. At the same time, with his eyes set on India’s infinite charm, variety and oneness he worked ceaselessly for a synthesis, drawing on the best, and breaking with the worst. He consciously followed Gandhi and Tagore in the direction of the universal. Consequently, India appears in The Discovery as a space of ceaseless cultural mixing, and in the past as a celebration of the soiling effects of cultural miscegenation and accretion.
The Nehruvian legacy
While the romantic in Nehru drew on the old and new interpretations to buttress an ecumenical and universalistic point of view, some of the other Indian writers did so from a rather narrow perspective. He conducts the reader through the labyrinth of a colonial era, narrates the most complex events, and recreates portraits of outstanding fellow countrymen. By and large, his writings make public the spirit and substance of his many-sidedness, the deep-seated urge to freedom, and the negative response to the concomitants and consequences of colonial rule.
What is the Nehruvian legacy? Those living in a vibrant parliamentary democracy and amid creative institutions should not ask this question unless they wish to be identified with the Nehru-debunkers. They must remember that Nehru kept the country together, established secular ideals, propelled it forward with the thrust of science and modernity, healed some of the wounds of Partition, and stood before the world at the head of the non-aligned camp. “Men may break,” Gandhi was to say on the eve of the Quit India Movement, “but they should not bend beyond brute force.” His political heir did just that through his public life. He shared with tens and thousands of prisoners the changing moods of exaltations and depressions, of intense activity and enforced leisure. He buttressed the idea that man is not just a simple individual but a crowd of thoughts and ideas.
What raised Nehru in public estimation was his concern for the poor and the underprivileged. The life of the people, which flows in a dark current beneath political events, attracted his attention — the circumstances, sorrows and joys of millions of humble men and women. Even if his personal misfortunes had a melodramatic tinge, there was, always, a constant element of moral austerity to serve as a counterweight.

They hang on from buses, take boats across swelling rivers or haggle with rickshaw drivers to get to school. Not each one of them has the perks for commuting in a chauffeur driven car or a bus that picks them up from front of their house. They even take secluded roads but don't let the perils come in way of receiving education.

Gold price falls 1% as dollar hits 7-year high against yenGold price falls as dollar hits 7-year high against yen
A. Ananthalakshmi     Singapore   Last Updated: November 14, 2014  | 13:08 IST

Gold price tumbled 1 per cent on Friday and looked likely to finish lower for a third week in four, as a resilient dollar and strong US economic data undercut bullion's appeal as a hedge.
The dollar rose to a fresh seven-year high against the yen on Friday, and held close to a four-year peak against a basket of major currencies.
Spot gold fell 1 per cent to $1,149.56 an ounce before paring some losses to trade down 0.9 per cent at $1,151.50 an ounce by 0708 GMT. It is down 2 per cent for the week. US gold futures slid 1 per cent, while spot silver and silver futures fell over 2 per cent.
"Gold is reacting to the move in the dollar-yen. Dollar's highs versus the yen has been a key factor for the last two weeks now," said a trader in Singapore. The metal has failed to recover strongly from a four-and-a-half-year low of $1,131.85 hit last week, on steady outflows from gold-backed funds.
Strong US data on Thursday also hurt gold. The number of new US jobless claims rose last week but remained near a 14-year low, suggesting the US labour market was moving toward full health. A robust economy could prompt the US Federal Reserve to soon raise interest rates, hurting non-interest-bearing gold.
The bearishness in bullion's outlook was reflected in holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's top gold-backed exchange-traded fund. The fund's holdings fell 0.3 per cent to 720.62 tonnes on Thursday - an eighth straight day of declines and a six-year low.
Traders were also closely tracking developments in No. 2 gold consumer India, where officials are considering curbs on imports. Any new restrictions could raise local premiums against the global benchmark and hurt consumer demand. Reduced Indian gold buying would also pressure global prices, already smarting from weakening demand in China.
In news from the physical markets, consumers in Japan sold gold jewellery and bars as yen-priced bullion hit three-month highs and the Japanese currency slid, while buying interest elsewhere in Asia picked up.

DreamWorks Animation (DWA) soared 14% to $25.52 Thursday on reports that  toymaker Hasbro (HAS) is in talks to acquire  the film studio.
DreamWorks is known for such animated movie franchises as Shrek and Madagascar.
The New York Times, citing anonymous sources briefed on the talks, reported that Hasbro is in "advanced talks" with the film studio about a potential deal financed with a combination of cash and stock. A price has not been determined.
Hasbro fell 4.3% to $54.98.
According to Deadline.com , "DreamWorks Animation is deeply engaged in two potentially game changing negotiations that could transform the company — including one with Hasbro to forge a family entertainment powerhouse to be called DreamWorks-Hasbro. The other talks are with Hearst to turn DWA's AwesomenessTV into a joint venture."
DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg would become chairman of the combined compan, the website says.
In September, Japanese telecom giant SoftBank was reported to have held talks with DreamWorks, but the negotiations didn't lead to a public offer. SoftBank owns Sprint.
Hasbro and DreamWorks Animation declined to comment.
Toy analyst Margaret Whitfield says that "given the importance of the Disney relationship to Hasbro, I doubt the deal would proceed without first ensuring Disney had no objection.  If bought, it would be another platform to transform its (Hasbro) many toy properties into entertainment brands as it has done with several studios."

In another instance of ‘thana attack’ trend in Bengal, an irate mob on Friday attacked Alipore police station, one of the most posh area in south Kolkata and located at a security zone with West Bengal police head quarter near by. The mob from a local slum today barged into the police station beating the guards at the gate of the police station. The mob later entered the police station premises and started throwing stones at the office.
Tension gripped the area after a PWD team went to a local slum to vacate the vested land of the state government that was encroached by the locals. When the PWD team accompanied by police personnel asked the slum dwellers to relocate at some other place, they started agitating in the area and claimed they were given ‘patta’ by the Left Front government. However, the eviction process did not start at that time.
To control the agitation in the area, police picked up at least 10 protesters and brought them to the police station which was followed by the mob outrage. A strong mob led by a couple of local TMC leaders entered the police station premises and tried to ransack the police station as there were a few police personnel present at the spot. Clips of police personnel trying to hide under the tables to escape the attack were telecast in the local channels.
In minutes, reinforcement rushed to the spot and chased the mob away from the police station premises, though the mob later blocked the road in front of Bhawani Bhavan, head quarter of West Bengal police and CID. The crowd was dispersed soon from the area and blockade was withdrawn after senior police and PWD officials spoke to them.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The former CEO who oversaw the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, killing 29 people, was indicted Thursday on federal charges related to a safety investigation that followed the blast.
Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who is accused of conspiring to violate safety and health standards at Upper Big Branch Mine, is the highest-ranking executive to face charges in the blast. The explosion and investigation afterward led to the overhaul of the way the federal government oversees mine safety.
U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said a federal grand jury indicted Blankenship on charges including conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards, conspiracy to impede federal mine safety officials, making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and securities fraud.
Blankenship could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted.
His attorney, William W. Taylor III, said in a statement that Blankenship "is entirely innocent of these charges. He will fight them and he will be acquitted."
"Don Blankenship has been a tireless advocate for mine safety," the statement said. "His outspoken criticism of powerful bureaucrats has earned this indictment. He will not yield to their effort to silence him. He will not be intimidated."
News about Blankenship's indictment spread fast in the mining community. Pam Napper, whose son, Josh Napper, was among the miners killed at Upper Big Branch, said she was elated.
"I think it's about time," Napper said. "He was a big part of this. He knew what was going on in that mine and continued to let it go. I hope he gets what he deserves. I am so excited. They aren't sad tears today. They're happy tears."
In February 2013, a former longtime subordinate testified that Blankenship ordered the widespread corporate practice of warning coal miners about surprise federal inspections. The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause of the blast was Massey's "systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts" to conceal life-threatening problems. MSHA said managers even maintained two sets of pre-shift inspection books — an accurate one for themselves, and a sanitized one for regulators.
The indictment says Blankenship conspired to violate mine safety and health standards at Upper Big Branch from January 2008 until April 2010, when the explosion tore through the mine.
After the explosion, Blankenship made false statements and representations to the SEC concerning Massey Energy's safety practices before the explosion. He made similar statements in connection with the purchase and sale of Massey Energy stock, the indictment said.
Alpha Natural Resources bought Massey for $7.1 billion in June 2012. Blankenship, who retired ahead of the merger, has denied any wrongdoing.
Four investigations into the Upper Big Branch explosion found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of coal dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno.
Former White Buck Coal Co. President David Hughart testified about Blankenship's alleged actions as he pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges as part of the investigation. Hughart, who never worked at Upper Big Branch, was eventually sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for his role.
Former Upper Big Branch superintendent Gary May was sentenced last year to two years and nine months in prison on charges he defrauded the government through his actions at the mine, including disabling a methane gas monitor and falsifying records. May cooperated with prosecutors in their criminal investigation of the worst U.S. coal mining disaster in 40 years.
May had testified at the February 2012 sentencing of former Massey security chief Hughie Elbert Stover, who was sent to prison for three years for lying to investigators and ordering a subordinate to destroy documents. It was one of the stiffest punishments ever handed down in a mine safety case.

World Bank warns of calamity if Ebola lessonsignoredWorld Bank president Jim Yong Kim speaks to the media ahead of the G-20 conference in Brisbane (Source: AP)
By: Agence-France Presse | Brisbane | Posted: November 14, 2014 6:22 pm
Millions of lives could be lost in a global pandemic if the international community repeats its tardy response to West Africa’s Ebola outbreak, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim warned on Friday.
Kim called for the establishment of a multi-billion dollar contingency fund to ensure relief efforts mobilise immediately when an infection threat such as Ebola or a rogue influenza strain emerges.
Such outbreaks were not only human tragedies but also threatened to destabilise the world economy, the Korean said at the G20 summit in Brisbane, where he is promoting his proposal to leaders of the world’s most powerful economies.
“It would require something like a global health corps – people from all over the world who’d be ready to respond at a moment’s notice – (and) a fund that would disperse millions, and indeed billions, of dollars if necessary,” he told reporters.
Kim said the world was slow to react to the worst Ebola outbreak on record, which has killed some 5,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
“The (Ebola) response was late and we all know that… if we had a flu pandemic that would move very quickly and potentially kill millions, we would need many billions of dollars dispersed right away,” he said.
He described the proposed fund as “almost like an insurance policy” for the world.
“When the World Health Organisation declares a global health emergency and invokes the international health regulations then, and only then would these funds be dispersed,” he said.
He said donors would not need to give money upfront, but would instead make arrangements to raise money on bond markets, adding “this is something we do all the time at the World Bank”.
The World Bank has estimated the financial impact of Ebola in the region could reach USD 32.6 billion by the end of 2015 if it continues to spread.
Kim said the crisis was far from over in West Africa, despite signs that infection rates were slowing in worst-hit Liberia, where there have been more than 2,800 deaths.
He said every single person infected by Ebola, one of the deadliest viruses known to man, needed to be tracked down.
“Ebola’s not a disease where you can leave a few cases and say that’s good enough, you’ve really got to get every country to zero… if we want to get to the endgame, that’s the way we have to go,” he said.
“Despite the pledges and the goodwill that’s been expressed, we still need much more. This is going to require many billions of dollars to get to zero in each of those three countries.”

October retail sales offer early take on holidaysOctober retail sales to offer early take on holidays

Retail sales figures are always key. But today’s reading on October activity at retailers’ cash registers will be even more closely watched because it will shed light on consumers’ health leading into the holiday shopping season.
After a ho-hum month in September, when retail sales tumbled 0.3%, Wall Street sees sales bumping up 0.2% in October, or 0.4%-0.5% if you strip out auto and gas sales.
(BREAKING NEWS: October retail sales topped expectations, with sales up 0.3% and up 0.6% if autos and gas sales are strippped out.)
“Stores are already pitching the holidays, and some people start shopping in October,” says JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.
October retail sales — as well as future sales — should get a boost from plunging gas prices, which act like a tax savings for consumers. “Gas prices are down, and that means consumers have more money to spend,” Kinahan says. Stocks’ record-setting run also should boost consumer confidence.
Kinahan wants October retail sales to show consumers are already out shopping for the holidays, which would suggest they’re upbeat heading into the start to the selling season on Black Friday and beyond. He also will be looking to see if sales in the food services and restaurant group back up the job gains reported in the October employment report.
Thursday, Walmart said “promotional” pricing will again be a big part of holiday sales. Kinahan would like to see signs that consumers are already snapping up merchandise on sale. But with stocks at record highs, there’s “more risk than reward” for the market this holiday season.

Sesa Sterlite to invest $782 m for zinc deposits in AfricaUpdated: November 13, 2014 23:42 IST
Sesa Sterlite to invest $782 m for zinc deposits in Africa
K. T. Jagannathan
metal and mineral
Will develop an open-pit zinc mine in Gamsberg, South Africa, and also take up conversion of the Skorpion Zinc Refinery in neighbouring Namibia.
The board of Sesa Sterlite, a subsidiary of London-listed Vedanta Resources Plc, has approved an investment of $782 million in Southern Africa over a three-year time zone.
The investment is primarily intended to develop large tracts of undeveloped deposits of metal in the region, and also to partially offset dipping volume of production from its mines in Ireland.
As part of this investment proposal, it will develop an open-pit zinc mine in Gamsberg, South Africa, and also take up conversion of the Skorpion Zinc Refinery in neighbouring Namibia.
The majority of the investment, approximately $630 million, will go towards developing an open-pit zinc mine, concentrator plant and associated infrastructure at Gamsberg, one of world’s largest undeveloped zinc deposits.
The balance investment will be used to convert the refinery at the Skorpion Mine in Rosh Pinah, Namibia. This will enable it to refine zinc concentrates from the Gamsberg mine into special high-grade zinc metal.
The Gamsberg project, located near Aggeneys in South Africa’s Northern Cape Province, is expected to generate 1,500 jobs during construction stage, and result in approximately 500 permanent jobs. The Gamsberg project will be operated under the auspices of Black Mountain Mining (BMM), which is 74 per cent owned by Sesa Sterlite Ltd. The remaining 26 per cent stake in BMM is held by Exxaro Resources Ltd., a diversified resources company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
The first phase of the Gamsberg open-pit mine is expected to have a total lifespan of approximately 13 years with the first ore likely to be produced in 2017/18.
The Gamsberg Zinc Project involves the development, construction and commissioning of a 4 million-tonne ROM open-pit zinc mine, concentrator and associated infrastructure at Gamsberg, 20km from the town of Aggeneys.
The company expects to commence construction of the new mine during the first quarter of 2015.

Bombay High Court stays quotas for Marathas  MuslimsFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The Bombay High Court today stayed implementation of the controversial decision of the erstwhile Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra to provide reservation to Marathas in government jobs and educational institutions announced ahead of the state Assembly election.
It also stayed the decision to provide five per cent reservation to Muslims in government service but allowed quotas for them in educational institutions.
Admitting a batch of Public Interest Litigations, a bench headed by Chief Justice Mohit Shah said the Supreme Court had already laid down the law for reservation which cannot exceed 50 per cent of the total seats.
52 per cent seats in government jobs and educational institutions were already reserved for the targeted groups and the Congress-NCP government had, in the run up to the Assembly poll, raised it to 73 per cent by announcing 16 per cent quotas for Marathas and five per cent for Muslims.
The court was of the view that the comparative data provided by the government justified its decision to introduce reservation for Muslims in government educational institutions. It, however, excluded private educational bodies from the purview of reservations for the minority community.
The government defended its decision on reservation to Marathas and Muslims contending that the two communities were socially and educationally backward and also economically poor. It said the decision was based on the report of a committee headed by former minister Narayan Rane set up to look into the issue.
The government said it had taken into consideration recommendations of Rajinder Sachar Committee and Mahmoodur Rahman Committee, both of which had recommended reservation for Muslims, while arriving at the decision to provide quotas for them.
The PILs challenging reservation for the two communities were filed by social activist Ketan Tirodkar, an NGO Youth for Equality, Anil Thanekar, I S Gilada of Indian Health Organisation and others.
Senior advocate Pradeep Sancheti, appearing for Youth for Equality, referred to the Supreme Court’s guidelines on reservations which said it cannot exceed 50 per cent of the total seats.
He also contended that it cannot be granted on the basis of religion.
Sancheti said the state government had not provided comparative data about population and backwardness of Muslims and Marathas vis-a-vis other communities. He questioned the government’s decision to introduce reservations “in a hurry” when Assembly elections were due.
Tirodkar and other petitioners, opposing the reservations, argued that Marathas and Muslims were not backward Communities.
Tirodkar contended that 75 per cent of cooperative sugar factories and as many of educational institutions in Maharashtra were controlled by Marathas. Also, they owned nearly 75 per cent of the land in the state.
Citing a report of the National Commission for Backward Classes in year 2000, he said Marathas were socially advanced and thus cannot be included in the list of backward classes.
He said the Commission, while rejecting the claim of Marathas for inclusion in the list of backward classes, said they had played a pioneering role in shaping socio-cultural and political history of modern Maharashtra and had been in the forefront of many spheres of the state’s development.

Old Navy Under Fire For Charging Plus-Size Women More Than Plus-Size MenOld Navy is in hot water over allegations that it charges extra for women's plus-size clothing, but not for men's . Now, the company is explaining what's behind the double standard.
A petition on Change.org that has gathered over 16,000 signatures states that Old Navy charges $12-$15 more for plus-sized women's jeans than for "regular" sizes, but does not do the same for men's plus-sized jeans. The petition was first reported on by BuzzFeed.
It's not uncommon for a company to charge more for plus-size clothes. In the past, companies have justified higher prices for larger clothing items by saying the extra fabric costs manufacturers more. But this wouldn't explain the disparity in Old Navy's pricing of plus-sized clothing for different genders.
A spokeswoman for Gap, which owns Old Navy, said that women's plus-sized clothing costs more because it has special features that men's apparel doesn't.
"Old Navy is proud to offer styles and apparel designed specifically for our plus-size female customer, which includes curve-enhancing and curve-flattering elements such as four-way stretch materials and contoured waistbands, which most men's garments do not include," Gap spokesperson Debbie Felix told The Huffington Post in an email Tuesday.
"This higher price point reflects this selection of unique fabrics and design elements," she added. (Gap spokeswoman Liz Nunan gave an identical statement to BuzzFeed).
"This overtly discriminatory pricing policy indicates sexism and sizeism on the part of Old Navy that is unfair to women of size and unacceptable to me as a consumer of Old Navy's products," the Change.org petition says.
A look at Old Navy's website confirms that the company charges plus-size women more for the same item than the "regular" size, at least some of the time.
But for men, a pair of "Men's Premium Slim-Straight Jeans" is the same price whether or not you purchase the plus size.

Fast Food Marketing Targets Black Kidsreddit

New York City artist, Sally Davies, bought a Happy Meal six months ago on April 10, after observing and photographing it daily, the meal showed no sign of deccomposition. A McDonaldï¿½s spokesperson said, ï¿½This is nothing more than an outlandish claim and is completely false.ï¿½        AFP PHOTO/Karen BLEIER (Photo credit should read KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images)
Kids are a lucrative prize for the fast food industry: Studies have found that kids can form strong bonds with certain brands, and that those bonds can last for their entire lives.
A new study from Arizona State University has found that fast food restaurants more aggressively target certain kinds of children with marketing: specifically children living in middle-income neighborhoods, rural communities and majority black neighborhoods. The research will be published in the December edition of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
For the study, researchers from Arizona State University, the University of Illinois at Chicago and Barker Bi-Coastal Health Consultants, Inc., analyzed 6,716 fast food restaurants around the country. The researchers studied fast food chains with at least 20 restaurants, and did not distinguish between corporate-owned and franchised outfits.
The study looked at interior marketing tactics, like play areas and displays of meal toys, and exterior strategies, like posters of cartoon and movie characters and images of toys displayed outside the restaurants. The study did not analyze advertisements for children in the media, including tactics like TV commercials and digital ads.
The researchers found that one-fifth of the fast food restaurants they studied utilized the in-store child-directed marketing tactics they were looking for. And the stores that did were more likely to be located in certain communities: Fast food restaurants in predominantly black neighborhoods were about 67 percent more likely to use child-directed marketing than those in white neighborhoods. Additionally, restaurants in rural areas were 40 percent more likely to use these tactics than those in urban areas.
Fast food restaurants in poor neighborhoods only used child-directed marketing about 4 percent more than restaurants in high-income neighborhoods, the researchers found. But middle-income neighborhoods, defined as the 25th-75th percentile of median incomes, stuck out: Restaurants in those areas were 28 to 34 percent more likely to use interior and exterior marketing focused on children than restaurants in upper-income neighborhoods.
Chain restaurants were more than 6 times more likely to use these strategies than independent restaurants, the researchers found.
Fast food restaurants allocated roughly $700 million to market towards children and teens in 2009, Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, the lead researcher on the study and an associate professor of nutrition at Arizona State University, said in a press release about the research .
"Marketing food to children is of great concern not only because it affects their current consumption patterns, but also because it may affect their taste and preferences," Ohri-Vachaspati said. "We know that consumption of fast food in children may lead to obesity or poorer health, and that low income and minority children eat fast food more often."
While it may seem counterintuitive that researchers found more child-focused marketing in rural areas than in urban ones, Sriram Madhusoodanan, a spokesperson for Corporate Accountability International, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, told The Huffington Post that the "lack of access to fast food alternatives" in rural  and low-income areas drives fast food companies to enter the communities and market more intensively. Madhusoodanan's group pushes for fast food companies to be subject to tighter marketing and health standards.
Madhusoodanan drew a parallel between the tactics of fast food chains and tobacco companies.
"This really the same cradle-to-grave marketing strategy that tobacco used: Hook them early and hook them for life," said Madhusoodanan.
Over the last 30 years, childhood obesity has doubled and adolescent obesity has quadrupled. Forty percent of 12-to-19-year-olds eat at a fast food restaurant on any given day, according to a November 2012 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Start a Business - Not a Social Enterprisereddit
Socially-minded entrepreneurship is the latest humanitarian trend. Altruistic mavericks are pioneering products and services to fulfill previously unmet needs -- especially in developing nations -- changing the rules of agriculture, lighting, medicine, education and more.
For example, Reel Gardening improves agricultural access. The group manufactures fertilized paper strips that encase seeds at the correct depth and distance apart for optimal growth. The biodegradable strip is merely planted in the ground up to a dotted line - making it simple enough for even children to grow their own food.
Another is Wecyclers, which addresses the urban waste challenge in Lagos. The company employs a fleet of low-cost cargo bicycles to collect recycling in low-income areas, incentivizing families to recycle with redeemable cell-phone credits.
Millbug, which produces a low cost, solar-powered tablet, is another example. The founders' aim is to improve connectivity and information access in areas off the grid.
The trend is timely.
In a world of plenty, billions of people fail to meet their basic needs. For example, current levels of food production could feed the entire world one and a half times. But, according to the World Food Program, poor nutrition causes 45 percent of deaths in children under five. Poverty and inequality, not scarcity, are responsible for the inadequate distribution of basic goods and services.
Thankfully, socially minded entrepreneurs are making the global economy work for more people. These forgers take on challenges like providing quality medical treatment to residents of New Delhi slums or ensuring children in rural Malawi access high-quality education. The world needs these innovative pioneers to include those at the bottom of the economic pyramid.
However, unmet needs will not necessarily be fulfilled by "social enterprises". While there is not a firm consensus, most definitions of social enterprise require all of the following elements: a social mission or purpose; a sustainable business model; at least 50 percent of profits invested into the social purpose; and a democratic decision-making model that incorporates all community stakeholders.
The social enterprise model aims to free nonprofits from never-ending fundraising cycles, ensuring work continues independently of donors' whims. The model has some benefits. In theory, it allows entrepreneurs to raise capital at below market rates and provides longer time frames to earn returns. It also provides easy publicity and lower labor costs, as employees will work for a salutary mission below market rates.
However, if do-gooder entrepreneurs and innovators aim to have a lasting impact, they should consider skipping over the strict "social" in social enterprise.
Social enterprises' extremely complicated business models make survival difficult. Over half of new businesses simply trying to turn a profit fail. But in addition to earning profit, social enterprises must also reinvest in their identified social cause and democratically incorporate the demands of the communities in which they work. The additional requirements often strain social enterprises, hampering their chances of success.
Social enterprises also have a relatively more difficult time accessing finance than mainstream enterprises. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 's latest report on social entrepreneurship explains that social entrepreneurs are more likely to fail to gain access to finance because of the nature of their businesses. According to the report, the subsequently high costs of financing often sink social enterprises.
In addition, social enterprises have difficulty securing the important business of large companies. A seemingly trivial deal with a large company can go a long way for a small social enterprise. For example, if a social entrepreneur employs local women to make nut butter and he or she can get a multinational to purchase stock for their canteens, it might fully fund the enterprise.
But, unfortunately, private sector companies are reluctant to work with social enterprises because they do not fit neatly into any ideological or, more importantly, legal framework. Concerns about security and potential unreliability also impede large companies from doing business with social enterprises -- although, these concerns might also be relevant to small, relatively unestablished businesses.
Obviously, social innovation should not be discouraged. However, rather than spreading these important innovations through social enterprises, the new products and services should be implemented with more traditional business models to ensure their impacts have the best chance of being felt for the long-term and at scale.
"Business" might not be as sexy as "social entrepreneurship", but fervently social innovators and entrepreneurs will best achieve their goals by building a company that achieves good without tying its hands with the onerous requirements of a social enterprise.

How Ana Dutra fosters innovation at the Executives  Club of Chicago0
A. We can distinguish ourselves by bringing in the disruptive leaders, thinkers and ideas. For example, we brought in Anders Sorman-Nilsson, who is a futurist from Sweden and Australia. On Friday, in our women’s leadership breakfast, we will have a panel of female leaders in STEM who are doing things that are incredibly innovative. That’s a space we want to occupy more. Of course, innovating in our own business, there are more models than just the face-to-face luncheons and breakfasts that we want to explore. I can’t talk about it yet, but we have an initiative that we're kicking off this month.
Q. How will you address diversity?
A. Being a Latina executive myself — I was not born and raised in this country — I’m very in tune with the need for integration and welcoming Latinos, African-Americans, Asians or just people with different thinking and backgrounds. We opened our season bringing in Debra Lee, who is CEO of BET, the largest African-American-focused media network that is now part of Viacom.
Q. How else do you plan to diversify?
A. It has always come on three prongs: (1) how diverse our membership is, (2) how diverse our board is, so bringing more diversity leaders into the board, and (3) in the types of speakers and content.
Q. What have you seen that most enabled companies to innovate?
A. Tremendous focus on the type of culture they were nurturing. Those are cultures where they encourage responsible risk and reward people for doing that rather than the same old way, as well as the type of leaders they bring into the organization.
Q. How are you building an innovation culture? 
A. We just launched an innovation council. Their goal is to bring in innovative thinking and companies for sharing best practices. I keep counseling them to go above and beyond technology. Look at what they’re doing in science, distribution and supply chain, manufacturing and customer service.
We created a talent and leadership committee, providing the latest practices in leadership development and organizational design. We’re creating a food and beverage industry committee. Then we are launching a special-interest committee on health and wellness for how should companies invest in health and wellness in a way that will enhance productivity, increase engagement and reduce health-care costs. In my own staff, when I finish watching a presentation, I go back to them and say, “How does this impact our business? How we have done things so far, and what can we do differently and incorporate that moving forward?”
Q. What lesson shaped how you think today?
A. Have a plan but always be open to new ideas, insights, data and to different thinking from other people and be a confident leader but be humble enough to always be able to learn something from whomever you’re talking with. I always had my own personal advisory board, and I will always ask people to challenge me. It is an interesting and difficult but very powerful balance.
Q&As are edited for length and clarity.

How We Arrived At The Current State Of Our Politicsreddit
This post will take you all the way from the invention of the Tonight and Today shows through the dysfunction of modern politics. It's a bumpy ride, so please stow your tray table.
There used to be a thing called "mass media."  First magazines and newspapers, then radio, then television -- they all attempted to do the same thing: aggregate as large as possible an audience, and then sell it to advertisers. The larger the audience, the more advertisers would pay. It was a simple business: inform or entertain in bulk.
One of the early chief executives of network television was Sylvester (Pat) Weaver. At a time when no one really knew what the then-new medium could do, he thought up little things like The Today Show and The Tonight Show. Other little things he thought up, like a travel show called Wide Wide World and a monthly series of splashy entertainment events called " spectaculars, " didn't fare so well in the mass network environment.
Soon, Weaver was gone from NBC. He resurfaced a decade later in California with a new thing called "subscription television," or STV. It charged you a monthly fee and you saw what couldn't be seen on mass commercial television. Having started as an ad man, Weaver wasn't an anti-advertising radical; he just understood that there was a panoply of programming that would never fit the mass-audience aim of network "clients," and an audience, smaller but probably wealthier, that would pay to see it. To him, those offerings included full opera and concert performances, full-length plays, baseball games, children's programming, and current feature films. The latter part of the slate got him in trouble. The movie theater industry, fearing the competition, got a measure on the California ballot to outlaw STV. And, because markets, it passed .
I retell this history to make a point: Weaver's idea of pay TV was radically different from what we pay for now on cable, and that difference is crucial to the current state of our politics.
In search of efficiency, most advertisers increasingly became less enamored of the mass audience.   They wanted to talk only to whoever they thought was the most likely group of people to buy what they were selling. With the help of surveys, then focus groups, then barcodes, and soon cornea tracking, they were able to zoom in closer and closer on their chosen targets. And television, particularly ad-supported cable, started programming to fit that agenda. Advertisers wanted to reach men 18-34?  Women 24-47?  Tweeners? Here came networks specialized in aiming at those audiences. Aside from the Super Bowl and the Oscars, the old mass audience -- assembled to satisfy advertisers with the least specifically-targeted products, your Chevys, your toothpaste, your refrigerators -- rarely meets any more.
But targeting your audience is just the beginning. Now you must tailor your messages for that audience. More focus groups, more surveys, more corneas.
And, inexorably, as was predicted as early as Vance Packard's shrill but prescient " The Hidden Persauders ," advertising techniques migrated into the world of political communication. Politicians were convinced, by their consultants and "strategists" -- what consultants called themselves after "consultant" became a pejorative -- that they were wasting money communicating with voters unlikely to turn out or to vote for them. Targeting became more precise, and precision messaging followed. (And, then, the need for increasing amounts of money to run political campaigns -- because, among other reasons, those strategists tend to get paid the same way ad agencies do, by commissioning the ad buys. As in, the more advertising a campaign buys, the more the strategist gets paid. Pretty strategic, really.)
We've now arrived at the era of "feeding the base," telling the most likely voters what they've told consultants they most want to hear -- the clanging echo chamber that passes for modern American political discourse. Just as advertisers' wishes merged with (if not drove) technological change in the media universe, so in politics: speaking to the larger mass audience is a rare event, limited to special ceremonial occasions like inaugurations. The rest of the messaging is targeted, if not dog-whistled, to specific tranches of the desired constituency, sliced as finely as the mortgages (pre-2008) or the auto loans in modern financial "securities."
And, of course, we the people have been recruited as accomplices in the degradation of our political system. Every survey we complete, every exit pollster we talk to, feeds the data into the system that enables it to target us and craft messages to us ever more precisely. Our purported leaders, the sad bunch of pretty boys and girls (the old cliche, "politics is show business for ugly people" has now dropped its last three words), follow their advisers' advice as obediently as the would-have-been dramatists who now think up "reality" shows for TLC.
Those initials stand for (and stand in mocking tribute to) that cable network's original name: The Learning Channel. Somewhere, Pat Weaver must be laughing, sadly.

The New Normal: Gas Under $3Gas To Average Under $3 In 2015, Government Says

NEW YORK (AP) — The average price of gasoline will be below $3 a gallon in 2015, the government predicted Wednesday. If the sharply lower estimate holds true, U.S. consumers will save $61 billion on gas compared with this year.
In a monthly report, the Energy Department reduced its forecast for global oil prices next year by $18 a barrel to $83. Weakness in the global economy will crimp demand for oil, while production in places like the U.S. keeps rising.
The result: Drivers will pay $2.94 per gallon on average in 2015, 45 cents lower than this year. Based on expected gasoline consumption, that's a savings of $60.9 billion.
That may not seem like a lot in the context of a $17.5 trillion U.S. economy, but economists say it matters because it immediately gives consumers more money to spend on other things. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of the U.S. economy.
"It would be a reversal of the trend over the last few years where consumers can't stretch a dollar far enough," says Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo.
Quinlan says the price of gasoline is one of the three big drivers of consumer confidence, along with stock prices and the unemployment rate. "Lately all three are moving in the right direction," he says.
The average gasoline price in the U.S. has fallen for 48 straight days and is at its lowest point since December of 2010, according to AAA. That was also the last full year when the average came in below $3 a gallon.
Drivers are now paying $2.92 per gallon on average, AAA says. Late fall is often when the price of gas hits its low for the year. The government is now saying that these prices aren't just a low point, but instead will be the norm next year.
Adam Sieminski, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical arm, attributed the lower pump prices to lower prices for crude oil and weak fuel demand. The EIA did hedge its bet on lower oil prices though, as it cautioned that OPEC could cut production in order to push prices higher.
The global price of crude has fallen by $35 a barrel, or 30 percent, since late June and closed at $80.38 Wednesday.
Oil production around the world has been strong in recent years. A boom in the U.S. has pushed domestic production up 70 percent since 2008. At the same time, demand for fuels is growing more slowly than expected in Asia and Europe because of weak economic growth.
The U.S. economy is faring relatively well, but more fuel-efficient cars and changing driving habits are keeping domestic gasoline demand low. The EIA expects demand to fall slightly next year despite the lower pump prices.
The EIA also slightly lowered its prediction for growth in U.S. oil production because lower prices will force some drillers to cut back. Production is expected to reach 9.4 million barrels a day in 2015, down from a previous estimate of 9.5 million barrels per day. Still, that would be an increase of 4 percent over this year and the highest domestic crude production since 1972.

Warren Buffett Buys DuracellWarren Buffett Buys Duracell For $3 Billion

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Buying Duracell will provide a short-term charge for Warren Buffett's company, but the battery maker could eventually wind up being a drain on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as consumers increasingly rely on rechargeable batteries.
Duracell is being sold for roughly $3 billion because Procter & Gamble Co. doesn't consider it one of its top-performing consumer products companies.
"It's a declining business, which was dragging down the overall growth at Procter," said Joseph Agnese, who is an analyst for S&P Capital IQ. He said Duracell's disposable battery sales have been shrinking 2 to 4 percent per year.
Still, demand remains for the single-use batteries that power TV remotes, purring animated cats and many other electronic toys. And some experts say there is plenty of opportunity for Duracell if it can find ways to sell more rechargeables and tap into the market for large batteries used in vehicles and on the power grid.
With Berkshire Hathaway's vast resources, which included $62.4 billion cash at the end of September, and its 10 percent stake in Chinese carmaker BYD, it's tempting to think of this deal as a play on electric vehicles, said Jeff Chamberlain, who helps direct energy storage research at the Argonne National Laboratory.
"I can't help but hope that this is going to turn into something that will aim at the bigger picture," said Chamberlain, who is deputy director of development and demonstration at the lab.
The idea that Berkshire is buying Duracell to turn it into something else doesn't fit with Buffett's model of buying quality companies and allowing them to continue doing what they do best. He favors easy-to-understand businesses that have a strong competitive advantage.
"I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette," Buffett said in a statement on Thursday.
Duracell may already be pursuing new opportunities, however. Duracell has been developing lithium-ion batteries for some time, Chamberlain said, and it is a small player in the market for those rechargeable batteries.
Berkshire will hand over the P&G stock it already owns, which is worth about $4.7 billion, to acquire Duracell. Offsetting part of that price, P&G will contribute about $1.7 billion cash before the deal closes in the second half of next year.
Author and investor Jeff Matthews, who wrote "Warren Buffett's Successor: Who It Is and Why It Matters," said the deal is a tax-efficient way for Berkshire to sell its P&G stock and avoid capital gains taxes. Still, he's not a big fan of Duracell because of the overall shift to rechargeable batteries.
"I'd rather have the Procter & Gamble shares," Matthews said. "I think Procter & Gamble will get more valuable over time, and Duracell will get less valuable."
Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate already owns a number of well-known consumer brands in its portfolio of more than 80 businesses, including Fruit of the Loom, Geico insurance, Helzberg Diamonds and half of H.J. Heinz Co., the ketchup maker.
P&G, whose products include Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, has been trimming its product lineup to focus on its top performers. After it finishes jettisoning more than half its brands around the globe over the next year or two, P&G has said that it will be left with about 70 to 80 brands.
Berkshire has been a significant P&G shareholder since the consumer products firm acquired Gillette in 2005.
Cincinnati-based P&G said it will take a charge of about 28 cents per share in its current quarter related to the Duracell deal. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2015.

Doctor Arrested Over India Sterilization DeathsDoctor Who Conducted Botched Sterilization Procedures That Killed 13 In India Arrested
 | By                                                                By MUNEEZA NAQVI

Indian women who underwent sterilization surgeries receive treatment at the District Hospital in Bilaspur, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2014, after at least a dozen died and many others fell ill following similar surgery. The surgeon who performed the operations at the government-run "health camp" plowed through more than 80 tubectomies in six hours, a clear breach of government protocol, which prohibits surgeons from performing more than 30 sterilizations in
NEW DELHI (AP) — The doctor who conducted sterilization procedures after which 13 women died in central India was arrested, but insisted he didn't do anything wrong — even though he said he used to perform up to 10 times more surgeries a day than allowed.
Dr. R.K. Gupta, who had been hiding since Saturday's operations, was arrested at a relative's home near Bilaspur city late Wednesday, said Dr. S.K. Mandal, the chief medical officer of Chhattisgarh state.
Gupta denied responsibility for the deaths and blamed medication given to the women after the surgeries.
A total of 83 women had the surgeries as part of a free government-run mass sterilization campaign and were sent home that evening. But dozens became ill and were rushed in ambulances to private hospitals in Bilaspur.
Mandal said at least 13 women died and dozens more were hospitalized, including at least 16 who are fighting for their lives.
Gupta had performed the 83 surgeries in six hours — a clear breach of government protocol, which prohibits surgeons from performing more than 30 sterilizations in a day, Mandal said. He said investigators were also trying to determine whether the women, all of them poor villagers, had been given tainted medicines.
"I am not guilty. I have been performing surgeries for a long time and there has never been any problem," Gupta told reporters in Bilaspur around the time of his arrest.
"I have a history of completing up to 200-300 surgeries in one day," he said. "There are no written guidelines, but what we have been told verbally is that we shouldn't perform more than 30 operations in a day."
He said the patients began throwing up and complaining of dizziness and weakness after they were given medication following the operations.
Gupta has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, local Inspector General of Police Pawan Dev told the Press Trust of India news agency. If found guilty he would face a maximum punishment of life in prison.
Experts say the deaths are the result of a lack of medical oversight and because of sterilization targets set by the Indian government as part of its efforts to stabilize the country's booming population.
In the 1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a policy of forcibly sterilizing men who had already fathered two children. Opponents said the program targeted unmarried and poor men, with doctors given bonuses for operating on low-income patients.
India's government said it stopped setting targets for sterilizing women in the 1990s. But doctors and human rights workers have alleged for years that targets exist, which would lead to inevitable coercion in villages where most people have limited access to education and health care.
Mandal said earlier that Gupta was likely under pressure to achieve his district's target of about 15,000 sterilizations.
In January, Gupta was feted by the state government for performing 50,000 laparoscopic tubectomies.
Sterilizations continue to be the most popular method of birth control in India, with many women opting for them because a one-time operation can help them take charge of their fertility.
But incentives and government quotas cause doctors to pressure patients into surgery rather than advising them on other contraception options.
Women in most Indian states are promised 1,400 rupees ($23) when they choose to have laparoscopic, or "keyhole," sterilization surgeries like those conducted in Bilaspur. The procedure is one of the most commonly performed minimally invasive surgeries, and is usually done under a local anesthetic.
The relatives of some of the women who died said they were bullied into getting the surgery. Most of the women had very young babies, some of whom were still breastfeeding.
"I hope that he can never sleep in peace," said Sadhu, the husband of one woman who died after the operation. "The same thing should happen to him. Then he will know what it is like to lose someone in your family."
India has one of the world's highest rates of sterilizations among women, with about 37 percent undergoing such operations compared with 29 percent in China, according to the United Nations. About 4.6 million Indian women were sterilized in 2011 and 2012, according to the government.
In comparison, less than 1 percent of men choose to undergo vasectomies even though the cash incentive is higher at about 2,000 rupees ($33). Cultural taboos inhibit men from opting for the operation.

CHILPANCINGO, Mexico, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Demonstrators set  fire to the local legislature building on Wednesday in the  capital of the southwestern state of Guerrero  in protests over  the apparent massacre of 43 students by corrupt police and thugs  from drug gangs.
Violent demonstrations rocked several other states, where  protesters blocked an airport and damaged the local office of  President Enrique Pena Nieto's ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI).
In Guerrero's capital of Chilpancingo, members of a  teachers union set fire to the session hall in the state  assembly building while also torching several cars outside.
Firefighters extinguished the blaze and no injuries were  reported. Protesters also set a fire at administrative offices  of the state's education department.
Anger has intensified in Mexico since Attorney General Jesus  Murillo said last week that evidence suggests 43 missing trainee  teachers were murdered by gangsters, incinerated in a bonfire at a garbage dump and their ashes thrown in a river.
The students were abducted by corrupt police in September,  Murillo said.
The protests have led to mass cancellations this week in the  hotels of Acapulco, the famous beach resort, ahead of a long  holiday weekend. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters scuffled  with riot police and burned PRI offices in Chilpancingo.
"God willing, this type of vandalism does not repeat itself,  this is not the way," said resident Constantino Garcia. "I think  that this is not what society hopes for when demanding justice."
Tens of thousands of Mexicans have taken to the streets in   recent weeks in peaceful protests over the government's handling  of the case of the missing students, which has become the  biggest challenge yet to Pena Nieto.
The president is on a trip to China this week, which  infuriated protesters and relatives of the students. They  believe he cares more about Mexico's business interests than  trying to deal with the gang violence that has ravaged much of  the country for years.
In neighboring Michoacan state, which has also been a focal  point of drug gang violence, students blocked the main entrance  to the state capital's airport, a state police spokesman said.
Another group of demonstrators broke windows, furniture and  computers at local PRI offices in the capital of Morelia,  according to police.
Local media also showed images of masked people, purportedly  student teachers, looting trucks in the state of Oaxaca, while  another group took over a toll booth station in the state of  Chiapas and burned several cars.

Duck Dynasty  Musical Headed For Sin Cityreddit
" Duck Dynasty " is making the leap from the small screen to the stage, with reports that a musical based on the controversial family is headed to Las Vegas.
The musical, from the production company behind "Jersey Boys," will be a semi-biographical show based on Willie and Korie Robertson's book , "The Duck Commander Family: How Faith, Family, and Ducks Built a Dynasty," The Hollywood Reporter said.
The show will not star the Robertson family, but instead feature actors playing members of the family, the website reported.
The New York Times says the 90-minute, 14-song show will likely open in February at The Rio , which is currently home to Penn & Teller's live show as well as a Chippendales performance.
“ I think the expectation is that it’ll be all chicken-pickin’ stuff and banjos, but what we’re trying to do is pull out as much heart, humor and sincerity as we can to keep people surprised ,” Steven Morris, one of the show's composers, told the newspaper.
The Times also reports that anti-gay remarks from family patriarch Phil Robertson will be addressed in the show.
Robertson later issued an apology, but has continued to make controversial remarks. In June, he claimed he was " trying to help those poor souls and turn them to Jesus " and in September said he's as much of a homophobe as Jesus . He has also claimed that AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are God's "penalty" for immoral conduct .
“The Robertsons are so unusual, their story so juicy, and theater shouldn’t be limited to telling stories about people you resemble or revere," producer Michael David, who said he was personally offended by the comments, told the Times.
Season 7 of " Duck Dynasty " premieres next week on A&E.

Frances Prime Minister Knows Whats in a Namereddit
This is not the first time that Manuel Valls has proposed changing the name of the French Socialist Party.
Truth be told, he is doing it today a bit less clearly than he did the day after the defeat of Mrs Royal in France's 2007 presidential election. Less clearly, too, than in October of that same year, when, in a review of my book, Left in Dark Times, he urged his fellow party members to dig "deep into their history and into their name." And less clearly than in May 2009, when he earned a scolding from those who were then the party's pundits.
But that he has returned to the subject from the vantage point of his present position -- which is, like it or not, the head of the majority -- obviously gives his suggestion new weight. And this explains why the affair has provoked such an outcry from the guardians of the house of the dead, including, this past weekend, former prime minister Michel Rocard, the inventor of the "second Left," who appears now to have found common cause with communist Pierre Laurent, the leader of what remains of the "first Left," in attempting to bring the young and courageous prime minister to heel.
Valls is right, of course.
And for an essential reason handed down to us from the great nominalist tradition in philosophy.
Names are never just names.
The shadow of everyone who invented, bore, and defined a name stalks that name and sticks to its skin.
Every name has a history: the history of the battles waged in that name or to gain control of it, and of those fought in the arena it defined.
That being so, you have a choice.
Either you consider the outcome of the battle: You reason -- as is fitting on the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Wall -- that "good" socialism won out over bad socialism, the democratic strain over frozen authoritarianism, but in that case it does seem as if, stripped of its old adversary and freed from the great dilemmas that it had been called upon to arbitrate, the name has become hollow, a signifier that has lost its use and purpose, a word without meaning, an acronym, an ideogram spinning in a vacuum as if demagnetized.
Or you consider the history of the battle: This is how it is, you think, with the cells in a living body that still harbor the memory of a disease long after the disease has passed, memory that settles in the cells like sediment. In which case it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the name is haunted by too many evil spirits, weighed down or even overladen with too much foul, fossilized memory. You reason that, in this story of glory and infamy in which the worst and the best (in proportions not quite clear) came face to face, the worst simply looms too large to allow you to discern today the political form of the good, the vibrant, the unspoiled.
I recall Albert Camus' remark that, whatever happens, the very word "socialism" will abide like a burn in the mind of half of humanity.
I remember those Czech students at the University of Prague who, when Jean-Paul Sartre came to lend them his support in 1963, could not understand why he would cling to a doctrine that in their eyes had been fatally compromised on the granite tongues of tyrants.
I think back to those rebels whom we called dissidents, whose message was that a word that could be used to refer both to Sakharov and Brezhnev, to the heirs of Alexandra Kollontaï as well as to those of Joseph Stalin, a word that could represent (as if they were two branches of the same family) both the "solidarity of the shaken," in the phrase of Jan Patocka, and the suppression of a society under a shroud of state terror, a word that was never able to decide, so to speak, whether it was on the side of the yearning for freedom or of the will to despotism (and even of the desire for servitude) -- that word is forever lost to humanity.
Manuel Valls falls within that tradition.
He is a direct descendant of antitotalitarism, which, along with anticolonialism, is a pillar without which the European Left collapses and loses its bearings.
In rejecting a name that cannot cast off that criminal past (a past that, in the French case, encompasses both Jean Jaurès and the anti-Semitic Jules Guesde, both the strict ethics of Pierre Mendès France and the cynical opportunism of Guy Mollet) -- in jettisoning a signifier that has become a concentrate of the catastrophic equivocations of Mitterrandism, the costs of which have yet to be reckoned, Valls is attempting to cut the Gordian knot that has forced his fellow party members to choose between demagoguery when in the opposition and betrayal when in power.
The French Left can choose not to hear him.
The diehards can continue to pedal along idly like Alfred Jarry's bicyclist, who failed to realize that he was dead.
They can wave their wooden swords until the day the world discovers that, like Italo Calvino's knight, their armor is empty.
Or they can bet on the ideological New Deal that is being offered to them.
They can listen to the little bird telling them that what remains of the "republican spirit" and of the "ideal of emancipation" (the demand for which is clear in Valls's words, despite what his detractors say) can be saved only by bidding a very firm goodbye to the reactionary idea of socialism.
Once that is done much will become possible, beginning with the construction of a new political group that will allow the French Left to catch up with other European leftist parties, to leave behind, finally and forever, its interminable, sickening nineteenth century, and to reform, repair, and -- yes -- change the world.

7 Ways to Deal With Overwhelm in Your Companyreddit
According to a recent survey we conducted of 500 business owners, over 70 percent reported feeling "overwhelmed" running their companies. They felt pulled in too many directions, like they were wearing too many hats, with no time to take a breath and regroup.
Can you relate? Here are seven concrete tactics to deal with overwhelm in your company.  Pick one or two to immediately implement to bring some sanity and joy back into the process of growing your company.
1. Pick one "bottom line" for the day, and get it done by 10:30 a.m.
A bottom line is the one thing that if you did it today would have the biggest positive impact on helping your company reach its most important goals.  The best daily bottom lines take no more than 30-60 minutes (if you have an idea that would take longer, chunk it down into a smaller bite for that day.)
2. Start your day by knocking out your bottom line -- before you open your email.
We all intuitively know that email is disruptive, distracting, and addictive.  Yet too many business owners accept this and still start their day by visiting their inbox.  Not you, not anymore.  Give yourself the gift of the first 30-60 minutes of your day to knock out your bottom line for the day.  The power and momentum you'll carry into the rest of your day will help you regain a sense of control of your day.
3. Set aside one day per week as your "Focus Day".
A Focus Day is the one day per week that you set aside for you to invest on your highest value projects or activities.  To create value we need blocks of time, yet as business owners our time is increasingly fractured into smaller and smaller units.  Pick one day each week that you'll carve out a 3-5 hour block to work on your highest value stuff.  This may require you to turn off your email, or close your door (or to even leave your office altogether and work from a remote, distraction free location.)
4. Give yourself a break.
If you're taking one focus day per week (3-5 hours) and starting your non-Focus Days (i.e. your "Push Days" since they are about pushing things one step further down the field) by knocking out your daily bottom line (1/2-1 hour four days a week), then you're getting 5-10 upgraded hours per week of real, valuable work done each week.
So now cut yourself some slack.  Are working those two hours longer into the evening really going to help you get more value done, or are they just a compulsion to get more lower-value tasks off your plate?  Likely the later so give yourself a break and go home.  Or take a run.  Or play hooky for a few hours in the afternoon and stroll through the park.  The break will help you recharge and regain your sense of perspective.
5. Create a "Stop Doing" list, and add to it regularly.
Too many business owners live their lives based on a to-do list to which they keep adding more and more.  But rarely do they make the hard choices of what to let go of and what to delay.  Once a week scan through your to-do list and decide if some of the items on it would be better deleted, or to delay by adding them to your "revisit later" list with a date you'll review whether or not to pick the item backup, or to extend the delay period.
6. Narrow your focus to those fewer, better things that will truly make a difference.
Too many business people think the answer is more, but that just isn't so.  The answer is about better.  When you try to get too many things done you risk letting the good ideas drown out the great ones.  Remember, you have a limited amount of attentional units so invest them wisely.  Right now, focus on executing extremely well on one or two things, not skimming the surface of 12.
7. Each quarter, reduce your "fewer, better" focus to a one page plan of action for your company.
One page?  Yes!  You need to be able to see it all in one whole.  Pick the top 2-3 focus areas for your company this quarter.

Do What You Want Them to Do: Management Lessons from the Toddler Trenchesreddit
My toddler, 1 years old at the time, stumbled and fell.  Spectacularly.
He hadn't been walking or talking long; he wasn't yet great at either.  But I'd let him roam free in a hotel lobby to build confidence.  Why not let him stretch his wings in such a giant space with no easy exits?  But his wobble-walk failed him, and he fell hard on the stone floor.  And as his knees, palms and torso made contact in rapid succession, a tiny toy truck sailed from his left hand, bouncing ten feet across the marble.
I flew from behind.  A stranger collected his toy and approached from the front.  As we both reached him, my little guy stood up, his back to me, and faced the man who held his truck.
I couldn't see his face.  Would there be tears?  A pained scream?  A total meltdown?  Between the impact, and the sight of his favorite toy in a stranger's hand, this wouldn't be good.
The stranger tentatively handed over the toy, and my amazing tot said the one thing I least expected.
"TANK YOU, Sir!"
That's right, he thanked him and called him "sir."  The man grinned from ear to ear.  Neighboring parents watching the fall nearly broke into applause.  From behind a counter, a clerk whispered "wow."
For fifteen seconds, my kid was some sort of courteousness hero, and I basked in glory-by-proxy.  We must be great parents if he's so composed under pressure, and at only a year old, right?
Yeah, right.  I write about management, not parenting, because that's what I know.  Families are not organizations -- and, honestly, I'm mostly guessing in the Daddy role.  I won't know if my guesses are right for at least 20 years.  I may never know.
So, when the glory wore off, I found myself confused.  Never to that point had I directed him to "say thank you."  And honestly, I'm not a big fan of "sir" and "ma'am."  It all feels a little old school to me, and it's not something I'd demand, even of an older child.  At this age, the kid had just started talking intelligibly.  How much please, thank you, sir, and ma'am could I have required, even if I had been so inclined?
It hit me a few weeks later as I was guiding him toward my car.  I was holding his hand, pulling and coaxing him in one direction as he strained in another, when out of my mouth came a phrase I'd used in countless similar situations:
"Please, sir, come in this general direction.  Right this way.  Thank you, sir."
I wasn't just asking politely.  I was also dragging him by the arm in the direction of my car, as parents do.  But, while I did it, I called him "sir."  I said "please."  I said "thank you."  It was hardly a perfect scenario, and yet on this occasion and countless others I was role modeling language and behavior.  On further reflection, I realized that his mother and I say please and thank you to each other quite often, and we also say it to him when he gives us something -- even when it's something he doesn't really want to turn over.
We didn't teach him how to respond in the fall-and-drop-your-toy situation.  We didn't demand that he use certain words in certain interactions.  But, between us, we equipped him with language.  He did the rest.
Let's get back to what I understand:  Organizations.  You can't pre-define everyone's response to every possible contingency.  You can try, of course.  You can write long, arduous employee manuals that specify down to the word what your team is supposed to say.  You can create policies and procedures that dictate what your managers and leaders are supposed to value, think and do.  You can review these ad nauseam, monitor everyone and penalize deviations from the approved script.
Still, surprises happen.  Bad days happen.  Stumbles happen.  And no matter how comprehensive your controls or how necessary you believe them to be, they'll never approach the power of equipping your team with language and behavior by simply practicing it in front of them. If you want your employees to be output-focused, be output-focused with them.  If you want them to be kind but firm, be kind but firm.  If you want them to make clear decisions and stand by them, make clear decisions and stand by them.
If you want them to say "thank you" a lot, say "thank you" a lot.
Some argue against this approach.  With the best of intentions, they claim it's somehow disingenuous to thank people when you're telling them what to do.  You're the boss, right?  Just give the order and be done with it.  Others get too caught up in situational specifics.  "How can I role model politeness to customers," they'll ask, "when my employees never see me interacting with customers?"
With my kid, at least, neither argument holds water.  If his mother and I were in the habit of grabbing things from his hand without a word, how would he have known to thank the toy-bearing stranger?  Should I have staged a few spectacular, toy-flinging falls of my own in hotel lobbies to prepare him?  Maybe prepared something for him in PowerPoint?
Those arguments don't hold water in organizations, either.  If a manager is constantly complaining to his staff about customers, the staff will take the attitude and language to the customers themselves.  When that manager changes his language, and starts talking about things like "our great customers," slowly but surely that language will find its way to customers' ears too.
Imagine this:  In a stressful situation with a customer -- or with you -- a team member reaches blindfolded into a box of potential response cards.  Some say "courtesy," some say "I don't get paid enough for this," and some are too obscene to mention.  You don't control which card he picks, but you do influence what's in the box.
Contexts, situations and details matter significantly less than visibility and frequency.  The more instances of "thank you" that you've put in the box, the better your odds of a desirable outcome when he makes the draw.
Skew the odds in your favor!  Ask yourself:  In what direction are you skewing the responses of your own employees, peers and managers?  Are you role modeling the behaviors you'd like to see in them, or are you doing one thing and asking for another?  If you need to make a change, do so -- and then keep doing so.  By the time you realize the benefit of your correction, you'll probably have forgotten that you made it.
And, by that time, I'll have perfected my PowerPoint deck entitled "Graceful Recovery for 2-Year-Olds."  Now that he's older, I think he can handle a full day training program.

India-U.S. deal paves the way for global trade pactclimate change (politics)
Food security deadlock resolved ahead of WTO meet
Decks have been cleared for a possible global trade deal after India and the U.S agreed on the way forward to break the logjam in global trade negotiations. With the agreement in place, India is all set to move its proposal on food security before the WTO’s General Council at its next meeting scheduled for early December.
This proposal will seek to make open-ended the interim protection of a ‘peace clause’ that was agreed to at the Bali Ministerial last December.
The clause safeguards support prices for farmers against the WTO’s limits on agricultural subsidies. India was in danger of breaching these subsidy caps.
India wants to make sure that this protection would be available in perpetuity, should a permanent solution to the problem of the WTO agriculture subsidy caps not be found. Whether the Bali Declaration provides that the ‘peace clause’ could be available beyond 2017 was open to interpretation.
India’s right
Announcing that an agreement had been reached with the U.S, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday that the U.S had agreed that India’s right to protect its right to food security cannot be denied by the WTO, paving the way for removing the imperfections in the Bali Ministerial package.
U.S Trade Representative Michael Froman also released a statement which said the agreement with India reflected shared understandings regarding the WTO’s work on food security.
Sources on the Indian side indicated that the resolution was possible after an understanding was reached with the U.S that India’s subsidies are not trade-distorting and aimed at achieving food security. India, on the other hand, was able to reassure the U.S that it was not opposed to trade facilitation and in fact was on course to implement it.
Nirmala Sitharaman: we are moving towards a satisfactory resolution of the impasse at WTO; all our concerns being addressed favourably.
— Puja Mehra (@pujamehra) November 13, 2014
Clears way for TFAs
“The agreement announced today between the United States and India paves the way for full implementation of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), the first multilateral trade agreement to be concluded in the history of the WTO,” the U.S statement on the India-U.S. agreement on food subsidies said on Thursday.
At the WTO’s Ministerial Conference held in Bali last December, all its members, including the U.S and India, had agreed to a package of measures including a TFA and a commitment to find a permanent solution to the problematic agricultural subsidy caps. India’s position is that the WTO’s farm subsidies need to be updated as they are benchmarked to food prices of the 1980s.
Efforts to put the TFA in place were dealt a setback in July, when India refused to ratify, it raising concerns over the unsatisfactory progress on the WTO’s work on food security issues. The U.S statement said that delay has now been overcome with the agreement with India in place for moving forward with the full implementation of the Bali package.
“We supported the Bali Package but when subsequent developments belied that hope, India had no option but to seek a course correction,” the India statement said. It also said that the impasse at the WTO was now likely to end, opening the way for implementation of the TFA.
“We are extremely happy that India and the U.S have successfully resolved their differences relating to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes in the WTO in a manner that addresses our concerns,” the India statement said. The agreement will facilitate Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bilateral meetings at the ongoing G-20 summit in Brisbane.

Reinventing: Your Follow-Up and Follow Throughreddit
I see this all the time in my coaching business and mastermind groups.  My clients spend a lot of time on the pre-planning and on-site work -- for prospect presentations, trade shows, conferences, networking events and on and on.  Here's where they fall short: It's all about the follow-up people!
Woody Allen once said the key to success is in "showing up."  I think that's a fraction of what it takes to stand out, make a positive impression and/or seal the deal.
Don't get me wrong, showing up counts -- for a lot.  It's one of the most important things to do in our fast-paced, high-tech, low-touch world that matters.  Preparing for those face-to-face opportunities is also crucial and as the saying goes "luck is when preparation meets opportunity."  Getting ready or preparing for a face-to-face meeting is essential, as is knowing what to wear, what to bring and what to say.
So, here's my question: Why, after investing in preparing and showing up for an opportunity, would you drop the ball on the follow-up?  If you've succeeded in the first two steps (preparation and showing up) by all means complete the process and follow-up!  Recently, I had a client attend two tradeshows.  She collected business cards, made notes about what should be done after the conferences and guess what -- she's done nothing and four weeks have passed.
Her reasoning is simple and one myself and so many other small business owners can relate to -- lack of "bandwidth."  It's a lack of people to help enter the data in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, write the emails, deliver on promises of information that would be passed on after the conference, etc. Talk about a missed opportunity, people!
Allow me to help save you thousands of dollars and a ton of your time by suggesting you simply "pass" on these opportunities if you're not committed to the follow-up and follow-through.  If on the other hand, you are committed to the three phases of maximizing your time at these often critical networking opportunities, here are some suggestions on the final phase of follow-up.
1. Write notes on the back of business cards you collect to jog your memory about what you need to send or get back to this person on. It may even be a request to interview them for an article you're writing for your website, trade publication, etc.
2. Hire a virtual assistant versed in your CRM program if you don't have the staff to do so. You are only as good as your list my friends. Make notes on what you learned about the person and what action steps need to be taken when you return from the show.
3. Deliver on what you promised. If you said you'd send them something, refer them to someone, or share a resource -- do it.  It shows you have integrity and are interested in cultivating a meaningful business relationship for each of you.
4. Continue to keep in touch in meaningful ways -- regardless of whether or not you get an immediate response from them -- it's important to stay engaged. This can easily be input into your CRM program as a reminder to reach out again.  Ask them if they'd like to receive your e-zine (electronic newsletter), an article you just wrote, etc.  Be a resource, not a pest -- it's the best way for a relationship to grow.
So, remember folks - without the follow-up - nothing happens - almost guaranteed.

How to Prep Your Website for the 2014 Holiday Seasonreddit
With the holiday season quickly approaching, now is the time to take an in-depth look at your website and get it ready to perform during the most important time of year for online sales. Whether you are a B2B or B2C business, the holidays are the most important times of year to make sure your website is performing as well as it can be so that you don't miss out on the estimated 72.4 billion dollars of sales that will be made this season. Here are just a few ways you can get your website prepared for the holiday onslaught:
Make Sure You Are Optimized for Mobile
Many different experts have said this many times over the years, but a lot of businesses still haven't gotten the hint. If your website isn't optimized for mobile devices, you're likely going to miss out on a large percentage of potential sales that continues to grow every year. If you don't have one already, a responsive website is a great gift that you can give yourself now that will pay huge dividends for your business down the road. A responsive website for your brand helps mobile users have the same streamlined experience with website that your desktop users already enjoy. Putting a mobile-optimized function in place for your website allows mobile users to make a purchase right from their phone - making the buying process easier for them and helping to increase your online revenue during the holiday season.
Create Holiday-Focused Landing Pages
If you haven't started getting holiday-specific landing pages ready yet, now is definitely the time. Particularly if you're using paid digital marketing channels like Google's AdWords or Facebook's advertising options, having landing pages that reflect the holiday season will help drive traffic and revenue immensely. Getting everything ready to go weeks in advance can help you can make sure that landing pages are optimized to convert users and that you're getting the most out of your online advertising budget.
Start Creating Great Holiday Content
If content marketing is king, holiday content marketing is a king with a flowing cape and a sack full of toys. Creating holiday content for your website's blog like holiday-themed posts, infographics, or videos can help to generate tons of sales and traffic to your website. The further out in front of a holiday you can start this process, the more time and resources you're going to be able to dedicate to making the highest quality content possible. As a result, when you release the content right around the holiday season, you'll likely be able to drive more traffic and leads to your website than you would have if you started the process only a handful of days prior.
Learn From Last Year's Analytics
If your website has been around for some time, now is the time to look back at your analytics from last year to help inform what you do in the upcoming holiday season. Take the time to understand what types of traffic to your website performed the best, what kind of content people gravitated towards, and where resources were wasted. By doing this, you can create online marketing strategies for the coming year that are based on more than gut instinct. If you had great success last year with an email campaign or an infographic, replicating and updating those marketing strategies for the coming year is a pretty safe bet for success and certainly a better use of your resources than trying a marketing tactic that has already failed in the past.
Check Website Stability
The holiday season can be a season of great new sales opportunities and massive new sources of traffic for your website. However, if your website isn't able to handle all of the traffic without crashing, it can become a season of lost opportunities and low revenues. If you have a great new piece of content or a new product that people love that suddenly gets massive amounts of traffic because it is featured on a huge website or a viral post, you want to make sure that your website can handle traffic spikes and convert interested users. Don't wait until it's too late - test out how stable your website is now so that you can make appropriate upgrades to keep your website online through the thick and thin of the holiday season.
For Some Channels It's Already Too Late
Lots of brands know that the holiday season is one of the most important times of the year for their online business. What they fail to understand is that preparing for it only a few weeks in advance is not enough to make sure that they drive as many sales as possible. Things like conversion rate optimization (CRO) tests, PR, an active social media presence, and SEO are things you need to be doing year-round. If you're suddenly concentrating on these marketing channels only a few weeks before the holiday season begins, you're unlikely to see much benefit. However, by focusing on short-term marketing strategies that you can still optimize, you can still make sure your website is ready to convert sizable amounts of traffic during the holiday season.

5 Science-Based Sales Techniquesreddit
Do you have something to sell? It could be your business idea, your product or even yourself. In this lab chat I want to teach you how to sell anything to anyone using science!
My team and I have spent months researching for my body language in sales course and we came across some fascinating science on selling. Here are our favorite tips:
1. Start With a Bang
Always start with a bang. One study tried to figure out how to increase room service tips for waiters in hotels. They found there was a super easy thing waiters could to increase their tips. All they had to do was start with a positive comment. When hotel guests opened their door, waiters said "good morning" and gave a positive weather forecast for the day. Just that one positive comment increased their tips by 27 percent!
How does this help you? Never start a sales meeting or pitch by talking about bad weather, traffic or being busy. Always begin with a positive comment or anecdote. Great weather, fun weekend plans or a favorite sports team winning a game. That gets you off onto the right foot.
2. Don't Self-Sabotage
The biggest self-sabotage mistake is to speak ill of a competitor. Research has found something called Spontaneous Trait Transference . They found that whenever you say bad things about someone else people can't help but put those same traits on you. The brain can't help but associate your gossip with you, even if logically we know you are talking about another person. If you say your competitor is low-quality and unreliable, your potential client can't help but associate those traits with you. No matter what, when it comes to gossip, always say "no comment".
3. Use Awesome Labels
When you assign someone a positive label, like having high intelligence or being a good person, that actually cues them up to live up to that label. In one study about fundraising , the researchers told average donors that they were in fact among the highest donors. Can you guess what happened? Those donors then did in fact donate above average. We live up to our positive labels. When you are with a client or potential customer give them genuinely good labels -- I never want you to be fake or manipulative. So be sure to stick to positive truths. You can say, "You are one of our best customers" or "You're such a pleasure to do business with". In that way, they will actually want to be one of your best customers and try even harder to be a pleasure to do business with.
4. Use Your Body
Study after study shows that you have to use nonverbal communication to be an effective salesperson. In one study, Sales people who used power body language increased their sales numbers by 56 percent after only one training. Power body language is super easy to learn. Check out this video to see what I mean.
5. End High
Lastly, end on a high note. Ok, let me explain a really gross, but fascinating study involving one of my least favorite topics: colonoscopies...I've only ever heard one thing about colonoscopies. They are super unpleasant. And doctors know that they have a bad rap. They wanted to do research to find a way to give colonoscopies a better reputation. A little background: a colonoscopy is only a few minutes long, but they are pretty uncomfortable. They found that if they added one minute at the end of the procedure that was pain-free, people remembered the whole experience as more pleasant. In other words, even if it takes a bit longer, ending on a better note makes someone recall the entire experience better. Before someone leaves your pitch, end on a high note. Gift a final perk, offer them a mint, pay them a compliment. It will make the entire time with you even better.
Sales is about getting authentic buy in. Its about showcasing your best self, product or service. Using science is a unique way to get someone's attention.

Major LGBT Advocates Who Had Previously Buried the Lede Come Out of the Closet -- Except Onereddit
As I enter my third year of blogging on The Huffington Post, I would like to return to the post that generated the most debate and heat in the first two years. That post, from last September, " Burying the Lede: The LGBT Community's Deafening Silence on Federal Transgender Employment Protections ," provided in-depth background about the Macy v. Holder case, the most momentous federal trans-rights advance in our history, and the community silence that followed. It struck a chord.
Today, thanks to the sterling reportage of BuzzFeed journalist Chris Geidner, we have reached a notable moment in movement history. Commissioner Chai Feldblum of the EEOC, the motive force behind the Macy decision, has spoken out publicly, and both the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) have now publicly stated their recognition of the significance of federal coverage of trans persons under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
Fred Sainz, Vice President for Communications for HRC, said, "Both the Macy v. Holder EEOC decision and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) Directive 2014-2 have provided real, immediate remedies for transgender workers."
Mara Keisling, Executive Director of NCTE, added, "We strongly believe job discrimination against trans people is illegal everywhere in this country under Title VII."
No lede being buried this time.
What prompted this coming out from HRC and NCTE? Several weeks ago the National LGBTQ Task Force, coincident with the organization's renaming and "Be You" campaign, published several graphics that denied the reality of the Title VII protections brought about by the Macy decision and the subsequent actions taken by the EEOC and legal advocates on behalf of clients. There was no vagueness, dancing on the head of a pin or splitting hairs on the legalese as many organizations have done since the Macy decision. No, the statement was stark:
"There are NO FEDERAL PROTECTIONS for employment non-discrimination."
Asked by me to clarify, Kylar Broadus, who had replaced Lisa Mottet at the Transgender Civil Rights Project of the Task Force, said:
The Task Force follows the Macy decision rendered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) which is an administrative agency and not a court of law. EEOC rulings are used as guidance by courts of law in most instances. Courts aren't bound by EEOC rulings but usually give great deference to them. Court decisions rendered by appeals courts become law. A case has to be brought to win or set precedent in a particular circuit which is why there is still need for a federal statute protecting workers.
An uninformed trans person, upon visiting the website or Facebook page of the Task Force, driven there by the organization's four-decades-long history of cutting-edge LGBT activism, including being the first national advocacy organization to embrace the trans community by setting up the Transgender Civil Rights Project in 2001, would leave feeling deflated and alone in the face of employment discrimination. If she didn't live in a state, city or county with explicit protections -- many of them thanks to the decade of work by Lisa Mottet, a former student of Professor Feldblum's, and her staff at the Task Force -- she would simply resign herself to the reality of discrimination.
To prevent that, I have been hammering away at the new reality post-Macy. With the help of colleagues at Freedom to Work and the Transgender Law Center (TLC), as well as trans activist and icon Riki Wilchins of True Child, trans attorney and Lambda Legal board member Jillian Weiss and Gender Rights Maryland board chair Sharon Brackett, we published a brochure available on the TLC website explaining those protections. We've talked about them around the country, doing our best, with no resources, to educate the community. But without the clout of the HRC, NCTE and Task Force, our reach was limited.
I ran into resistance speaking with the national media, as Task Force attorneys undercut my message to the community about Macy.  One example occurred shortly after the decision, when Julie Turkewitz of The Atlantic, to whom I had spoken for 90 minutes about Macy at a trans conference, rewrote her work because she'd gone to the Task Force for a second opinion. What should have been "Title VII now covers transgender workers in all 50 states" was reduced to "While the decision applies only to federal employees...."
Members of the administration, including some at the EEOC, were perplexed by the silence on the issue, the vacuum at the top of the national advocacy community. This bewilderment began over two years ago but has increased since President Obama's long-awaited signing of Executive Order 13672 covering the federal-contractor workspace this past July, and the subsequent actions of the Labor Department to finally work proactively to protect trans workers under the Macy decision. Why, particularly with the end of any action on the Employment Non-discrimination Act (ENDA) for the foreseeable future, would the community surrender its one and only yet golden weapon for workplace protections? Why couldn't the community take "yes" for an answer?
I still don't know, though I've heard many explanations, the most common being that pushing cases under Title VII will likely lead to adverse federal court decisions, or that nothing is settled until the Supreme Court rules. Some think court losses from more than a decade ago are still determinative. None of these fears makes any sense, because if you don't use your rights, they will never be tested, and who would be better off not even trying? Yet, as Geidner points out, there have been multiple cases since 2012, and the community has won almost all of them. The EEOC has exhorted the trans community to file suit; could we have a more important cheerleader? And as the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (covering Alabama, Georgia and Florida) pointed out in the Glenn v. Brumby et al. case of 2011, which Vandy Beth Glenn won on 14th Amendment considerations pre-Macy (emphasis mine):
[S]ince the decision in Price Waterhouse, federal courts have recognized with near-total uniformity that "the approach in Holloway, Sommers, and Ulane ... has been eviscerated" by Price Waterhouse's holding that "Title VII's reference to 'sex' encompasses both the biological differences between men and women, and gender discrimination, that is, discrimination based on a failure to conform to stereotypical gender norms.
This week Commissioner Feldblum spoke out against the Task Force's messaging:
But [the Task Force statement] is incomplete -- both as a legal and practical matter. It fails to capture the reality that the EEOC currently helps thousands of individuals each year get recourse (& remedies) for their discrimination claims, without ever going to court. And they get that through the legal system set up for administrative relief via the EEOC. And that is what our 53 EEOC offices across the country are now doing right now for LGBT people under our Title VII jurisdiction. Thus, there are practical remedies being achieved through the administrative system right now in every state in the country.
To begin where I started, that doesn't mean an explicit federal law is unnecessary. To the contrary, it would be hugely helpful. It's just important not to downplay the real practical protection that exists now.
The commissioner's public statements prodded the HRC and NCTE statements, so now I can truly hope that the words of Tico Almeida , Executive Director of Freedom to Work and a long-time proponent of the value of the Macy decision, will be heeded:
I would like to see the big national LGBT organizations use their ample budgets on a public education campaign to promote the historic nature of the Macy decision so that more LGBT Americans will know that the EEOC is open for business and willing to help.
Until we get an ENDA with explicit protections or, better yet, an omnibus civil-rights bill that comprehensively protects the entire LGBT community, we need to make the most of what we have, and with a little luck Title VII may soon cover sexual orientation to the same degree that it now covers gender identity and expression.
As many of us have long said, it's good to be out of the closet, once and for all. The Task Force should join us and enjoy the sunshine.

Video Game Industry Adds Billions to US Economyreddit
Known more for remarkable advancements in technology and innovation than for jobs and commerce, the computer and video game industry is proving to be a bright spot in a slowly-improving American economy. According to a new report, " Video Games in the 21st Century: The 2014 Report ," released by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) this week, the industry added more than $6.2 billion to the U.S. economy in 2012. Approximately 146,000 individuals are directly and indirectly employed by the video game industry.
The new report reinforces the growing role video games play in our economy. Our industry drives technological and societal advancements that help Americans lead healthier, happier and more productive lives. It is also one of the nation's fastest growing sectors, providing tens of thousands of high-paying jobs to hardworking Americans across the country. Here are four examples of why games are such an economic powerhouse:
The video game industry outperformed the U.S. economy by more than four times. Video games are a 21.5 billion industry in the U.S. The industry significantly outpaced the overall economy from 2009 to 2012, growing more than nine percent compared to the U.S. economy's 2.4 percent.
Game developers and publishers expanded while other industries contracted. Employment in video games grew at an annual rate of nine percent from 2009 to 2012. For comparison, a number of U.S. industries, such as newspaper production and aerospace manufacturing, either lost jobs or increased them by less than one percent over the same period. In fact, employment at computer and video game companies grew more than 13 times the growth of the U.S. labor market (nine percent vs. 0.72 percent, respectively).
The industry's job market is spreading across the country. While California continues to rank first in terms of having the most video game industry personnel in the nation, its share of total industry employment remained essentially flat from 41.27 percent in 2009 to 41.40 percent in 2012. This slow growth stems in part from aggressive efforts by other states to lure high-paying, digital economy jobs with robust tax incentives. Today, 21 states and Puerto Rico offer digital media incentives. The seven states with the greatest number of entertainment software industry employees -- California, Texas, Washington, New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Illinois -- collectively employ 32,652 workers; nearly 80 percent of the total direct employment for the U.S. video game industry.
Compensation continues to rise. Employees in the computer and video game industry earned an average of 94,747 in 2012, up from90,000 in 2010. In comparison, the average U.S. household income in 2012 was 51,759.
With more people enjoying video games around the globe through consoles and mobile game play, the industry shows little sign of slowing down. Curious about how well your state stacks up against the rest? Read the individual state reports to learn more. Interested in working in the industry, but not sure how to get started? Check out my take on the nearly 400 higher education institutions that offer video game design programs.

Without Freedom There Is No Free Tradereddit
Trade agreements are often promoted as a means to keep prices down and employment up. The matter, as one might expect, is not so straightforward especially when political freedom is not part of the equation.
The Singapore experience with free trade agreements is, perhaps, instructive. For years, human rights in the city-state have been dirty words, it was taboo to speak of them.
This has not, however, stopped Western leaders, both in the economic and political spheres, from continuing to disregard the lack of democracy and the abuse of human rights in Singapore in favor of trade and commerce.
In 2003, Singapore signed a trade pact with the US. At that time, the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) was touted as a job creator and that the world needed more, not less, free trade. The US Ambassador to Singapore at that time said that as many as 50,000 jobs would be created in Singapore by the trade pact.
I wasn't so sanguine. Without clauses to guarantee human rights and rights of Singapore's workers, the agreement would just help the business elite in the US and Singapore to exploit cheap labour. And I said so when I visited the US then. Of course, given the might of the corporate interests, I couldn't get in a word edgewise.
That was in 2003. Ten years have since passed and the results are in:
According to the International Labor Organization, Singaporean workers have worked more hours than in most countries , and, perhaps unsurprisingly it has resulted in the workforce being the unhappiest in the world .
Income inequality in Singapore is higher than that in the US. While the city-state has the highest proportion of millionaires in the world, nearly 5 percent of its workforce have an annual income of less than US$5,000.
Despite the Economist Intelligence Unit ranking Singapore as the most expensive city in the world, there is no minimum wage law in the country.
It's not just the lower-income workers who are getting pounded. A recent study showed that almost 50 percent of Singaporeans subsist from paycheck to paycheck .
We have a pension savings system that is broken. An entire generation of workers is in danger of not having sufficient income to retire on.
As for the younger generation, there is significant underemployment and limited opportunities for graduates.
The rich in Singapore, in contrast, have never had it so good. The island, out of 23 economies, ranks 5th on the Crony-Capitalism Index compiled by The Economist.
It is clear that the benefits of the USSFTA have not accrued equitably. One reason for such a skewed outcome, at least for Singaporeans, is, as I've mentioned at the outset, the lack of democratic rights of the people.
The labour movement is under firm state guidance (the umbrella National Trade Unions Congress is headed by a cabinet minister), the print and broadcast media are owned by the government (Singapore ranks 150th out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom index -- even Myanmar is higher at 145th), the ranks of the political opposition and civil society have been decimated through decades of state harassment, and fundamental freedoms of speech, assembly and association are severely proscribed.
More free trade in the pipeline
The European Union (EU) is about to sign its own FTA with Singapore. The proposed agreement makes extensive provisions for the protection of the rights of businesses, but almost nothing in it speaks of the protection of the rights of workers.
The US has also embarked on the expansive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which seeks to, among other things, "support the creation and retention of jobs."
I understand the importance of trade. Without it, modern world comes to a standstill. I also understand that in an imperfect world, no one expects perfect equality.
However, extremes in income inequality does not conduce to society's well-being. Without freedom there can be no free trade; without democracy there can be no workers rights' and without workers' rights, FTAs are only tools for exploitation.
If we are going to ensure that trade remains sustainable, then we must strive to make trade pacts beneficial for all -- from the lowliest worker to the mightiest CEO. For this to happen, free trade agreements cannot continue to ignore human rights.

Write Your Way to Successreddit
source: IStock
Writing is a secret success weapon that's often overlooked. Becoming a consistent writer, recording your thoughts in a journal, can bring many benefits. Regardless of your occupation or what kind of business you run, writing can help you succeed in many ways. When you think of some of the most popular books of our time, they are often written by successful business owners and visionaries who had a habit of writing.
Even if you aren't going to write the next New York Times best seller, you should develop the habit of writing. There's tremendous power in penning your thoughts, ideas and strategies. There are many different forms of writing, but all of them lead down the path to success. At the very least, you should be writing down what you really want. Why? Because what's written is real. When you keep your desires just floating around in your head, you can't go anywhere with them. When your vision is written down, you can then run with it and move yourself closer to goal achievement.
Writing about your business vision and goals will help you to clarify and expand on them. You have to see the future of your business clearly before you can attain it. The more you practice writing, the more it will become a habit and something that you begin to truly enjoy and carve out time for. Enjoy the writing process and the personal development that comes with it. Here are some ways that you can write your way to success.
Write out your morning meditations. Meditation is the practice of visualizing your best possible outcome and seeing it in your mind's eye. During this time each morning --even if it's just for a few minutes -- take out your journal and begin to write out what you are meditating on. Doing this will make the vision even more concrete and add more detail to your visualization -- which in turn can speed up manifestation!
Write and reflect on your progress. You must retreat in order to advance. Take time to retreat and reflect. Pen your insights and lessons learned. Evaluate your daily habits and actions, then write down what is working and what is not. If you spend time writing your progress often, you will have a wonderful record of where you've been and what you've done. This will help you determine your next move and bring clarity to your future.
Write gratitude lists. Practicing gratitude is vitally important to your contentment on your success journey. The best way to do this is by regularly writing down what you are thankful for. Each night, think back through your day and write everything you are grateful for; every victory, whether big or small. Doing this will heighten your awareness to all the good things that are happening in your life and business -- and when you are focused on the good, you will attract more of it.
Use writing to brainstorm and write solutions to problems. One of the best ways to problem-solve is by writing. When you are faced with a problem or a decision, writing can bring a quick resolution. When you are looking for answers, write down questions. For example, if you need to come up with $5,000 in two days, write, "Where is my five thousand dollars?" Phrasing the question in this way opens you up to possibility thinking. Write down all possible ideas and solutions for your situation. Include everything that comes to mind and don't omit anything. When you are done, meditate on what you've written and then walk away from it. You will find that the answers will come quickly.
Use Success Stickies to write encouraging notes and affirmations to yourself. Writing doesn't always have to mean several pages in a notebook or journal. You can write your way to success simply by jotting notes, too. Success Stickies are a great way to reinforce your top goals, see your affirmations and encourage yourself by posting them up in your work space. Even a simple note such as, "Yes! Five more clients!" or "I did it! I always win!" is a great thing to jot down and put before you so you are seeing it every day.
Write your goals. This should be on your must-write list. Because what's written is real, the more you write, the greater the likelihood of it coming to fruition. When done in the right way, goal-writing is powerful and gets real results. A Harvard Business School study showed that graduates who had clear, written goals earned 10 times more than their counterparts. Goal Cards are a great resource to guide you through writing clear, specific goals. It then becomes an affirmation that you can say daily.
Journalize. This is such a huge topic in itself, that I created an entire course for it. Many of the writing suggestions mentioned here can be kept and recorded in a journal. Journalizing is so much more than just keeping a diary in which you record your life events and feelings. If you know how to journalize effectively, it can bring you increase. This is a powerful success attraction tool that only the top echelon practice. However if you learn the many strategic ways to journalize, you can join them and grow your business exponentially.

Word Mongering: How Not to Get Anything Writtenreddit
Several years ago, while working with a client -- who shall remain nameless to protect the not-so-innocent -- I found myself stuck in word-mongering hell.  We were drafting an op-ed piece for a major metropolitan daily about a timely subject.  Rather than focusing on big issues like content, the client kept making minor changes, like replacing the word "use" with "utilize." The back-and-forth was maddening -- a slow death by a thousand paper cuts.  By the time we finished "editing" the op-ed piece, we had missed our window of opportunity. All that time and effort was wasted.
Word-mongering, as I like to call it, is the practice of editorial mastication.  All too often this is called wordsmithing, which actually refers to someone who has specific skill with words.  Word-mongering, on the other hand, is a nagging talent aimed at avoidance.  Whether it's for a memo, an editorial piece, or an internal report, good writing involves putting a stake in the ground to state a position in the clearest and most compelling way possible.
When people spend hours and hours playing with the red pen or the edit function in Word, it's often because they don't want to own a particular direction or point of view, one which may be posited by another person or group entirely. The continuous updates offer a way to avoid dealing with the real issues that involve true intellectual wrestling over a position or opinion.  Word-mongering can also be a way to exert control, to make sure that the persons doing the editing leave their stamp.
To be sure, editing and proofing written documents is crucial, because it's tough to edit your own work.  And when that editing is constructive, it can make a document so much better.   But when you find yourself on draft 14, changing "the" to "a," you are probably in trouble.
How do you avoid being a word-monger?
Check facts.
Do the changes you are making correct inaccuracies or bad information?  If not, think twice before you keystroke.
Seek meaning.
Ask yourself if the sentences you want to change are unclear or hard to understand.  If so, change may be warranted. If the thought is clear, but just not the way you would say it, leave it alone.
Test vocabulary.
Do you feel compelled to replace a simple word with a jargon-y one? Or did you just feel the need to add syllables? If the meaning is clear, resist.
Examine intent.
Take a hard look at what the writer really wants to say and why.  Does the edit you want to make enhance the meaning?  Would the edit you make clarify the writer's attitude or cloud it?
Listen to the voice.
Here's the tough part.  Being a good editor means to listen to the voice -- not in your head -- but in the writer's head.  What is she or he trying to say and did they articulate it in language that can be understood? Even if you think your word choice or phrasing order might be more powerful or compelling, are you simply trying to make your mark?
Commit.
Have something to contribute?  Make the change and leave it alone.  Nothing wastes more energy and angst than a back-and-forth comment-by-comment set of blows over issues like starting a sentence with "and."
Being a good editor takes skill and attention to detail. Being a great editor adds a substantial dollop of discretion.  Let's leave the word-mongering to the amateurs.

Achieving Presentation Zenreddit
One quality that we value at Grupo Salinas is being fast and simple. In a globalized world, rapid response is key and simplicity is a necessary condition to achieve speed. But simplicity has value in itself. Simplifying complexities is a sign of useful intelligence.
In our group of over 100,000 employees in more than nine countries, developing communication skills is essential.
I have recommended in the past several books on the subject. One of them is Slide:ology, by Nancy Duarte, who gives tips for effectively developing ideas in a presentation. In the world of business, a good presentation opens doors, while a poor one   can do exactly the opposite.
Another interesting book on the subject is Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds, who discusses simple principles of Japanese design that can improve presentations.
He says: if we open our eyes and are willing to think differently, we see that there are design lessons all around us. Balance, harmony, moderation, simplicity and naturalness. These are some of the principles behind Japanese culture. Design does matter.
Reynolds, who is a professor of marketing and design in Japan, has become an expert in the quest for simplicity and harmony in design, applying the principles of Kaizen, a continuous improvement philosophy that we embrace at Grupo Salinas.
Here are a few concepts worth noting:
Be clear and simple. Many people avoid simplicity because it is often associated with something being poorly done, when in fact, it is quite the opposite. Simplicity eliminates elements that hide the essentials. Unless you learn to synthesize, tasks will take longer, cost more, and be less effective.
Start without prejudices. Adopt a beginner's mind. In the expert's mind, there are few possibilities; however, the world is completely open for the beginner's mind. Someone may have extensive knowledge in what he or she does, buy they should take a step back to resolve the problem as a child would, without preconceived ideas.
Resolve problems. The usefulness of design, at its most basic level, is finding the solution to a problem. Having a better understanding of the key fundamentals of design makes things simpler for us and our audience.
Capture attention. To achieve a successful presentation, you need to capture the attention of the public in less than 60 seconds, by doing something memorable and dramatic, such as relating a personal anecdote or explaining an unusual idea, to bring the audience where you want them to be for the remainder of the presentation. Tell stories, don't show slides.
Tell a story with pictures. Designing messages that include images is highly effective in attracting the attention of the public as well as helping them understand and remember main ideas.
Give each item the necessary space. Use blank spaces in your displays. One of the most common mistakes is to saturate space with text and images, when in fact blank spaces are powerful amplifiers that help create a whole, in addition to contributing clarity, beauty, meaning, calm, focus, and cleansing.
Less is more. And even less is even more. The time it takes audiences to look at a screen is time they will not be looking at you (the most important element of a presentation). Most people cannot understand text on a screen while listening to a person.
Use color sparingly. Color is one of the most powerful stimuli. It attracts our attention and affects us emotionally. Use color rationally; it can be used to call attention to something, to direct the audience's eye, to categorize, organize, create unity, evoke emotions, and set a mood.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is important to seek harmony between the elements of your presentation to achieve the consistency of the whole and the perception that each of the points is connected and part of the same message.
Seek continual improvement. Kaizen requires a commitment and willingness to change, as well as a long-term outlook that seeks education and growth through small changes.
In the end, it's all about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful, always with an open mind and taking into account your audience. Limits are great allies because they lead you to resolve creatively and ingeniously.
Remember that design matters.
Let your ideas go far.

5 Tips for Launching Holiday Social Media Campaignsreddit
During the holidays, brands try to get consumers' attention more than ever. As one of the biggest shopping times of the year, sending out the right message to the right people is key.
The tips below will help businesses make the most of social media marketing and advertising during the upcoming holiday season.
Highlight Popular Items
We're in an age of curated content and list posts. People are drawn to titles like "Top 15 Gifts Mom Will Love," so use that knowledge to your advantage.
Write blog posts or create social media posts that highlight popular items or bestsellers. Consumers trust what large groups of people like, and it becomes a type of social proof.
World Market has used this concept to its benefit, and on the front page of their website they display a list of the items most commonly pinned from their online shop.
Whether it's Pinterest or another platform, it's a great idea to show buyers in a hurry what the best of the best of your products and services are.
Host a Contest or Giveaway
Giving back during a time of mass consumption will definitely get attention. Everyone wants something free -- especially if it can potentially be re-gifted...
Look at Starbucks. Users who tag a photo of their red holiday Starbucks cup on Instagram with the designated hashtag are entered to win a limited edition Starbucks card.
The key words there are "limited edition." Status is a great motivator when it comes to giveaways, so keep that in mind when crafting holiday giveaways this season.
Schedule Blog Posts Early
Many businesses forget that the best place they can post content online is their own website or blog. By sharing one of those "top gift idea" posts on the blog weeks in advance, companies can help boost traffic by helping their posts pop up in search first.
There's no guarantee blog posts will make it on the first page of search results, but posting holiday-themed posts with frequently searched for titles (use Google's Keyword Planner ) will definitely help boost traffic.
Tech Times posted a toys gift guide in September:
Plan to Have Backup
The season of giving doubles as the season of returns, so be prepared. Whether it's products or services, staff your holiday customer service teams appropriately.
People will have more questions and more complaints than normal during the holidays. Consider when the busy times may occur (Black Friday? Christmas Eve?) and discuss response protocol and standard messaging with staff.
JetBlue's level of service is what all businesses should aspire to. Claiming an average 10-minute response time , the airline dominates customer service on social media.
Be Respectful the Actual Day
In all the marketing and giveaways and advertising, on the day-of take a break from being promotional. It's about fun and family, so wishing fans and followers a simple "happy [specific] holiday" is perfect.

How the Supreme Court Could and Should Be the Key to Federal Climate Actionreddit
Our Constitution was established to "promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity." And yet, our government persists with a business-as-usual path, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus that continued carbon emissions threaten the climate system on which civilization and nature as we know it depend.
In our view, the climate crisis cannot effectively be addressed by weak regulatory action and feeble statements of intent -- such as those recently announced by the U.S. and China -- while we maintain our present massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. We need a new approach, one grounded in government's fundamental duty to safeguard essential natural resources in trust for our children and those yet to be born.
The idea that essential resources, such as the "air, running water [and] the sea," are held in "common to all mankind," stems at least from the sixth century code of ancient Rome.  Blackstone, writing in his Commentaries on the Law of England, brought it forward to the 18th Century, noting that, notwithstanding developments in property law, certain resources must "unavoidably remain in common [including] the elements of light, air, and water."
Our Supreme Court has also recognized the public trust doctrine, both as a limitation on government action and a source of its affirmative duty. In 1892 it held, for example, that government may not fully sell off public resources and so deprive future legislatures of their authority to provide for the people. Neither may government mismanage resources that it holds in trust for the people as part of the public domain.
But no one has raised to the Court the question whether, by its failure to ensure that carbon emissions are reduced, our federal government is in violation of its fundamental public trust obligation. Until now.
Last month climate activists representing the interests of young children and others submitted to the Court a petition for certiorari seeking review of a 2013 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court.  That Court held that the public trust doctrine applies to states, but not to the federal government.  In our view, that simply cannot be correct. The federal government not only is vested with inherent authority to protect essential natural resources, it is also uniquely situated to protect resources in which the nation as a whole retains an interest. That includes, prominently, the atmosphere.
Accordingly, climate scientists led by one of us (Hansen) have now filed a "Friend of the Court" brief urging the Supreme Court to decide the issue. In it, the scientists note that the level of atmospheric CO2 functions as the long-wave control knob on the planet's thermostat, so that our decisions today will determine whether or not the climate system remains viable for our children and future generations.
The problem arises from that fact that, by burning coal, oil and gas, we have driven atmospheric CO2 from its preindustrial concentration of 280 parts per million to nearly 400 ppm. CO2 acts as a blanket, reducing Earth's heat radiation to space, and thus causing a planetary energy imbalance -- more energy coming in than going out. This imbalance already has driven global temperature up 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. From the measured energy imbalance today we know that more warming is "in the pipeline." It is essential to our nation's future that we act with courage and without delay to reduce the atmospheric CO2 to 350ppm or less.
In light of the short window for action -- as detailed, once again, in the recent consensus report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the Court must act to hold our government to its fundamental duty. That includes adherence to significant commitments, including our 1992 pledge to "protect the climate system for present and future generations" by stabilizing atmospheric CO2 at a level that "prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."
Yet CO2 emissions remain unabated, and our nation persists in subsidizing fossil fuels as if there were, literally, no tomorrow. We have now sped well into the danger zone, with emerging effects including more extreme heat waves, droughts and damaging fires; energized storms with heavier rains and greater floods; poleward spreading of warm-climate pests and disease vectors; growing exterminations of species; global melting of glaciers and ice sheets, with rising seas impacting every coast.
In this context our government's inaction works to consign our children and their progeny to a planet that is far less conducive to their survival -- an egregious violation of the fundamental trust obligation. The Court should decide this case and reject the notion that the federal government is exempt from the public trust. That will empower a lower federal court to require the government at least to explain how its plans could safeguard the climate system. Our political leaders must not be allowed, in violation of the public trust, blithely to ignore our children's future.

How One Man Made an Extra $1 000 Teaching What He Knewreddit
In my last post, I spoke about how the U.S. Postal Service is leveraging its existing expertise in the delivery business to begin a two-year grocery delivery test in San Francisco, CA, and how you can emulate them leveraging your existing skills by teaching what you already know.
There are a number of ways you can start this endeavor, such as by starting a YouTube Channel, a podcast or your own blog. While those are great avenues, I want to introduce you to three new ways to capitalize on your unfair advantage (teaching what you already know). This is by far the best way to earn side hustle or full-time income.
I recently interviewed Nick Loper of SideHustleNation.com. He wrote a best-selling book, Work Smarter: 350+ Online Resources Today's Top Entrepreneurs Use To Increase Productivity and Achieve Their Goals, which generated $1,400 in 30 days on Amazon. Because he kept getting asked the same question from readers on how they could replicate his success, he decided to teach a course on Udemy.com.
In his Kindle Launch Plan: $1400 in 30 Days & an Amazon Bestseller, Loper teaches you how to lay a foundation on Amazon and then how to successfully launch your book even if you don't have an audience yet.
Check out these three platforms for teaching online:
Udemy.com - Based in San Francisco, CA, Udemy offers more than 20,000 courses in every genre you can possibly think of. The best thing is, you get to set your own price, come up with your own topic and if you help to market your course, you keep 100 percent of the profit. If Udemy markets for you and brings in people, you keep 50 percent of the profits. The average instructor makes $7,000 on Udemy. Ninety-six percent of instructors make sales.
Skillshare.com - This is an online learning community. So not only can you take some amazing classes for free, you can also become a teacher on the platform and earn side income based on what you already know, love or are passionate about. Do you have expertise in design, gaming or programming? Then teach it. They have over 750,000 students, 35,000 student projects and have paid their teacher over $3 million dollars. The average teacher makes over $3,500. So what are you waiting for?
Dabble.co - If you are more of the hands-on type when it comes to teaching, then this is the platform for you. Depending on where you live, you sign up to teach classes in your own community. You can teach in a coffee shop, restaurant, you name it. Classes can be taught by anyone (which means you). You can attend a class, teach a class or host a class and let someone else do the teaching.
So now that you have the tools, it's time to start building. If you're still feeling a little hesitant, I'm sharing my insights about this very topic in an upcoming course I've titled " Teach Online: How to Create Side Hustle Income Leveraging Your Existing Skills." Let me know what you think in the comments section.

Still More Scam For-Profit College Websites -- Linked to Dallas Mystery Manreddit
I reported yesterday and this morning on scam websites that promise people help with jobs, food stamps, heat assistance, Medicaid -- things that low-income and working Americans want -- but the sites are really just fronts to get people's phone numbers, so workers at a call center in Utah can pitch them on enrolling in overpriced, low-quality for-profit colleges.
Within 90 minutes after I posted my story yesterday , one of the sites I discussed, localemploymentnetwork.org, had been shut down. Perhaps just caution by its operators, or perhaps some concern about suggestions I made that the site's owner, Neutron Interactive, and the call center's owner, EdSoup / EduTrek, might be violating federal and state laws.
This morning I discovered and wrote about other similar scam websites housed on the same server as localemploymentnetwork and Neutron's corporate site.
Now I've taken a closer look at the second bait-and-switch site I highlighted yesterday,  medicaidinsurancebenefits.com , which invites visitors to " Find and Seek Medicaid Benefits In Your Area ." Here, before proceeding, the user must provide an email address and phone number, and "agree" to a  small-print notice  "to be contacted to discuss job openings, career alerts, legal services, and educational opportunities." The contact address listed on the site is in the Philippines. Former EdSoup employees identified the site to me as another means of delivering phone numbers for deceptive for-profit college pitches.
Information found on the Internet indicates that medicaidinsurancebenefits.com was registered three months ago to one Fernando Reighard, at a residential address in Dallas.  I can find no information in any database anywhere about Fernando Reighard, other than that similar websites have been registered in his name in recent months -- such as medicaidapplicationusa.com and snapfoodstampsonline.com  -- some screen shots here and here , in case the sites get taken down. Fernando Reighard is also the name listed as registering recallsettlementsearch.com, which is targeted at people injured in GM cars or affected by recalls, and topstudentloanhelp.com, which is not currently running.
Hang on. Fernando Reighard and the Dallas house address are also connected via a website registration to an email address that in turn I found was linked to a website called familyhelpnetworkusa.com , supposedly offering housing assistance.  When I tried to get information on assistance through the website, I reached a window that asked me to agree to the following:
By clicking Get Started Instantly, I agree to be contacted to discuss job openings, career alerts, legal services, and educational opportunities at the number provided, even if a wireless number, through the use of an automated dialer by EdSoup, U.S. News University Connection, LLC or our preferred partners.
(OK, yes, I see U.S. News, and I don't know if they are really connected to this particular shady chain of actors, but I do want to investigate more down the road about U.S. News' role in lead generation. But for now...) The reference back to EdSoup confirms the interconnected nature of this web of for-profit college marketers.
According to public records, the house whose address is given in the recent website registrations for Fernando Reighard was purchased in June by Eric W. Johnson of Dallas.  No one answered the Google Voice number listed on website registrations for Fernando Reighard, and the listing I found for Eric W. Johnson led to a number whose mailbox was full.
Who is operating all these scam websites, aimed at tricking struggling people into getting on sales calls for for-profit colleges?  And when will the big for-profit colleges linked to these operations -- companies that get 85 to 90 percent of their revenues from taxpayers -- tell us the truth about how they do their business?

Behind the Handshakes  Military Tensions Are Rising Between China and Its Neighborsreddit
The president of the Philippines, Benigno Aquino, became the second of two close American allies (after Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) to shake hands with President Xi Jinping of China this week. Xi and Aquino shared promises to constructively manage tensions in the South China Sea , a promising step forward after several years of maritime incursions into territory both countries claim as their own.
Analysts say, however, the gesture, which came on the sidelines of the APEC meeting in Beijing, may not entirely calm the waters.
"Don't take Asian security for granted," Robert Kaplan, the author of "Asia's Cauldron: The South China Sea and the End of a Stable Pacific," said during a panel discussion at the Asia Society in New York on Wednesday. "There's too much tension."
There is a "naval, air, cyber, [and] high end arms race in East Asia," Kaplan said. "East Asia is as much a military climate as other parts of the world."
This does not mean there must be war, he cautioned. "More likely," he said, "what all of this means is that we are entering a more crowded, nervous, anxious world, a world more crowded with warships."
In this environment, he said, perceptions matter as much as action.
The Philippines in particular is anxious that China is out to thwart its ambitions, and control of the South China Sea could make all the difference.
"The Philippines is a poor nation," Kaplan said. "It's not like the Asian tiger economies. It's only starting its economic run. And there is a perception in the Philippines that the Chinese are going to steal their ability to become a middle class society because there's oil there."
THE REAL DISPUTE IS NOT ABOUT RESOURCES
And yet, the oil and gas that may or may not lie under the South China Sea are not the most important reason for these disagreements, the panelists said. "These disputes are not about energy at all," said Holly Morrow, a fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center. "Nobody has any idea how much oil and gas is in the disputed areas of the South China Sea."
The disagreements, she insisted, were more about politics, power and image.
Nearly all the countries involved in the dispute have indulged in symbolic posturing. In 2012, Vietnam sent six Buddhist monks to revitalize -- and serve as abbots of --abandoned temples on islands in the Spratly archipelago, which China claims. Later, Philippine troops got together with their Vietnamese counterparts to play volleyball and drink beer on another island that China claims.
None of this went unnoticed in China, of course. Vietnamese and Philippine sailors and fishermen who have the misfortune to meet a Chinese coast guard cutter at sea in a disputed area are sometimes confronted by water cannons. In May, a Vietnamese fishing boat sunk after being rammed by a Chinese vessel.
Partly, this is intended as a message to Washington through its Asian allies, the panelists said. China, they said, continues to be nervous about American power and intentions in the Pacific, and with some justification. In the Chinese media, Zha Daojiong, a professor at Peking University, said via Livestream, there is "much imagining that America is just out there to get China."
Morrow elaborated: "If China's ambitions in Asia are to assert its dominance over its neighbors, to coerce its neighbors and eject the U.S., then the U.S. aim is to thwart Chinese ambitions. There are certain Chinese objectives that the U.S. is fundamentally in disagreement with."
The establishment of a legally binding agreement between claimants, with penalties to wrongdoers, is also fraught with complications.
"Who's going to verify whom?" Zha wondered. "How do you define status quo? And should one party be determined to have violated the status quo, what next? What resolution? A military effort to evict or to blast off a manmade structure? If you say it's legally binding, then you have to design the mechanism to make it binding. How do we enforce it? Whom will enforce it?"
SHARED USE OF THE SEA
In the end, the panelists agreed, the best of all possible outcomes would be an agreement on dual-and multi-use of disputed ocean territory. It's not a matter of drawing a line, they said, with China taking one side and Vietnam and the Philippines and other claimants taking other sides.
"Each side can have an equal amount of fishery rights, can equally divide the energy finds, whatever there may be," said Kaplan. "It's about use of the sea as much as it is where one state's sovereignty begins and one state's sovereignty ends."

You re Finally Debt-Free. Now Whatreddit
When Bianca Osbourne* went away to college, she had a lot of new experiences to acclimate to: living on her own, exploring a new city... and opening up her first credit card.
As soon as she turned 18, she was inundated with card offers and started spending like crazy -- her parents had always supported her financially, and she was in the dark about managing money. It wasn't until she graduated from university that her dire financial situation (the debt reached $15,000 at its peak) hit her. "I remember waking up one morning, realizing just how much I owed, and asking myself, 'How did I get here?'" says Osbourne.
Overwhelmed and uncertain how to begin tackling the debt, she pushed it out of her mind, moved back in with her parents, and attended culinary school (funded by them). Once she finished her degree, at age 25, she finally committed to getting debt-free. She signed up for a credit-counseling program aimed at helping people in debt organize their money and pay their bills, and funneled between $140 to $250 a month into payments.
"In the beginning, paying off the debt felt exhilarating because I was confronting the situation and acting on it," she recalls. "Then it got frustrating -- I had started my own business as a chef and nutrition consultant and it started to really excel, but being in debt was limiting because I couldn't apply for loans or a credit card."
Two and a half years later, she could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Great news, right? After all, this was what she'd been waiting for and working toward. But instead of being excited, Osbourne was nervous. "I was afraid that I would end up in debt all over again," she says.
She also felt tremendous pressure to succeed in her professional life once she was debt-free. "Now I'd have nothing but myself to blame for not being able to accomplish something," she explains. "Before, if I couldn't add an aspect to my business or go on vacation, I could pin it on the fact that I was broke. Now I'd have to step it up. My grace period was reaching a close, and I thought that people were going to expect leaps and bounds from me."
It's a surprisingly common position to be in: You finally achieve the impossible (or at least what seemed impossible for a long time) and become debt-free, but instead of feeling financially empowered, you have a deer-in-the-headlights episode. You're so accustomed to being in debt that you don't quite know what to do without it.

Why We Can Miss Our Debt (at Least a Little)
However counterintuitive it may seem, sometimes there's an emotional payoff to being in debt. "You might get more compassion from people than if you were well off, and it can give you an easy out if friends or family members frequently request financial assistance," says Brad Klontz, Ph.D., co-author of "Mind Over Money" and managing partner at Occidental Asset Management.
In Osbourne's case, carrying debt allowed her to justify that she was still receiving support from her parents, and gave her an excuse not to take certain business risks (or put herself on the line for ego-damaging failure).
Emerging from a cloud of debt can also throw your social life into disarray. "You're launching into an entirely new world," says Klontz. "People tend to lose friends whenever they jump up or down financially." Klontz, who came from a blue-collar background, carried a $100,000 student loan debt after graduate school. Worried that his fancy degree might alienate him from his circle, he went out of his way to emphasize that he was broke. "I found myself bragging about how much debt I had, because I still wanted to belong to the group," he remembers.

Plus, it's overwhelming to go from having a laserlike focus on a single goal -- getting debt-free -- to actually having to make choices about what to do with your money. Andrea Trevino,* who is working her way out of $65,000 in student loans, feels paralyzed by all of the avenues that will soon be at her disposal.
"Having and managing debt takes a lot of mental and financial resources, both of which will soon be available for other goals. There will be so many things I can do with the money, it's hard to know what the smart decisions are," she explains. "I'm unprepared to be in a good place financially, and I truly do not know what steps I'm supposed to take once I'm there. What do I do with what's left after bills? Savings accounts aren't all the same, you say? Get a 401 what?"
RELATED: 401(k)s Explained: Saving for Retirement 101
So, You're Debt-Free ... Now What?
At this juncture, a budget can be more important than ever. "Having a plan for where to allocate your discretionary cash flow will help keep you from falling back into debt," says David Blaylock, a Certified Financial Planner™ with LearnVest Planning Services, who, as a rule of thumb, recommends trying to allocate roughly 20 percent of your take-home pay toward your savings goals .
OK... but what, exactly, should you do with that 20 percent? You can actually consider tackling a couple things -- like building up your emergency savings and putting money aside for retirement -- at the same time. We'll discuss how below.
Calculate what six months of your net income would amount to, and that's the sum you should consider shoring up in an emergency savings fund. That way, should anything happen (losing your job, getting in an accident, a sudden move), you'll ideally have enough to live on without having to take out loans. "The purpose here is accessibility and liquidity, not growth," says Blaylock. And try not to dip into that money, unless it truly is an emergency.
RELATED: The Three Times I Used My Emergency Fund: Was I Right to Dip Into It?
At the same time you may want to start saving for retirement, because, with this goal, time is your friend. "Start with your company's 401(k) plan," says Blaylock. Many organizations will match employees' contributions, which is like getting free money, plus you can arrange to have automated deductions from your paycheck pushed into a 401(k), simplifying the savings process.
If your workplace doesn't offer a 401(k) (small businesses may not), or you're self-employed or a stay-at-home parent, then consider opening up an IRA through a discount brokerage firm, like Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard or TD Ameritrade. Discuss with a representative there which type of IRA might be best suited for you: Roth or traditional .
"At LearnVest, we believe that investing should be simple. For retirement, typically we recommend using an all-in-one fund solution like a low-cost target date fund that is in line with your expected retirement date," says Blaylock. Then ask the firm to set up a monthly automatic draft payment, which will withdraw a predetermined amount from your checking account each month so you don't forget to save. (If you need help with this, or determining how much you need to save for retirement altogether, a planner like Blaylock can also help you.)
You should also know that the government limits how much money you can put into tax-free retirement savings annually: $17,500 for a 401(k) and $5,500 for an IRA in 2014. "Once you're maxing out your annual contributions, it's time to focus on other goals," says Blaylock. Ask yourself, what's your next big target? Are you hoping to establish a college fund for your kids? If so, one option is to set up a 529 plan through your brokerage firm. Do you have your eye on a dream item, like a vacation home? You should consider opening a separate savings account and send any excess income there.
What Not to Do After You Pay Off That Balance
Unfortunately, it can be easy to fall back into debt. Blaylock has seen it happen with his clients: "They have denied themselves so much, and now that they can afford the new furniture/car/trip/wardrobe they've always wanted, they go overboard," he explains. "It's like being on a diet: You've been depriving yourself for so long that if you see cupcakes sitting there, you want to eat the whole box."
Ethan Saunders* paid off the last of his $38,000 of student loan debt in April, and although he's still in the clear, that feeling of temptation resonates for him. "The desire to live in the moment and overspend was squelched by knowing I had to make debt payments -- it forced me to be on a budget," he says. "Once I paid everything off, I was afraid I might start spending too much again."
To prevent yourself from landing back where you started, think about doing a financial "postmortem." "It can be critically important to understand how you got into debt in the first place," says Klontz. "You should examine your underlying beliefs about money. Our unconscious financial attitudes are often passed down to us generationally, so looking at your family history can help provide incredible insight."
He advises having conversations with the people in your life who influenced you the most and asking them what they were taught about money growing up. For instance, if things were always tight when you were a kid, you might have developed an ingrained sense of not having enough -- which in turn can lead to hoarder tendencies, or, on the other end of the spectrum, a splurge-happy mindset of spend-it-while-you-got-it.
RELATED:  7 Ways Money Memories Can Affect Your Finances
Simply making the link between your money habits and their origin may even trigger a shift in behavior. "In many cases, that 'aha!' moment gives people enough perspective to start making changes," says Klontz. Another risk factor that tips some people back in the red is financial cluelessness. "After paying back loans for an extended period, you've learned how to be in debt, but you haven't learned how to save," explains Blaylock. To get a grasp on money management, you may need to start from scratch.
So begin preparing for the transition six months to a year before you're out of debt. Pretend that your debt payments are now money you can set aside, and use the guidelines above to figure out where to channel your funds. "Moving out of your financial comfort zone is like learning a new language: In order to become fluent, you need to study the culture," says Klontz. "You don't pick up a Frommer's guide when you get off the plane; you buy it before your trip. If you skip the preparation phase, you may run the risk of finding out that the most comfortable place for you to end up is back in debt."
You might also avoid the temptation to overspend by putting your credit cards on ice -- literally. "We recommend freezing them in a bowl of water," says Blaylock, "but do not close the accounts because that could potentially damage your credit history." Or you can try a debit-card-only diet: Have a separate checking and debit card for your discretionary spending, turn off your overdraft protection and feel what it's like to live off a budget. Once you've consistently budgeted for three to six months, you can consider using a tool like LearnVest to track spending, and a credit card that you pay off in full each month for rewards.
Osbourne was so worried about getting caught up in the slippery slope of credit cards that for a long time she had only a Visa debit card. "I have such a mental block toward credit cards," she says. "Finally, I decided to apply for a card that I'll only use for business purchases."

Generosity  inclusion key to Huron s successGenerosity, inclusion key to Huron's success
Heather Charles, Chicago Tribune
Workplace Habitat for Humanity International Arthur Andersen
Huron Consulting lands on Tribune's top midsize employers list
How does a consulting company where about 60 percent of the employees work at client sites across the country build an organization that embraces values such as teamwork and accountability?
At Chicago-based Huron Consulting Group, the key ingredients include generosity, individual attention and inclusion.
Huron Consulting ranked No. 30 among midsize companies in the Tribune's Top Workplaces list, as surveyed by Workplace Dynamics, an Exton, Pa.-based consultancy.
Chicago Tribune Graphics
The consulting industry is hard on people. Consultants have to deliver timely results to demanding clients. The travel also is challenging. At Huron, consultants are usually on the road every week.
When Cara Grib, a 34-year-old director at Huron, had her first child four years ago, she didn't want be away from her baby four days a week.
"I wasn't quite ready to come back full time," she said. "It was hard to let go."
Grib worked out a part-time schedule and drove to the Wisconsin-based client's office Tuesday nights with her baby, left her baby with a nanny Wednesdays and drove home Thursdays.
"Huron helped set expectations with my client on my availability so I didn't have to have that discussion on my own," Grib said. "Having the flexibility and willingness to listen to innovative solutions when it comes to work-life balance, that's what retains people."
The grueling travel schedule is one of the big reasons people leave the consulting industry. Huron gives a $750 Visa gift card to employees on the road more than 25 nights a quarter. It also lets travelers who fly home Thursday nights work from home Fridays and provides them online access to doctors while on the road.
The company also strives to be a part of the community in Chicago as well in cities where clients are located. It's an idea Huron borrowed from a consulting firm it acquired in 2008 that had a relationship with Habitat for Humanity. Huron has continued that relationship, which allows employees in different cities to work on Habitat for Humanity projects.
"People want a sense of belonging and identity no matter where they are," said C. Mark Hussey, Huron's chief operating officer.

Why Burger King  Wendy s are Queuing Up to Set Shop in IndiaBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Big names in the fast food industry are queuing up to grab a pie of the quick service restaurant (QSR) market in India. Burger King, the world's second largest hamburger chain, opened its first outlet in Delhi on Sunday, while Ohio-based Wendy's is likely to set up shop in the first half of next year.
Foreign brands are eying the Indian market despite the presence of well entrenched players such as McDonald's, Domino's and Haldiram's. The fact that margins of existing players are under stress amid a prolonged economic slowdown also seems to have little impact on new entrants' decision to set up shop in the country.
In the September quarter, Westlife Development, a company whose subsidiary Hardcastle Restaurants is a master franchisee of McDonald's in India, reported a 600 per cent year-on-year drop in operating margins. Jubilant FoodWorks, which operates the Domino's Pizza and Dunkin' Donuts brands in India and whose shares are well tracked, reported a 280 points drop in year-on-year margins in the September quarter. Its same-store sales growth (SSSG) also declined 5.3 per cent during the quarter.
Most companies see tough days ahead despite signs of early recovery. Jubilant FoodWorks' management said it is not seeing any positive change in consumer buying patterns and expects the weakness in consumer demand to continue in the near term.
"The management guided for negative SSSG to continue for another two quarters and for SSSG to hit high-single digits only over a 4- to 8-quarter period. This is despite the second half of FY14 having negative SSSG in the base," Nomura says.
Consumers have held back spending amid the economic slowdown in India. Low spending has weighed on demand forcing companies to come up with promotional offers despite a sharp jump in input prices. High attrition and real estate rental costs have also impacted profitability, analysts say.
Current market environment has impacted shares of listed companies. Jubilant FoodWorks shares are up just 13.50 per cent, while Westlife Development shares are down 17 per cent over the last one year. In contrast, the Sensex has gained over 38 per cent during the same period.
New entrants, however, believe that a recovery in around the corner. Raj Varman, chief executive of Burger King India, told NDTV that the food business is a recession-proof business. Mr Varman's Burger King is coming up with 12 restaurants in Mumbai and Delhi over the next few weeks. ( Watch the full interview )
The biggest draw for these new players is the massive growth prospects in India, analysts say. According to a report by Technopak, the QSR segment in India is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25 per cent to reach revenues of $3.2 billion by 2018 from $1.06 billion in 2013.
There's also a growing belief that demand will come back quicker-than-expected as inflation cools and disposable incomes rise. "The Indian market is on the verge of substantial recovery... Growing disposable income and rising number of dual income families mean the headroom is enormous," Mr Varman added.
A sharp fall in inflation will also bring down input costs and increase profitability. Analysts also say that most big foreign brands have deep pockets and they can afford to play the waiting game.

Gold Price Falls by Rs 225 on Sluggish Demand, Global Cues
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 14, 2014 15:12 (IST)
Oil Ministry May Dip Into Reliance Industries Incremental Gas Price Hike Revenue Account
New Delhi: Gold prices plunged by Rs 225 to Rs 26,135 per 10 grams in the national capital on Friday on easing demand from jewellers and retailers amid a weakening global trend.
Silver also dropped by Rs 800 to Rs 34,600 per kg on poor offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said sentiment remained weak due to a fall in demand from jewellers and retailers amidst gold retreating in global markets.
Besides, crude oil prices falling to a four-year low and gain in dollar eroded demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.
Gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell 1.1 per cent to $1,149.87 an ounce and silver 2.4 per cent to $15.28 an ounce - the lowest since November 7.
Investors shifting funds towards rising equity market also dampened sentiments, traders said.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity tumbled by Rs 225 each to Rs 26,135 and Rs 25,935 per 10 grams, respectively. It had lost Rs 90 in Thursday's trade.
Sovereign too traded lower by Rs 100 to Rs 23,600 per piece of 8 grams.
Silver ready dropped by Rs 800 to Rs 34,600 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 766 to Rs 33,999 per kg.
Silver coins plummeted by Rs 1,000 to Rs 57,000 for buying and Rs 58,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Oil Falls to 4-year LowBrent Falls Below $69 as Price Rout Rolls On
New York: Oil prices slumped more than 3 per cent to four-year lows on Thursday, with benchmark Brent crashing below $80 a barrel, after a stockpile surge at the delivery point for US crude frayed nerves of traders already worried about an oil glut.
The decline compounded Wednesday's losses stemming from comments by Saudi Arabia's oil minister that showed little will by the kingdom to cut output when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27.
Brent settled down $2.46, or 3.1 per cent, at $77.92 a barrel, after plumbing a September 2010 low of $77.83.
US crude finished down $2.97, or 3.9 per cent, at $74.21. In post-settlement trade, it went as low as $74.07, also a trough from September 2010.
Futures of US gasoline blendstock RBOB and heating oil fell to four-year lows too, with gasoline breaching the $2-per-gallon mark.
Crude prices, which have slumped some 30 per cent since June on fears of an oversupplied market, plunged below support levels of $80 a barrel for Brent and $75 for US crude.
Some market analysts think US crude is on course to break below $70 a barrel.
"Certainly, $70 seems to be the next major target to take out," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Texas. "There is little in the way of market bears clawing toward that."
The losses came after the US government's Energy Information Administration said stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for US crude futures rose 1.7 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 7. Gasoline stocks surged 1.8 million barrels.
Some thought the selloff was overdone as the market appeared to have overlooked an overall drop of 1.7 million barrels in crude inventories. There was also a 2.8 million-barrel draw in distillate stocks, which included heating oil, and a spike in refinery utilization.
"To me, the market's reaction confirms just how bearish sentiment is. Even with decent numbers like these, the market can't rally," said Kyle Cooper, managing director at energy consultancy IAF Advisors in Houston.
OPEC members meet in Vienna on Nov. 27, when they will consider how to respond to the price slump over the past five months. Some have said they want a cut in output.
Qatar expects to lower oil output to about 500,000 bpd by the end of November from 650,000 bpd at the end of October and from 800,000 a month before that, an industry source familiar with the matter said.
But top oil exporter and OPEC's most powerful member, Saudi Arabia, has refrained from backing a cut, prompting speculation that it is more concerned with keeping market share than supporting prices.
"We do not set the oil price. The market sets the prices," Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Wednesday.

Delhi is denser and safer than New York  says LSE reportFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
New Delhi has high average density of built up area, nearly twice the levels of wider New York metro area despite the Indian capital’s relatively low-rise urban landscape, a research report prepared by London School of Economics has said.
“Comparing Delhi’s urban dynamics to the eight other Urban Age cities – London, Bogota, Lagos, Tokyo, New York, Istanbul and Berlin- highlights that despite the capital’s relatively low-rise urban landscape, it has an extremely high average density of built up area of 19,698 people per square kilometre.
“This is nearly twice the levels for wider New York metro area (which at 11,531 people/sq km includes high-rise Manhattan), the research report which was released today said.
The report also said Delhi scores well in having a very low level of violent crime measured by the murder rate (homicides per 100,000 people), than New York and Istanbul.
The research has been carried out in preparation of the two-day conference on Urban Age ‘Governing Urban Futures’ which started here today.
The conference is being organised by ‘LSE Cities’ at the London School of Economics and Political Science and Deutsche Bank’s Alfred Herrhausen Society in partnership with the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).
Speaking on the occasion, Deutsche Bank AG Co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain said,”Today, cities account for 2 per cent of the world’s landmass but produce 80 per of global wealth. Over the next 30 years, one third of the world’s economic growth will be generated in the top 100 cities.”
Quoting the McKinsey Global Institute report, Jain said, “India needs to build the equivalent of a new Chicago every year for the next few decades to sustain its growth.”
“That’s why the Indian government’s ‘100 Smart Cities’ initiative is so important,” he added.

Kunal Ghosh stable after suicide bid in jail; Mamata suspends staffComments
Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh, an accused in the multi-crore Saradha scam, took 26 sleeping pills in an alleged suicide bid inside the Kolkata jail where he has been locked up for the past year.
Kunal Ghosh, the CEO of the erstwhile media houses run by Saradha Group, had threatened suicide in front of a judge on Monday unless the influential people named in the scam were not arrested within 72 hours. (PTI Photo)
Ghosh, who was the CEO of Saradha’s media wing at the time the Ponzi scheme at the company unravelled, was rushed to hospital where doctors said his condition was stable.
The one-time close confidant of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had threatened this week to end his life if the CBI failed to take action against others involved in the scam.
Jail authorities filed an FIR against Ghosh as attempted suicide is a criminal offence.
"According to a complaint lodged by jail authorities, a case has been registered against Kunal Ghosh u/s section 309 of IPC," said Rajeev Mishra, joint commissioner (headquarters) of Kolkata Police.
A hospital official said Ghosh told doctors in the emergency department that he had consumed 26 pills.
“A six-member medical board has been formed to treat him. He is stable now. The team will decide when to discharge him,” said Pradip Mitra, director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research. “The contents of his stomach have been sent for forensic test.”
Prison officials failed to explain how the suspended Trinamool Congress leader managed to procure the sedatives despite being lodged in a high-security cell at the Presidency jail with two guards keeping watch.
“He was extremely depressed even during the last hearing (on Monday). We informed the court too. It is surprising how sedatives find their way inside the jail,” said Ghosh's lawyer, Soumyajit Raha.
Three letters were found in Ghosh's jail cell, sources said. One was addressed to the Chief Justice of India, another to the chief justice of the Calcutta High Court and the third to Saradha investors.
The chief minister suspended the jail superintendent as well as the doctor and nurse on duty while the state government set up a committee to probe the incident.
The incident triggered a torrent of questions from opposition leaders who said there could be a conspiracy to eliminate Ghosh by the real architects of the scam.
“If Kunal dies who will benefit? They will be senior Trinamool Congress leaders against whom he has been spilling the beans for a long time. People will take this incident as a conspiracy,” said senior state Congress leader Abdul Mannan.
The Saradha scam has turned into a major embarrassment for Trinamool chief Banerjee who has been accused by opposition parties of trying to shield some of the beneficiaries of the company’s slush funds.
The scam was caused by the collapse of an investment operation from the Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private firms that was running many unlicensed financial schemes in eastern India.
The group folded up in April last year, resulting in the loss of hundreds of crores to thousands of investors — largely from rural areas with little access to banking facilities.
During a court hearing in September, Ghosh said he was being unjustly kept behind bars while bigger beneficiaries of the scam were inaugurating community Durga Puja ceremonies.
Early on Friday, a guard deployed outside Ghosh’s cell saw the MP unconscious and informed jail officials. The local police were called and Ghosh was taken to hospital.

The Government Property Clause and ZivotofskyBy Eugene Kontorovich November 14
Jack Goldsmith, Martin Lederman and several others have suggested that the Supreme Court could avoid difficult constitutional decisions about the separation of powers in foreign relations in Zivotofsky v. Clinton by finding the Jerusalem passport law exceeds Congress’s enumerated powers .
I think the Art. I arguments are strong, but moreover I can’t see striking a statute down for exceeding enumerated powers (and without any federalism element) as a narrower or easier way to decide the case than dealing with the separation of powers issues. Moreover, all the constitutional questions can be easily avoided: as the petitioners have argued, supported by numerous amici, the case does not involve a conflict about recognition , and thus does not require any constitutional ruling.
However, the always insightful Seth Barrett Tillman has identified what may be the clearest enumerated power: the Property Clause (Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2): “The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States…”). While primarily designed for government lands, its text and application extends to movable property.
The passport is government property, as its contents themselves declare. (I had previously noted this to suggest a problem with standing on the plaintiff’s part, but even baillees can have sufficient common law interests in a thing to create standing even under the most restrictive notions.) Congress’s powers under the Property Clause are extensive, and not limited to implementing the direct purpose or function of the piece of property. (For example, the Northwest Ordinance did more than just provide a minimum government for the territory, but included a variety of unrelated and discretionary policy measures.) Gary Lawson has argued that the scope of “needful rules” gives even broader discretion than the capacious “necessary and proper.”
The fact that the president claims this particular piece of government property as an instrument of foreign relations hardly matters. Surely Congress can regulate the architecture and other features of embassies under the same power.

Google Glass may not become a consumer hitGoogle Glass future clouded as some early believers lose faith

While Glass may find some specialized, even lucrative, uses in the workplace, its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim, many developers say.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SAN FRANCISCO: After two years of popping up at high-profile events sporting Google Glass, the gadget that transforms eyeglasses into spy-movie worthy technology, Google co-founder Sergey Brin sauntered bare-faced into a Silicon Valley red-carpet event on Sunday.
He'd left his pair in the car, Brin told a reporter. The Googler, who heads up the top-secret lab which developed Glass, has hardly given up on the product -- he recently wore his pair to the beach.
But Brin's timing is not propitious, coming as many developers and early Glass users are losing interest in the much-hyped, $1,500 test version of the product: a camera, processor and stamp-sized computer screen mounted to the edge of eyeglass frames. Google Inc itself has pushed back the Glass roll out to the mass market.
While Glass may find some specialized, even lucrative, uses in the workplace, its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim, many developers say.
Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device. Three more have switched to developing for business, leaving behind consumer projects.
Plenty of larger developers remain with Glass. The nearly 100 apps on the official web site include Facebook and OpenTable, although one major player recently defected: Twitter.
"If there was 200 million Google Glasses sold, it would be a different perspective. There's no market at this point," said Tom Frencel, the Chief Executive of Little Guy Games, which put development of a Glass game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms, including the Facebook Inc-owned virtual-reality goggles Oculus Rift.
Several key Google employees instrumental to developing Glass have left the company in the last six months, including lead developer Babak Parviz, electrical engineering chief Adrian Wong, and Ossama Alami, director of developer relations.
And a Glass funding consortium created by Google Ventures and two of Silicon Valley's biggest venture capitalists, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Andreessen Horowitz, quietly deleted its website, routing users to the main Glass site.
Google insists it is committed to Glass, with hundreds of engineers and executives working on it, as well as new fashionista boss Ivy Ross, a former Calvin Klein executive. Tens of thousands use Glass in the pilot consumer program.
"We are completely energized and as energized as ever about the opportunity that wearables and Glass in particular represent," said Glass Head of Business Operations Chris O'Neill.
Glass was the first project to emerge from Google's X division, the secretive group tasked with developing "moonshot" products such as self-driving cars. Glass and wearable devices overall amount to a new technology, as smartphones once were, that will likely take time to evolve into a product that clicks with consumers.
"We are as committed as ever to a consumer launch. That is going to take time and we are not going to launch this product until it's absolutely ready," O'Neill said.
Brin had predicted a launch this year, but 2015 is now the most likely date, a person familiar with the matter said.

NEW DELHI: India's largest realty company DLF today said it plans to launch the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) next fiscal to monetise its commercial assets and is in talks with global players for partnership.
In an analyst presentation, DLF said it is targeting to "create one or more sizeable REIT platform next year -- one for office and the other for retail-- to recycle capital for further growth and spin off the RentCo (its rental business arm) attributable debt",
The company has strong a portfolio of office and retail properties from which it at present earns about Rs 2,100 crore annually as rental income.
DLF seeks to create long-term free cash flows in the form of dividend flows as holders of REIT units and fees from the management of the trust.
Later in the conference call with analysts, DLF said that it did not want to "speculate" whether its REITs plan would be affected by the market regulator SEBI order barring company and six others for accessing the capital markets for 3 years.
DLF, however, said that REITs would be launched at a subsidiary level.
"We are in a dialogue with number of global players for strategic and financial partnership for REITs," DLF Executive Director (Finance) Saurabh Chawla told analysts.
Stating that the REIT platforms is likely to launched in early part of 2015-16 fiscal, he said REITs could be a "game changer" as the business trust would the company in unlocking value of commercial assets, besides aiding spin-off of debt and creating long-term free cash flows in dividend form.
When asked whether the SEBI order would be applicable on REITs, DLF Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Ashok Tyagi said: "We would not like to speculate on that".
Chawla said REITs would anyway "happen in the subsidiary", but he expected clarity from Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on SEBI order by the time company come up with REITs.
The objective of launching REIT would be to maximise the assets' present value and capture the immense potential of growth that a growing Indian economy has to offer, DLF said.
In September, market regulator Sebi had notified norms for listing of business trust structures, REITs and InvITs ( Infrastructure Investment Trust), that would help attract more funds in a transparent manner into realty and infrastructure sectors. These trusts would get tax incentives.
As growth cycle in office and retail segments of RentCo business improves, DLF said, it is reviewing all options so that the company not only maintains its leadership position but also harnesses the growth that the market shall offer.
"To achieve the above, the company is exploring partnership with other global players, both strategic and financial partners, who may have an interest in participating with DLF in this foray. This could include encashing company's part investment in RentCo business," the presentation said.
  Tyagi clarified that another proceeding by Sebi against the company is not a new case but is related to the same case where the regulator had passed the order barring DLF from accessing the capital market.
"This is not a new case. It is the same case," he said. Yesterday, DLF said SEBI had "issued a (SCN) show-cause notice dated August 28, 2013 under Sections 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 and under Rule 4 of the SEBI (procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995, hearing on which has been completed and the company has filed its written synopsis/submissions"
"The order from SEBI on the said notice is awaited," it had added.
Asked about the conversion of Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) held by its promoters as the deadline for same is March 2015, DLF CFO Tyagi said: "There is still 4 months time. Let's see"
Chawla said that these CCPS can be converted into equity. Post conversion of CCPS into equity shares, DLF promoters will have 40 per cent economic interest in DLF's commercial arm DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd.
In late 2009, DLF had announced merger of its subsidiary DLF Cyber City Developers with promoters firm Caraf Builders & Constructions, the holding company of DLF Assets Pvt Ltd.
It had also said that post merger, DLF would have 60 per cent stake in DLF Cyber City and the residual 40 per cent economic interest would be held by the shareholders of Caraf.
DLF Cyber City Developers had then issued CCPS worth Rs 1,597 crore to the promoters.
Meanwhile, DLF expects to achieve sales booking guidance of Rs 3,500-4,000 crore for this fiscal on the back of three new launches of projects in Delhi and Gurgaon markets.
However, the company said it would be difficult to meet targets in volume terms.
Tyagi also told analysts that the company would continue with strategy to divest non-core land parcels in Hyderabad, Goa and also few in north India. It would also look to raise funds through private equity at project level.

(Tata Motors Ltd, India's…)
MUMBAI: India's largest automobile company by revenues, Tata Motors posted a 7% decline in consolidated net profit for the second quarter ended September, missing the street estimates by a large margin.
Arecord high loss by its domestic operation coupled with revaluation of currency (£85 million), higher tax provision and increased depreciation cost at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) took a toll on the consolidated profits for the second quarter of FY15. The consolidated net profit for Q2 stood at Rs3,291 crore against Rs3,542 crore posted in the same period last year. The consolidated net revenues for the period grew 6.5% and the EBIDTA margin too expanded by 70 basis po ints to 17% in the quarter.
Reviewing the Q2 earnings C Ramakrishnan, CFO, Tata Motors said, as far as JLR is concerned, a higher tax provisioning and more importantly, JLR had a lot of new projects getting launched and the company is continuing to invest in lot of new products, so the depreciation and amortisation charge is also growing. "It is, however, a non-cash expenditure. Apart from this, there was a marginal revaluation of currency. Its domestic business had a certain amount of reversals of tax credits," said Ramakrishnan.
While JLR reported a healthy margin expansion of 190 basis points to a whopping 19.4% EBIDTA margins, a single digit growth in volumes, meant revenues were only marginally up 4.2% to £4,808 million (Rs46,455 crore) and PAT fell 11.24% to £450 million (Rs4,347.9 crore).
On the JLR front, the new models XE and Discovery Sport will help build the sales momentum in 2015 and the Chinese JV will start commercial production, which will help meet the demand in China more aggressively. The region makes up for over a quarter of sales for JLR.
Closer home the signs of a pick up in sentiment, has resulted in growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment, but the company says the real growth is only expected next year. And on the passenger vehicle front, a large part of its portfolio is struggling, with only saving grace being, the newly launched Zest, which the company claimed had a good response from the market with over 10,000 units sold so far. However, this had little impact on the standalone earnings.
On a standalone basis, the condition has turned from bad to worse. The standalone loss has more than doubled toRs1,846 crore, which is the highest ever loss in the company's history with a negative EBIDTA of Rs145 crore and a EBIDTA margin of which was a negative 1.7%.

(Haley said focusing on India…)
CHANDIGARH: Seeking to connect her "two homes", Indian-American Governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley today pitched for two-way investment flows between Punjab and her state in the US.
"It is a very emotional trip. I have not been here (Punjab) since I was two. So I am proud of now that I have some memories. Before (this visit) I had dreams, I had imaginations. I had what I had thought what India was. It is much more and much better. Hospitality has been fantastic...," Haley, who is heading an 18-member delegation to India, told reporters here today.
"For me to (be) here and see the place my parents talk about. They still talk about it and they get emotional. When I go home and I can have conversation with them and we do not expect it would be our last visit," the 42-year old said who earlier had an interactive session with local industrialists.
Haley is on a 10-day trip to India and will be visiting Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai.
She will also be going to Amritsar today evening. Describing her visit to India as an "important" trip, Haley said focusing on India for attracting investments was "personal," saying it is like "connecting my two homes together."
"We do focus on other countries. But the difference with India is personal. I want connection with India and South Carolina," she further said.
"It is personal for me to be able to come back to India. To being here in Punjab is a fact that if I am going to bring international companies, I want Indian companies. That is what want I do. It is home to home, connecting my two homes together," she said assuring Indian industrialists that their businesses would be "well taken care of" in South Carolina and would also give her reason to come back to India.
Describing India as a "potential market" and "potential partner", the South Carolina Governor said she was looking at business opportunities with India in the field of Pharmaceuticals , automotive , Information Technology and other sectors.

Modi may raise black money issue at G20 meetModi may raise black money issue at G20 meet
PTI  Brisbane, November 14, 2014
First Published: 12:40 IST(14/11/2014) | Last Updated: 17:28 IST(14/11/2014)
As India's attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad continues, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will push for stepping up global cooperation against the key issue of cross border tax avoidance and evasion at the G20 summit starting on Saturday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives at the Brisbane G20 Terminal in Australia. (Reuters Photo)
Modi, who is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, arrived in Brisbane on a five-day trip to Australia on the second leg of his 10-day three-nation tour.
He will also undertake a bilateral visit to the Australian capital Canberra for talks with Premier Tony Abbott on Tuesday.
The Prime Minister will also utilise the two-day 9th G20 summit of the world's biggest developed and emerging economies, to flag India's concerns over "jobless growth" prospects.
Ahead of the summit, Modi felt that focusing on transforming the quality of life of people and not just on issues like the health of the financial markets was necessary for creating employment-generating economic growth.
It was a bright and sunny day at Brisbane as Modi stepped out of his Special Air India plane at the international airport after an overnight flight from Myanmar capital Nay Phi Taw where he attended two back-to-back international summits and had a string of bilateral meetings.
"Reached Brisbane. It is bright and sunny outside," Modi tweeted.
Modi was received at the airport by the Queensland Premier Campbell Newman among others. Indian High Commissioner in Australia Biren Nanda was also present.
"A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money," Modi had said, as he is set to renew the country's commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
Modi had also said he intends to discuss how G20 can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure and ensure access to clean and affordable energy.
The G20 includes 19 individual countries -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the US -- and the European Union (EU).
Collectively, the G20 economies account for around 85% of the GDP, 80% of world trade and two-thirds of the world population. The G20 was launched in 2008 in the US.
Jobs and growth will remain the focus of the G20 summit, despite strenuous lobbying to shift the spotlight to climate change and Ebola.
Australia, which holds the G20 presidency, on Friday re-emphasised the summit's mission when Treasurer Joe Hockey stressed the heavy burden on group members "to get real outcomes".
"We have a plan before the leaders of the world to grow the world economy, to create the jobs that are necessary, to lift people out of poverty, and we are determined to deliver that," he said.
On the table is Australia's call for the G20 to collectively add at least two per cent to world growth to 2018. If successful, this could generate millions of jobs, massive infrastructure activity and cut red tape.
G20 countries have also produced 1,000 plans to support the growth target.
Modi, referring to his four-city Australia visit that covers Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney besides Canberra, had earlier said, "While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential."
"A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India's economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood," he said.
Indian officials said that the prime minister's trip will be a "landmark visit" and is aimed at "re-engaging" Australia.
Prime Minister Abbott had a telephonic talk with Modi before his departure from India to discuss the agenda for the multilateral meeting and he asked the Indian leader to share, in particular, his vision for accelerating global economic growth and employment generation.
Abbott conveyed that he and the Australian people were keenly awaiting the visit of Modi, who appreciated his personal attention to his visit and emphasised the importance he attached to his Australia visit as a step towards qualitatively transforming a relationship that he greatly values.
Abbott also sought Modi's support for Australia's infrastructure initiatives in the G20.
On his part, Modi thanked Abbott for his leadership in developing a meaningful agenda for the G20 Summit and expressed confidence that it would be one of the most memorable G20 Summits, which will impart new momentum to the global economy.
Modi also suggested that, in addition to facilitating financial flows for infrastructure financing, there was a need to look at innovative mechanisms for infrastructure development, including research on transforming waste into infrastructure inputs.
During the telephonic conversation, Modi also talked about creating a virtual centre for information exchange, guidance, identifying opportunities and facilitating flows, which would be beneficial to the poor countries as well.
Modi and Abbott had summit talks in Delhi last month during which India and Australia sealed a civil nuclear deal.
On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Modi is due to hold a series of bilateral meetings including with Germany's Angela Merkel, UK's David Cameron and France's Francois Hollande.
Modi will also have an informal interaction with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting of leaders of five-nation BRICS.
Modi has already met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday in Nay Phi Taw. Modi is also due to address a joint sitting of Federal Parliament in Canberra and the Indian community at a reception at the Olympic park in Sydney.
Modi will travel to Fiji on a day-long visit on November 19 before returning home the next day. He will be the first Indian Premier to visit the south Pacific Island nation after a gap of 33 years, the first being Indira Gandhi in 1981.

After Yoga got a strong leg up on the world stage following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for observing an International Yoga Day, the European Union (EU) has backed the initiative.
“EU supports your initiative for a Yoga Day,” the European Council President Herman von Rompuy told Mr. Modi during their meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit.
Mr. Modi in his maiden address to the UN General Assembly in September had made a passionate plea for observing an International Yoga Day, describing the ancient science as “India’s gift to the world”.
About 130 countries, including the U.S., Canada and China, have signed up for co-sponsorship of a draft resolution, which India’s UN mission is preparing for declaring June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.
The resolution is expected to be submitted soon to the UN secretariat with the government looking to aggressively push for its adoption before the end of 2014.

Dot-com peak near: Thank these Nasdaq stocks8 Nasdaq stocks lead way to dot-com top

USA TODAY
Nasdaq investors are counting the ticks until they can join the new high party other major indexes are celebrating. The day is getting near thanks to a number of stocks pulling the weight.
The Nasdaq itself might still be more than 7% below its 2000 high, but the index is still at its highest level since March, 28, 2000. Why? So far, 727 of the 1,233 Nasdaq composite stocks that were trading in the index back then — and still trade today — are actually already higher, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Here’s the part that will surprise you even more: Most of the biggest winners aren’t tech stocks.
Driving the Nasdaq higher aren’t the familiar names of the tech boom — but instead a cadre of almost everything but. Just eight stocks in the Nasdaq 100, including energy drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) , single-cup coffee company Keurig Green Mountain (GRMR) and agricultural retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) are up 2,000% or more from where they were on March 10, 2000 — when the Nasdaq peaked.
These stocks are especially meaningful since they’re the leaders of the current Nasdaq 100, which are the 100 most valuable non-financial stocks in the Nasdaq. They’re also the stocks that largely drive the index’ value.
The contribution of these winning stocks is essential to pull the Nasdaq back to the level some investors thought they’d never seen again in their lifetime. The Nasdaq itself is still 7.3% below its all-time high of 5,048.62 set when the dot-com bubble was in full swing in March 2000. It’s been 14 years to get back. But it gets closer just about every week. The Nasdaq Friday is trading at around 4,670.
Making money from this magnificent comeback took a good dose of contrarian though. Remember that everything high-tech was the rage back in 2000. But investors who went low-tech – and invested in winning beverage makers – are the kings of the Nasdaq now.
Monster Beverage has been the biggest winner in the Nasdaq since the last time it peaked, perhaps metaphorically appropriate as it’s given the market a much needed boost when it was low on energy. Back in 2000, Monster had a much tamer name, Hansen’s Natural, and specialized in making natural juices. Shares of the company were trading for about 27 cents back then on a split-adjusted basis, says S&P Capital IQ. But when the energy drink craze landed, Monster turned into a monster. Shares have exploded 40,618% to $108.16.
Interestingly, another beverage company was the second top winner. Keurig Green Mountain was just a sleepy maker of coffee back in 2000. It was called Green Mountain Coffee Roasters with shares trading for about 40 cents back in March 2000. But everything changed after the company bought single-cup coffee brewer Keurig in 2006. Before long, revenue was soaring and the company had a partnership with Starbucks (SBUX) and Coca-Cola (KO) was an investor. Investors who bought in in 2000? They’re up 38,556%.
To be fair, there is one critical tech stock that’s helped power the Nasdaq higher, big time: Apple. Back in 2000, the company was little more than a has-been maker of PCs. But the maker of electronic gadgets first found success selling an MP3 player — but then the iPhone happened and now Apple is the most valuable U.S. company. The stock is up 2,412% since March 2000.
But if there’s a lesson in all this, it’s that serious money is to be made any time – even when the market is topping. The key is investing in growth companies that others are overlooking.

It appears the rumors are true. Islamic State is set to become the only 'state' to back its currency with gold (silver and copper) as it unveils the new coins that will be used in an attempt to solidify its makeshift caliphate. ISIS says the new currency will take the group  out of "the oppressors' money system."
 
 
As Zaid Benjamin notes, ISIS releases details of its new currancy with golden 1 & 5 dinar, silver 1, 5, 10 dirham and copper 10 & 20 fils

It seems Alan Greenspan may have been on to something after all...
"Remember
what we're looking at. Gold is a currency. It is still, by all
evidence, a premier currency. No fiat currency, including the dollar,
can match it."
*  *  *
Of course this will mean more physical demand - along with Russia and China - and so more price suppression by the West.

Or even more devious, "we must stamp out the use of gold and silver as currency in order to stamp out terrorists.  It is unfortunate that some honest people will lose the value of their gold and silver coins as a result, but we must all make sacrifices."

Cramer: Panic in oil worldcramer: panic in oil world
Bell From Legendary Doomed Arctic Expedition RecoveredFootage released by the agency last week shows the bell lying on the upper deck of the ship near where it would have been hanging when the expedition set sail in 1845.
The deck itself is difficult to see in the footage since it's covered with marine life. But the bell, made of brass, was lying on top of it, completely exposed.
The bell contains the "broad arrow," which signifies that it was property of the British government, and the date 1845. That's when the ship was outfitted for the expedition. The bell is being scanned for evidence of other marks or writing.
Post by Parks Canada .
“ The bell of HMS Erebus provides a tangible and compelling connection to the Franklin ships and is an important part of naval and Canadian history," Leona Aglukkaq, minister of the environment, was quoted as saying in a Parks Canada press release. "The recovery of this important artifact is the crowning achievement for an incredibly successful 2014 search campaign that has captivated Canadians and the entire world.”
Parks Canada said the bell is "a symbolic embodiment of the ship itself" and would be struck every half hour, day and night, to mark the passage of time and signal the changing of the crew's watches.
Post by Parks Canada .
The Erebus and its sister ship, the HMS Terror, left Britain on May 19, 1845, in search of the Northwest Passage. They were last seen in August of that year entering Baffin Bay, but became locked in the ice. The crew abandoned the ships, and all 129 were killed before they could reach safety.
Although several expeditions attempted to find the location of the lost ships, all failed until September of this year when the Erebus was discovered near King William Island .
After Parks Canada posted the first underwater footage from the wreck , taken by a camera mounted to a remotely operated vehicle, underwater archaeologists made seven dives to the ship over two days. The bell was spotted on the very first dive. While divers were not intending to bring anything back from the wreck, that changed when they found the bell.
" The objective was not to recover artifacts , but in this case here, because of the iconic symbol that a bell has … it was decided that this object should be recovered," Marc-Andre Bernier, chief of Parks Canada's underwater archeology service, told the CBC.
The bell was brought to the surface on the final dive and is undergoing conservation treatment at the Parks Canada archaeological conservation laboratory in Ottawa. The agency estimates that it'll take 18 months to complete the work.

Every Business Leader Shows Imperfections To Avoidreddit
Does it really take a few flaws to make a great entrepreneur, or are the rest of us just confused about what a perfect business person is all about? In the past I've written about the positive attributes of great entrepreneurs, so this time I thought I would focus on the negatives that I see often, and I challenge you to find someone that has all the positives and none of the negatives.
We've all heard the old adage that "nice guys finish last," so I would quickly concede that positive and negative are relative terms, depending on the context. For example, if a customer is being particularly obnoxious or demanding, would a great entrepreneur respectfully show him the door, or accommodate his demands, with the positive goal of satisfying every customer?
The business leader with the positive traits to calmly and patiently handle tough customers, vendors, and personnel situations, balancing all the issues, I would evaluate as a great one. Yet here are a few other traits that I see in great business leaders, which don't seem so positive for the entrepreneur, his team, customers, or investors:
Multitasking to the extent of thrashing. Entrepreneurs often have a thousand things going in their mind, and switch so rapidly from one to the other that they leave many people confused, including themselves. The result is that important tasks get short shrift, and relationships suffer. Don't let multitasking supersede focus and real listening.
Demands perfection from all. Entrepreneurs who are perfectionists are never satisfied with their own work, as well as the work of others. This can cause delays and costs in the business, as well as friction and frustration in relationships with team members, partners, and customers. Steve Jobs survived this imperfection, or it made Apple famous.
Strong convictions bordering on obstinate. The best leaders have strong convictions, but listen to others, and are willing to compromise when required, to move the ball forward. In business, if you refuse to compromise to meets the needs of customers, your competitors will replace you. Business is no place for stubbornness.
Not a team player. Most entrepreneurs start their business because they perceive a need in the market not seen by others, and often they just don't enjoy working with others. In time, however, every business requires a team, and giving up control becomes a constant struggle. Some entrepreneurs simply jump ship and start again.
Over-confident to the point of being egotistical. Letting your ego drive decisions is not the same as confidence based on knowledge and trust. While entrepreneurs need a healthy ego for body armor, it can quickly become the negative trait of arrogance if not tempered. Many put Ted Turner and Larry Ellison in this category.
Procrastination on certain challenges. Sometimes I see very smart entrepreneurs who struggle with tough issues, like hiring and firing people. They may ignore these, or hand them off to a capable business partner. The positive traits of learning, management disciplines, and timely decisions have to step forward consistently to grow a business.
Paranoid reaching delusional proportions. The good trait of being alert and cautious when approaching new people and new partners can easily morph into paranoia, where the entrepreneur trusts no one, and thinks all deals are a potential plot. The best entrepreneurs believe they can find win-win relationships with partners and investors.
Work-life balance and workaholic tendencies. Most entrepreneurs will admit to being a workaholic at some stage of their startup. Ultimately this dedication will be seen as a negative trait by partners, family members, and team members, and can limit your business growth. Migrate to the positive traits of delegation and organization.
Often emotional and temperamental. Passion and sensitivity to people are key traits in every good entrepreneur, but in some cases, these can seem to escalate to mood changes and emotional outbursts for no reason. At this point the leader may make less rational decisions, and loses the loyalty and trust of associates and customers.
Looks at the world through colored lenses. Successful entrepreneurs can easily lose sight of the real business world, once the perks of power and influence set in. Many say this happened to Tony Hayward, BP CEO, after the Gulf oil spill, and AIG executives before the Depression a few years ago. The time to worry is when you start seeing humility as a character flaw, rather than a positive trait.
Every successful business leader can probably relate to these not-so-positive traits, and in many cases, will attest that without one or more of them, their business would likely have failed. The question is whether that makes them good traits, which should be learned and nurtured by every young entrepreneur who is striving to be great. I think not. There has to be a better way.

Basic car care: What every new (and old) driver should know1
Check all fluids, including engine oil, power steering, brake and transmission as well as windshield washer solvent and antifreeze/coolant. Check the oil by removing the dipstick. It usually has a yellow handle. Wipe it clean then reinsert the dipstick. Pull it back out and verify that the level is between the full and add lines. Add a quart if it is below the line.
The other fluids are visible in translucent reservoirs and may have a full and low line on the outside. See that the fluid level is correct. For windshield washer, simply fill it to the top. If other fluids are low, find a knowledgeable assistant or professional auto tech to correct the level.
Learn what fluids go where. They are not interchangeable with one another.
Check the hoses and belts to make sure they are not cracked, brittle, frayed, loose or showing signs of excessive wear. Squeeze hoses to be sure they are not too soft. If in doubt, ask your auto technician to check them when you get your next oil change.
Battery
Check the battery. Make sure the connection is clean, tight and corrosion-free. Clean corrosion with a paste of baking soda and water. Rinse thoroughly. If in doubt, have a professional test the battery.
Know how to jump-start a car. Connect the red cable (or red clamp) to the positive (+) battery post on the dead car then connect the other end to the positive post of the donor battery. Next, connect the black lead to the negative (-) terminal of the donor battery then the other lead to a ground at least a foot away from the dead battery. Allow a few minutes for the dead battery to charge up then remove the cables in reverse order.
Wear eye protection. Batteries produce hydrogen gas and a spark or flame can cause an explosion. Never lean over a battery when working near it.
Noise proof
Check the exhaust system. If you hear exhaust noise have the system checked for leaks, damage and broken supports or hangers. Exhaust leaks can be dangerous; correct them right away. You may be able to slide beneath an SUV or van and spot holes, cracks or broken hardware. Otherwise, ask your mechanic to check the system when the car is on the lift.
Under pressure
Check the tires, including tire pressure and tread depth. Use a gauge to check that the tire pressure agrees with the label on the door, not the maximum pressure molded into the tires' sidewalls. Uneven wear indicates a need for wheel alignment. Check the tires for bulges and bald spots.
See if the wear bars are showing perpendicular to the treads. Evenly spaced around the tires, wear bars appear when tread depth is less than 2/32 inch. Some people suggest inserting a nickel between the treads. If Jefferson's head is fully visible, replace the tires.
Check the pressure in the spare. Discover where it is and how to take it out of stowage in the event you must change a flat. Locate the jack and any tools needed to operate the jack and remove the lug nuts from the wheel.
Practice changing a tire. Check your owner's manual for the lifting locations so you will know where to place the jack. Placing it in the wrong spot could damage the car's floor or fuel lines or brake lines.
Practice changing tires in a driveway or parking lot where you will be safe. If you must change a flat on the road, drive to a safe place. Although you may ruin the tire by driving on a flat, it is better than risking your life.
Wipers
Check the wiper blades. Worn wipers streak, making it hard to see clearly when driving during precipitation. Although not difficult to replace, they can be confusing so do not hesitate to ask for help.
Safety skills
Since your first car may be a used car, it may not have all the electronics and infotainment systems common in a new vehicle. In fact, it may seem simple and antiquated with a modicum of switches and gauges, so much so that you may be tempted to multitask. Avoid the temptation.
Your cell phone may be your most valuable bit of safety equipment, but you must use it in a safe manner. Do not talk or text while driving. Use the phone to call for roadside assistance after you are safely off the road. Then stay inside the car until help arrives.
Most new cares come with roadside assistance, at least for a period of time. Most used cars do not and most new car owners start with a used car. Consider joining AAA or other roadside assistance program. (It would make an excellent birthday present if someone needs a hint.)

What to do when you havent saved a dime for collegeBy Danielle Douglas-Gabriel November 12 Follow @DaniDougPost
Don’t have much money saved for your college-bound kid? There are options.  (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)
Your high school senior comes home with a stack of college applications. As thrilled as you are, you get a sinking feeling because you’ve saved nothing to cover the costs of her dream school. Now what?
There are options available to help you pay for your child’s education. A crucial first step is having a frank conversation with your college-bound student about your finances. Figure out how much you can contribute, but don’t immediately write off expensive schools, said Lauren Asher, president of the Institute for College Access & Success, an education nonprofit.
“Look beyond the sticker price,” she said. “It doesn’t tell you much about what you and your child will be expected to pay at a specific schools. Most people don’t pay the full sticker price because aid can help offset the costs.”
Colleges are required to post net-price calculators on their Web sites to give families an estimate of what they can expect to pay based on such factors as income, bank balances and test scores. Calculators vary from school to school, but they paint a more accurate picture of individual pricing than the standard cost of attendance found in applications.
Consider this: While the full price of tuition, fees and living expenses averaged $40,920 at private colleges in the 2013-2014 academic year, the amount students actually paid averaged $23,290 after scholarships and grants, according to the College Board. Student aid lowered the average cost of public colleges from $18,390 to $12,620.
Those five-figure averages may still seem daunting, but the calculation is a starting point. To get a truly complete picture of what your child is eligible for, you’ll have to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which colleges use to determine the amount of aid to award to students. FAFSA forms for the 2015-2016 school year come out in January, so look out for those then.
In the meantime, here’s a cheat sheet for getting a jump on what your options are:
FEDERAL & PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS: Chances are, your child will have to borrow some money to pay for college. Students can either get money directly from the federal government or private lenders — banks, credit unions and other financial firms that provide education loans.
There are a few types of federal student loans. Subsidized Stafford loans are earmarked for lower income students whose families can’t contribute much, while unsubsidized loans are open to everyone. The other big difference is the government pays the interest on subsidized loans while your child is in school, which is not the case with unsubsidized debt.
“There is no income cap for federal student loans,” Asher noted. “Subsidized Stafford loan eligibility is based on a combination of your family’s resources and the cost of the school, so in some cases, a child from a high-income family applying to a high-cost school might still qualify.”
There are caps on how much students can borrow that increase on an annual basis. In the 2013-2014 academic year, freshmen could take out no more than $5,500, sophomores $6,500 and so on. Students can borrow more if they are legally independent of their parents.
Students may also qualify for a Perkins loan, which uses federal money and payments from prior recipients to help the neediest kids. Your child has to attend a participating school to be eligible, and the pool of money available varies from one school to another.
How do you pay back these loans? Federal loans, including Stafford and Perkins, are eligible for government programs called income-driven repayment plans , which could be a big help for your child after graduation. These plans, with such names as Pay as You Earn, are designed to help people who leave school with debt that exceeds, or comes close to exceeding, what they earn in a year. Say your daughter graduates with $29,000 in student loans and lands a job earning $30,000 a year. If she has a hard time keeping up with all of her bills, she could apply to have the government limit her monthly payments to as low as 10 percent of disposable income or $104.
There’s also private borrowing options, but keep in mind that new private loans are not eligible for these helpful government repayment plans. Private loans also typically carry higher interest rates than federal loans, so they are recommended as a last resort. Lenders often require a co-signer, which means you could be saddled with your child’s debt if he fails to pay.
Financial planners say the total amount of debt your child takes out should be no more than the starting annual salary in his or her desired profession. The average starting salary for 2013 grads with a bachelor’s degree was $45,000, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Keep that in mind as you borrow from year to year.
Bottom Line: Use private loans sparingly, if at all. Federal loans have more repayment options and consumer protections, but that doesn’t give you the go-ahead to load up on debt.
FEDERAL PARENT LOANS: Through what’s known as the federal PLUS program, parents can borrow up to the full cost attendance, minus the aid the student receives. That means between you and your child, you two could cover the full cost of school. But be careful.
You shouldn’t take on more debt than you can pay back in 10 years or less, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com, a college planning Web site. He recommends that the total amount you borrow for all of your children should be less than your annual income, assuming that retirement is more than 10 years away. If retirement is only five years away, you should be borrowing half as much.
Unlike the federal loans offered to students, a credit check is required. Parent PLUS loans drew criticism last year when tighter credit requirements led to a spike in rejection rates, which disproportionately impacted historically black colleges that rely heavily on such funding. Starting next year, however, it will be easier for parents to obtain PLUS loans as the Department of Education will only check the past two, not five, years of their credit histories.
“PLUS is a tricky program because you want families to have access to education, but at the same time you want to make sure they are not being burdened by excessive debt,” said Jesse O’Connell, assistant director for federal relations at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. “It’s an important tool, but one that is best used carefully.”
Bottom Line: It’s typically easier to qualify for a PLUS loan than a private loan. You can apply to defer payments if you’re struggling to pay, but federal PLUS loans do not qualify for repayment programs pegged to income. As with any form of credit, don’t over-extend yourself, especially if you’re nearing retirement.
SCHOLARSHIPS & GRANTS: Let’s talk about free money. It’s highly unlikely that your kid will get a scholarship that covers the full cost of attendance, but you could cobble together a few awards to reduce your contribution, Kantrowitz said.
Students received an average $6,200 in scholarships, grants or tuition waivers from federal, state or private sources in 2011-2012, according to the most recent data from the government’s National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. Based on an analysis of that study, Kantrowitz estimates that one in eight students received private scholarships that academic year.
“If you’re a talented student, you can win scholarships. But don’t put all of your eggs in one basket,” he said.
Stick to free scholarship matching services offered by companies such as Fastweb, College Board or Sallie Mae. Apply to as many scholarships as possible, especially smaller ones that tend to be easier to win because they are less popular, Kantrowitz said.
There are also federal grants that your child may be eligible for based on financial need. Pell Grants, the most common federal grant program, awarded a maximum of $5,730 for the 2014-2015 academic year. Grants have not kept pace with the cost of college, although the government has incrementally upped funding.
Bottom Line: Very few kids land a scholarship to cover the entire cost of attendance, so don’t sit back and wait for that golden ticket. Have your child apply to as many scholarships as possible, even while he or she is in college.
FEDERAL WORK-STUDY: If you think your child is responsible enough to balance school and work, take advantage of the federal work-study program.
Schools receive a subsidy from the government to pay up to 50 percent of a student’s wages for part-time work on campus or at a nonprofit or public agency. These are hourly jobs that pay at least the federal minimum wage. Here’s the tricky part: the money isn’t directly applied to tuition, instead students are given the autonomy to use it as they seem fit.
Awards are based on financial need and the pool of money the school receives. According to the government, schools disbursed about $1.2 billion through work study programs in the 2012-2013 academic year. Congress hasn’t poured much money into this program, so funding has been relatively flat over that past few years.
Bottom Line: Work-study jobs tend not to pay much, but every bit counts. If your child signs up for a work-study program, make sure you two create a plan for spending the paycheck. All of the money could be spent on living expenses or a portion earmarked books, but it’s best to agree beforehand.
529 PLAN: One of the best ways to save for your child’s education is to open a 529 savings plan, financial advisors say. These accounts are akin to 401k retirement plans because contributions are invested and the earnings are not subject to federal, and in most cases state, taxes. You can usually choose among a variety of investment options, including stocks, bonds or money market funds.
States sponsor these plans for a fee, but you don’t have to select a plan where you live. Shop around for plans with low fund management fees and commissions to maximize your earnings. You can open a plan through an investment broker or directly from the plan sponsor. You generally won’t be taxed on the money you put into a 529 plan as long as it’s used for college expenses. But you will be hit with a 10 percent penalty for using the money for anything besides paying for school.
It is never too late to sign up for a 529 plan, even though financial advisers say parents should open one at birth to maximize the savings.
“You could do a big lump-sum contribution, even at the last minute,” Kantrowitz said. Individual annual contributions are capped at $14,000, but you can funnel up to $70,000 into the plan as a lump sum and elect to have the evenly spread out over five years.
Bottom Line: Having money stashed away in a tax-advantaged plan to pay for school is a great way for your child to avoid graduating with mounds of debt. But investing in a 529 plan will likely reduce your child’s eligibility to receive need-based financial aid.

By Thomas Heath, The Washington Post
MapQuest users plug-in to roadside assistance with Urgent.ly app, which lets you track the location of help.
Like Uber and taxis, Urgent.ly roadside assistance app competes with traditional help from AAA and others.
Need roadside help? Use a new app to find and track the nearest repair center.
WASHINGTON — Urgent.ly, an online mobile application that allows stranded drivers to summon car repair help, is partnering with MapQuest in a deal that aims to disrupt the $10 billion roadside assistance industry much as Uber has done to the taxi and car service business.
The alliance, announced Nov. 11, allows MapQuest users to use Urgent.ly to summon help to repair a flat tire, fix a dead battery or get the vehicle towed.
Whether you are a new, young driver or someone who has never owned a car before, learning the basics of car care makes both driving and ownership more fun. Even veteran car owners should be familiar with the basics. ( Bob Weber, Special to the Tribune )
Both companies are based in Dulles, Virginia. MapQuest is an AOL property and Urgent.ly is a start-up founded in 2013 and run by several former AOL executives.
"MapQuest is one of the premiere mapping services in the U.S., and has more than 40 million users nationwide. Integrating with MapQuest allows Urgent.ly to scale quickly by providing our innovative on-demand roadside assistance service to their millions of users across the country," said Urgent.ly chief executive Chris Spanos, who once was general manager for AOL's local business.

The service will work this way: After receiving vehicle information and a description of the problem from a MapQuest user, Urgent.ly zeroes in on the driver's location and connects the stranded motorist to a nearby service provider. Users can track the service provider's progress on a map, along with its estimated time of arrival. The MapQuest customer then pays for the service on site with a credit card.
MapQuest's 44.4 million users will now be able to tap a "roadside assistance" button on the MapQuest menu bar, connecting them to Urgent.ly without going through a separate application.
"Using Urgent.ly and its upfront, flat-rate pricing, you will have an estimate on cost and answers to where and when the assistance will arrive." - Urgent.ly chief executive Chris Spanos
Urgent.ly and its new partner said they are aiming to tap into the 200 million drivers on U.S. roads who experience 100 million roadside "events" per year. The American Automobile Association, which has 53 million members, services 29 million calls for service per year.
Urgent.ly estimated there are roughly 30 million potential roadside customers who currently search online through a mobile phone to find help, according to Spanos.
"The whole thing now is if you search on your phone, and you find Joe's Towing listed, you have no idea if he is near you, open, available, capable and how much he is going to charge," Spanos said. "Using Urgent.ly and its upfront, flat-rate pricing, you will have an estimate on cost and answers to where and when the assistance will arrive."
Prior to launching Urgent.ly, Spanos, 45, founded SeniorChecked, a network of pre-screened local businesses for seniors and their families. SeniorChecked was acquired in 2011 by NEWAsurion, a company that provides insurance and services for mobile phones and other products.
Urgent.ly received $525,000 in March from BluVentures and CIT GAP Funds, which is Virginia's technology fund. Urgent.ly has been live in Washington for several months, testing its service among several thousand users.

4-step guide to creating superfansDo they have a blog? Are they journalists?
“Influencers” Do they talk about your industry? Is their audience engaged?
• Potential clients
Check LinkedIn. Do companies and job titles suggest they may be decision makers in your audience?
• Current customers
Are you already working with any of these fans? You really should know, don’t you think? Really, you’re looking for anyone who is consistently listening. Pay attention and familiar faces will appear. See them? These are your fans. If you’re lucky, you may find a few legitimate stalkers! They’re paying attention, so it’s time to return the favor. You’re ready for step two.
2. Keep them on your radar: Circles, lists and groups
Now that you’ve found them, here’s how to not lose them again.
• Connect with them on several networks
They’re really not a superfan if communication is limited to one place. Finding people on second and third networks should become second nature. Of course, use Facebook and Twitter but also sites like LinkedIn, Quora, and Slideshare.
• Keep Twitter lists and Google+ circles
This is very important. I have a Twitter list called “radar.” Watching this list makes it easier to pay attention to fans and friends. I also have a list called “clients.” You need a way to filter out noise and dial into your dedicated audience.
• Comment and share
When you comment on their posts or share something they wrote, it shows you’re reading back. You care enough to pay attention. This makes such a difference.
3. Personally reach out to readers
Say hello! Simple, right? And when they share your content, say thank you. Start a conversation, then listen. A small audience is easy to listen to. Once you connect, ask them what topics they’d like to hear more about.
They key to online networking is to keep upgrading from one channel to the next, from the first tweet all the way up to lunch.
• Email
Srinivas gives the example of Chris Guillebeau, who personally emailed every one of his first 10,000 email subscribers. Yes, that’s a commitment, but just imagine how it would energize your audience.
Your audience is listening, but they know you’re listening, too. They know you’re accessible. Drop them a line. If they write back, stay engaged. Take the next step.
• Phone
I recently wrote a post about how the phone is actually the best web marketing tool. In it, I gave an example of how one simple call led to a flurry of connections, introductions and even a lead. Phones are powerful. Don’t hesitate to reach out and blow someone’s mind.
Just dial, apologize for being so random, ask a question, listen and offer to help. The relationship is now permanently upgraded. It’s easy, unexpected and awesome. See how it goes, then take the next step…
• Face, meet face
Call me crazy, but I believe the ultra-premium-platinum-plus connection is only possible through actually meeting someone IRL (in real life). This is how true superfans are made. Big brands could never do this. But you can. It’s easy and fun.
If they’re local, grab coffee. Or find an event to go to together. Or just make yourself accessible (people who know me know where to find me on Thursdays at 6:00). Not local? No problem. Suggest a quick Hangout on Google+ or a Skype call. Jane Boyd’s 45 Conversations is an excellent example.
Anytime I meet someone who has read something I’ve written, I always ask for feedback or ask them to suggest a new topic. I’m always open to input. And now that you’ve had the ultimate chance to listen, you’re ready for step four.
4. Create content for specific readers
• Mention fans in your posts
I almost never write a post without mentioning someone. (This post mentions four people). It creates a stronger connection, but it can also help them a bit. Mentioning and linking can help with social media and search optimization. How nice of you!
• Write something just for him/her
Here’s a trick that the big blogs can’t ever do. Write something for a specific reader!
You’re writing custom content anyway. Why not customize it specifically for one of your readers? You can even turn email conversations into an online interview or Q&A session. Now you’re collaborating with fans on content. They just jumped from “fan” to “teammates.” Even better.
“When your audience is small, you can run your blog like a VIP experience.” — Srinivas
When you follow these steps, suddenly your website becomes an online networking tool. You never know who you might meet! Just like any other networking, there should be reciprocity. If they show a little love to you and your content, return the favor.

Want to boost your brain power A new study says video games are the answer.Remember when you told your kids that spending too much time playing video games would make them lazy?
(Courtesy of Activision)
Now there's a perfect comeback: Playing video games can actually make you smarter.
Really. According to a study published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, playing fast-paced action video games can make someone a better learner.
People who play games such as "Call of Duty" are better able to multitask, perform cognitive tasks such as rotating objects in their minds, and focus and retain information than non-players, Daphne Bavelier, a research professor in brain and cognitive sciences at both the University of Rochester and the University of Geneva, told Bloomberg News . They even have better vision, she said.
How is that possible? It comes down to our brain's ability to model the future.
"Our brains keep predicting what will come next — whether when listening to a conversation, driving, or even preforming surgery," Bavelier said in a news release . “In order to sharpen its prediction skills, our brains constantly build models, or ‘templates,’ of the world. The better the template, the better the performance. And now we know playing action video game actually fosters better templates."
To measure the the effects of game playing, Bavelier's research team paid a group of college students $8 an hour to play video games for 50 hours over a nine-week span. They played two contrasting types of games, according to the study : ones with lots of action ("Call of Duty 2" and "Unreal Tournament 2004"), and ones with minimal action ("The Sims 2" and "Restaurant Empire").
Key for researchers, according to the news release, was determining how quickly action video game players were able to build and refine templates compared to people playing the slower video games. Not only were they able to build templates more quickly, according to researchers, but they were able to do it while they were engaged in another activity.
“When they began the perceptual learning task, action video gamers were indistinguishable from non-action gamers; they didn’t come to the task with a better template,” said Bavelier. “Instead, they developed better templates for the task, much, much faster showing an accelerated learning curve.”
After training ended, researchers revealed, the action video game players didn't immediately lose their new-found abilities. Tested a year later, "they still outperformed other participants, suggesting that they retained their ability to build better templates."
So how did they do it?
“The brain has not just one neuron, but networks of neurons talking to each other,” Bavelier told Bloomberg. “During the task, they were changing their connectivity on the fly to match the task at hand. They knew what was important to pay attention to and what was noise and distraction, and they could suppress distractions.”
The study was funded by the Office of Naval Research, the Swiss National Foundation, the Human Frontier Science Program and the National Eye Institute.
Bavelier's research uses video games to explore how people learn and how the brain adapts to changes in experience, according to her TED bio. Her laboratory uses a multidisciplinary approach and studies behavior, brain imaging, eye tracking and vital statistics to see how individuals learn and adapt to changes in experience, such as playing video games.
Bavelier, by the way, told Bloomberg that the findings of her video game research shouldn't be an excuse to lounge in front of a screen and avoid homework.
“This is no excuse for binging,” she said. “We know that kids who spend a lot of time on computers do less well at school. If you spend too much time on this new media, you spend less time on homework and you will do less well.”

Chicago has $700 000 ready to lend to small businessesChicago has $700,000 ready to lend to small businesses
Chicago microloans
Zbigniew Bzdak, Chicago Tribune
Mayor Rahm Emanuel calls small businesses the lifeblood of neighborhood economies and job creation.

City's microloans lets small business 'not only survive, but thrive.'
Small-business owners have access to pool of $700,000 for microloans.
Business owners talk up the value of Chicago's microloan program.
An Ethiopian restaurant, a condo property management firm and a vegan catering company in Chicago have one thing in common: Their owners are thankful they got loans to start or expand their businesses when other options failed.
The small loans came through a city program that now has $700,000 more to lend.
On Thursday at Demera Ethiopian Restaurant in Uptown, Mayor Rahm Emanuel talked about the city's Microloan Institute which over the past couple of years has issued more than $1.4 million in loans to 157 businesses via the Women's Business Development Center and Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives Microfinance Group.
By the time business owners seek out the program, they have often already hit up family and friends for loans, Emanuel said.
"It's when you've gone past family — they won't invite you to Thanksgiving. And the banks, they won't talk to you ... and you can see your dreams just within reach," Emanuel said. "The microloan program allows you to bridge to that next level."
As loan repayments are made, the money can be lent again to other small businesses — and sometimes the same ones, for additional expansions.
0
Tigist Reda, owner of Demera, said she was happy to host the kickoff Thursday to raise awareness about the program because she has been the beneficiary of such programs — four times.
At the start, traditional lenders weren't interested in granting loans to renovate a restaurant less than 2 years old, even though she had substantial equity in the restaurant partly funded by $70,000 in credit card debt.
"I know firsthand how hard it can be for small businesses to find loans, especially when you are a startup," Reda said. "We knew we had good food and a good location — that if we opened it, somehow it would work out."
She ended up getting loans for renovations and hiring, growing from five employees to 17. And she said she has plans for a second location within the next year or two.
"Right now, we are in a good place, I think. We are a successful restaurant," she said.
Sarah Gullette-Johnson, of SGJ Property Management, started her business in 2008 at a kitchen table and has expanded with a $25,000 loan, used to replace a computer server and upgrade her website. "We're better poised now to be the successful company that I always envisioned," she said.
Tsadakeeyah Emmanuel, of Majani Catering, whose first restaurant failed, used his loan to help launch his next venture, a catering business. He plans to open a bricks-and-mortar vegan restaurant in the spring.
Too often, small-business owners think they cannot get loans of $250,000 or less, the city said.
That's why the city started a "Connecting to Cash" series of events aimed at raising awareness that money is available, for microloans of less than $25,000 and medium-size loans of up to $250,000.
In 2012, Emanuel launched the Chicago Microlending Institute with $1 million to help businesses get loans up to $25,000. This year, the city invested an additional $1 million to provide loans to help support about 300 new businesses by 2016 and ensure that the program can be self-funding through 2016.
Besides the $700,000 in microloans available, representatives from the city's Capital Access Center Program will be on hand to work with small businesses seeking loans.
Emanuel said the loan program is part of a larger effort to make it easier for small businesses, which he called the lifeblood of neighborhood economies and job creation in Chicago, to thrive.
Heading into his re-election campaign, Emanuel has worked to position himself as a champion of small-business growth in Chicago — even as the city has increased costs to apply for some business permits and the mayor has put in place higher taxes on cigarettes and tougher tobacco sales rules that small-business owners complain make it tougher for them to compete with neighboring suburbs.
Emanuel has also faced resistance from business groups on his endorsement of a minimum wage increase in Chicago.
Small-business owners can visit the city's Small Business Center at cityofchicago.org/sbc or in room 800 of City Hall, 121 N. LaSalle St., to learn more about access to capital in Chicago.

Pentagon to overhaul nuclear weapons programs following reviewsBy Dan Lamothe November 13 Follow @danlamothe
After internal and external reviews, Sec. of Defense Chuck Hagel announced Friday several changes to be made to the military's nuclear programs, for which he plans to request "billions of dollars of additional funding." (AP)
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will announce on Friday a comprehensive overhaul of the Pentagon’s nuclear weapons programs, after scandals in the Air Force and Navy this year prompted scrutiny, a defense official said.
The problems prompted Hagel to call for two reviews of the nuclear weapons programs early this year, and they outline a variety of deficiencies.
“While our nuclear arsenal remains safe, secure and effective today, the reports tell us we must take action now in order to ensure that remains the case in the future,” the official, who requested anonymity, said Thursday night.
After the announcement, Hagel is expected to travel to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, where Air Force officials oversee an arsenal of nuclear bombs that can be dropped from aircraft and nuclear missiles that are kept in underground silos that were built during the Cold War, and have seen few upgrades since. The defense official did not say why Hagel selected Minot as the site of his visit.
News of the overhaul, first reported by the Associated Press Thursday night, had been anticipated for months. The AP reported that the reports call for billions in upgrades to invested in support systems to keep the weapons reliable, and for the Air Force to put a four-star general in charge of its nuclear force, known as Global Strike Command. It’s currently a three-star position.
Hagel called for the two reviews in late January , after an embarrassing scandal in the Air Force in which dozens of officers overseeing nuclear missiles at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana had been caught either cheating on a monthly launch proficiency test, or knew about others who did and did nothing to stop it.
Shortly afterward, Navy officials disclosed a similar problem, saying they were investigating about 30 senior enlisted sailors for allegedly cheating on tests required to operate nuclear reactors that power both ships and submarines. They were tipped off by a sailor who served at nuclear-training program in Charleston, S.C. Thirty-four sailors ultimately were expelled.
The Air Force has been active since their scandal broke, launching an internal investigation of where their two legs of the so-called nuclear “triad” — submarines, long-range missiles and bombers — needed work. In an unprecedented move, nine commanders in the missile force were removed from their jobs and a 10th resigned in March.
More recently, two additional commanders in the missile force were fired, the Associated Press reported earlier this month . One of them served at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming; the other was at Minot.
At the same time, Air Force Secretary Deborah James and Lt. Gen. Stephen Wilson, chief of Global Strike Command, have said they will do whatever they can to change the culture in the nuclear force.
Beginning Oct. 1, missile launch officers became eligible to receive up to $300 incentive pay per month — an attempt by senior officials to underscore the importance they see the mission having. The Air Force also i ssued new uniforms, cold-weather gear and personal protective equipment to security force troops guarding the missile silos this year after they raised concerns about them during the review.
This post has been updated to correct the amount of Air Force commanders fired recently.

Everything in this story is actually, honestly true.
Onion Inc., owner of The Onion satirical news site and the entertainment site A.V. Club , has hired a financial adviser for a possible sale, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The company, which calls itself "America's Finest News Source," is working with the investment bank GCA Savvian, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.
As real newspapers struggle, fake one boasts rising viewers, revenue ( Robert Channick, Tribune reporter )
Onion can use its brand to capitalize on money flowing into Web media from traditional outlets. Funny or Die, the comedy website co-founded by Will Ferrell, recently hired Moelis & Co. to advise on strategic options. In May, Walt Disney paid $500 million for Maker Studios, while Vice Media raised $500 million in September selling 10 percent stakes to Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks.
Steve Hannah, chief executive officer of Onion, declined to comment in an email.

Founded as a magazine by a pair of students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1988, the Onion is now online only with several websites and YouTube channels that blend written satire with humorous videos. David Schafer, a fund manager, bought the company in 2003.
The Onion moved into online publishing and video as advertisers did the same. The company stopped printing its flagship weekly magazine last year, and expanded into video production several years ago, founding a daily Web broadcast called Onion News Network and then a companion sports show.
"We didn't do anything brilliant, we saw it coming," Hannah said in an interview with Bloomberg Television last year. "Print was beginning to decline. We got ahead of the game and decided to go all digital all the time."
The Onion turned its original news shows into a TV show for IFC, and also produced "Onion SportsDome" for Comedy Central. Both shows have been canceled.
Google's YouTube offered the company an additional outlet. The Onion's channel, home to spirited movie reviews and a parody of reality TV called "Sex House," has 766,455 subscribers. Onion Inc. also operates channels for the A.V. Club and Clickhole, a subsidiary site that satirizes websites like BuzzFeed and UpWorthy.
The company relocated its editorial operations to Chicago from New York two years ago.

BHEL net profit slumps 73 per cent in Sept quarterBHEL net profit slumps 73 per cent in Sept quarter
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 14, 2014  | 15:53 IST
State-owned BHEL on Friday saw its net profit tumble nearly 73 per cent to Rs 124.84 crore in three months ended September this year as lower revenues from power and industry segments took a toll on its profitability.
Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), which is currently facing tough business conditions, had a net profit of Rs 455.95 crore in the September quarter last year.
Net sales of the power equipment maker fell to Rs 6,027.58 crore in the second quarter of current fiscal. In the year-ago period, the same stood at Rs 8,819 crore, according to a regulatory filing.
Reflecting tough business conditions, BHEL's revenues from power as well as industry segments declined in the latest quarter under review.
In the 2014 September quarter, power segment saw revenues fall to Rs 4,736.95 crore from Rs 7,576.38 crore in the year-ago period.
Besides, revenues from industry segment dropped to Rs 1,582.36 crore from Rs 1,739.18 crore in the same period a year ago.
In accordance with guidelines in the Companies Act, 2013, the carrying amount of the assets as on April 1, 2014, has been depreciated over the remaining revised useful life of the fixed assets, the filing said.
"Consequently, depreciation for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2014 is higher by Rs 17.37 crore and Rs 44.31 crore, respectively, and the profit before tax is lower to this extent," it said.
Further, around Rs 35.88 crore (net of deferred tax Rs 18.48 crore) representing the carrying amount of assets with "revised useful life as nil" has been charged to the opening reserves as on April 1, the company said.
BHEL's order book stood at Rs 1,03,700 crore at the end of quarter ended September 2014.
Shares of the company closed 0.28 per cent lower at Rs 246.20 apiece on the BSE.

Russia to G-20: We re here  so are our warships | Leaders seek bold reformsAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(In recent days, four Russian…)
BRISBANE: Vladimir Putin is underlining his presence at a major summit of world leaders in Australia by stationing warships in waters off the country's northeastern coast, prompting the Australian prime minister to angrily accuse Russia of trying to reclaim the "lost glories" of the Soviet Union .
The diplomatic drama, which has been simmering since a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over an area of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists in July, threatened to overshadow Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's goal of keeping this weekend's G-20 summit focused on economic growth.
But Abbott, who had previously said he would physically confront the Russian president over the Flight 17 disaster that killed 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents, did little to dampen tensions with his latest critique of Putin's Russia.
In recent days, four Russian warships have entered international waters off the northeast Australian coast to coincide with Putin's visit to Australia for the summit that brings together the leaders of the world's 20 biggest industrialized and developing economies. Australia, in turn, sent three warships of its own to monitor them.
The Russian embassy said today that Russia's Pacific fleet was testing its range, and could be used as security for Putin.
Abbott was not impressed. "Russia is being much more assertive now than it has been for a very long time," he said at a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron , also in Australia for the summit. "Interestingly, Russia's economy is declining even as Russia's assertiveness is increasing."
The prime minister, who met with Putin earlier this week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Beijing , aired details of his conversation with the Russian leader.
"One of the points that I tried to make to President Putin is that Russia would be so much more attractive if it was aspiring to be a superpower for peace and freedom and prosperity ... instead of trying to recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the old Soviet Union."
Abbott, an athletic 56-year-old former amateur boxer whose government is a staunch US ally, has gained a higher international profile by loudly demanding more cooperation from Russia on the Dutch-led investigation into the downing of Flight 17.
He raised eyebrows last month when he declared he intended to "shirtfront" Putin, using an Australian football term for a head-on shoulder charge to an opponent's chest.

Financial inclusion agenda: all households in Kerala  Goa get bank accountseconomy, business and finance
Giving a boost to the Centre’s financial inclusion agenda, Kerala and Goa have become first states in the country with every household having at least one bank account.
“Kerala was declared as 100 per cent saturated State (in terms of coverage of all households with at least one bank account) on November 11,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
In addition, Goa, Chandigarh, Puducherry and Lakshadweep and three districts of Gujarat -Porbandar, Mehasana, Gandhi Nagar, have also covered all households under PMJDY with at least one bank account, it said.
As on November 10, 7.24 crore accounts have been opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) of which 4.29 crore in rural and 2.95 crore are in urban areas. RuPay Cards have been issued in case of 3.97 crore accounts.
Recently, Financial Services Secretary Hasmukh Adhia reviewed the progress in implementation of PMJDY with state level banking committees’ conveners of all the states.
During the meeting, banks were asked to undertake Information and Education Campaign (IEC) to disseminate information and awareness among the masses.
Department of Financial Services is regularly emphasising the early issuance of RuPay Debit Cards, e-KYC based account opening, Aadhaar seeding, financial literacy and the progress in survey made.
The statement said, 83 per cent of the survey work has been completed and banks have been asked to complete the remaining work by November 30. As per the initial results on an average about 80 per cent of the households surveyed have now got at least one bank account.
A reward scheme has also been put in place to incentivise the bankers.
Banks have been asked to be in preparedness for modified direct benefit transfer for LPG (DBTL) Scheme proposed to be launched on November 15. The DBTL scheme will be re-launched in five districts - Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Ludhiana, Barnala and Faridkot - in the first phase of the re-launch.

Tata Motors Q2 net profit declines 7.08% to Rs 3 290.86 croreUpdated: November 14, 2014 23:06 IST
Tata Motors consolidated profit drops 7 per cent

The Indian operations of leading automobile manufacturer Tata Motors continued to weigh down the company which reported a drop of 7.1 per cent in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September 2014 at Rs 3,291 crore. Consolidated revenues rose 6.5 per cent to Rs 56,867 crore owing to a good showing by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). The operating margin was up 60 basis points at 15.8 per cent.
C. Ramakrishnan, CFO, Tata Motors said two factors impacted JLR. "Higher tax provisioning and more importantly, with the new launches, higher depreciation and amortization while in India, some tax reversals of credits impacted the profitability."
Indian operations report loss
Tata Motors’ India operations reported a loss of Rs 1,845.63 crore (loss of 803.53 crore) on total income of Rs 8,750 crore (Rs 8,868.4 crore). Operating margin was negative 1.7 per cent (2 per cent) with tax was at Rs 738.2 crore (credit of Rs 180 crore).
"There was a sharp reversal in performance over the last 10 quarters with the medium & heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) sales growing 14.1 per cent due to firm freight rates and replacement demand," Ravi Pisharody, ED, CV Business, Tata Motors told a press conference. Subdued infrastructure activity and high interest rate regime impacted the quarter performance.
"The small CV segment continues to be hit by constrained financing but will pick up next year," he said. The company expects the Bolt car to be launched in the current quarter and Safari Storm facelift to drive growth.
JLR’s strong performance
An increase in wholesale volume and richer product mix saw JLR report a net profit of 450 million pounds (507 million pounds) for the September quarter on 4.2 per cent higher revenues of 4.808 billion pounds. Kenneth Gregor, CFO, JLR said the bottomline was impacted by unfavorable revaluation of foreign current debt, unrealized hedges, higher depreciation and amortization. Wholesale sales rose 2 per cent to 103,000 units while retail sales were up 8 per cent at 110,000 units. Operating profit rose 15.3 per cent at 933 million pounds and operating margin was was 19.4 per cent (17.5 per cent).
He said the China facility is expected to commence operations in the next few months and will reach a capacity of 130,000 units by 2016. "It will initially make the Range Rover Evoque and ramp up and also make Discover Sport and Jaguar XF in 2015." He said the plan was to expand the global footprint and JLR would start production at its Brazilian facility in 2016.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange, Tata Motors fell 0.47 per cent to close trade at Rs 523.8.

Battle of Wanat survivor shares on RedditBy Dan Lamothe November 14 Follow @danlamothe
This screen grab shows an Army video recreating the Battle of Wanat. A soldier who survived it described his experience this week in a popular “Ask Me Anything” segment on the website Reddit. (YouTube screen grab)
It has been more than six years since the Battle of Wanat rocked the Army, killing nine U.S. soldiers, wounding 27 more and sparking a series of investigations into how things could have gone so wrong. The battle has been one of the most widely discussed clashes of the Afghanistan War, but every now and then a new window into what happened opens — including this week on Reddit.
One of the survivors of the fight hosted an “AMA” — short for “ask me anything” — on the popular website. He remained anonymous, but submitted numerous materials, including a Bronze Star with V citation and narrative , to prove he was indeed a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade unit that was ambushed by more than 100 insurgents before dawn on July 13, 2008, in Nuristan province.
The soldier was a specialist, and wounded in the battle, he said. He chose to do the AMA because he thought it would be cathartic. The conversation includes hundreds of comments and has lasted for more than a week.
Asked to share his scariest story, he said it felt “like the world was exploding” in Wanat. Hundreds of rocket-propelled grenades and heavy gunfire from machine guns and Kalishnikov rifles filled the sky, and it was difficult to keep track of how many fellow soldiers had been hit, he recalled.
The insurgents had attacked an observation post up on a hill above the unit’s main patrol base, in addition to the main patrol base. The survivor recalled on Reddit that he was part of the group that made it up to the smaller post, and found that everyone was dead except for then-Sgt. Ryan Pitts, who would go on to receive the Medal of Honor on July 21 for valor that day.
“The stillness scared me, it just felt wrong,” the survivor wrote on Reddit. “Then some rpgs and machine gun fire hit us all. A couple of guys were thrown over a sandbag wall and the guy with me was I mean… mortally wounded and screaming and I realized I couldn’t feel my leg and my hand didn’t work.”
The soldier was overwhelmed with fear, he recalled.
“Those seconds before I snapped out of it was just blank terror,” he wrote. “I knew I was going to die and I wasn’t ready, I was still 20. But you snap out of it, keep fighting and make sure that s— doesn’t happen you know?”
Pitts had refused to give up the observation post even after he had been wounded by a grenade, badly enough that a fellow soldier put a tourniquet on his leg. He repeatedly tossed hand grenades at oncoming insurgents and manned an M-240B machine gun until other soldiers responded.
A video recreation of the battle produced this year can be seen here:
The survivor said that he was medically retired, and has tried to get back into the Army multiple times. After he returned to where his unit was station in Vicenza, Italy, he said he got out of the hospital quickly, but did not process what happened right away.
“I partied my a– off, hobbling around the streets of Italy bleeding everywhere haha,” he wrote. “Then it starts to creep in, the drinking got darker — I started getting angry and mean. I started breaking down and pushing people away. Things just got really dark for a minute. I guess when the smoke cleared I realized something had broken, I was harder and colder than I was before. It makes you see the world differently, at least in my case it did.”
Killed in the battle were Sgt. Israel Garcia, 24; 1st Lt. Jonathan P. Brostrom, 24; Cpl. Jonathan A. Ayers, 24; Cpl. Jason M. Bogar, 24; Cpl. Jason D. Hovater, 24; Cpl. Matthew B. Phillips, 27; Cpl. Pruitt A. Rainey, 22; Cpl. Gunnar W. Zwilling, 20; and Spc. Sergio S. Abad, 21.
Pitts, who left the Army as a staff sergeant, said this week that he sustained a traumatic brain injury in the battle, discussing it at a Home Base charity event in Boston. He told The Boston Globe he still has to “ride” some of his fellow soldiers who went through the battle to get help.
“At first, I felt that I deserved to suffer and that my pain was penance for my failure to bring everyone home,” Pitts told The Globe. “But I began to think about how they would want us to carry on and the lives I would want them to lead if we had traded places. We owe it to ourselves and to our fallen to lead good lives worthy of their sacrifice.”

POSCO
(The Posco plant is likely…)
AHMEDABAD: South Korean steel giant Posco has narrowed down on Sanand (Gujarat) for setting up its steel coil unit at an investment of USD 20 million.
"Posco will initiate a steel processing unit, for that they had made a proposal to GIDC. They are most likely to set up the unit at Sanand town. They (Posco) will soon make a formal application, which will probably be finalised by next week," highly-placed sources in the Gujarat government said.
Posco's Sanand unit will be their second still unit in India after Maharashtra's Pune, added the source.
As per sources in state government, Posco's steel coil unit will come up in 30,000 square metre area and will have the capacity of around 10,000 matric tonne annually.
The Posco plant is likely to produce steel coils for the automobiles, considering the grand presence of the sector in Gujarat, said the sources.
Republic of Korea's envoy Joongyu Lee had earlier said that Posco will establish a steel coil mill in Gujarat with investment of around USD 20 million in Gujarat.
Sanand had earlier become the favourite destination for the auto-manufacturers like India's Tata Nano and other multinationals including Ford and Peugeot.
Tata became the first automobile giant which had set up their Nano car plant in Sanand town, after they faced revolt in West Bengal's Singur and had to move to Gujarat accepting the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi's invitation.
Ford has also established their production unit in the same area.
Apart from the auto giants, Japanese Electrical company Hitachi has also set up its manufacturing facility of power equipment at Sanand.

Sterilisation deaths: Probe panel formed; drug firm boss  son heldA single-member commission under retired judge Anita Jha was constituted on Friday to probe the botched sterilisation surgeries at Bilaspur's government-run medical camps that have so far claimed lives of 13 women and left nearly 138 ill.
 
As Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh came under attack over the deaths and allegations of spurious drugs being given, the director of a drug company, which allegedly supplied sub-standard medicines that were administered to the victims, and his son were arrested in state capital Raipur.
 
"A single-member probe commission has been constituted and retd. District and sessions Judge Anita Jha has been entrusted with the responsibility of investigating the case of sterilisation surgeries at Sankri (Pendari), Gaurela, Pendra and Marwahi areas of Bilaspur district, where 13 women died and several fell critically ill after undergoing surgery," a government statement said.
 
The commission has been asked to submit its report to the state government within three months, it said.
 
CM Singh had on Thursday announced an unbiased and transparent judicial probe into the incidents following which, the General Administration Department issued a notification last evening regarding formation of the panel.
 
The CM, meanwhile, rejected the Congress' demand for his resignation. "Will by resignation resolve this issue. This is no option. Congress is only trying to politicise the issue," he said.
 
While 83 women were operated upon at Nemichand Jain Cancer and Research Centre at Pendari village of Takhatpur block on November 8, around 56 women underwent surgeries at three different camps in Pendra block on November 10.
 
The commission will investigate the case on number of points, including if standard protocol was followed at these camps, circumstances that led to the incident, whether medicines used at the camps were of standard quality, who are those accountable for this incident, measures that can be taken to avoid recurrence of such incidents and others, the statement added.
 
Mahawar Pharma Pvt Ltd's director Ramesh Mahwar and his son Sumit have been arrested under section 420 for cheating, based on a complaint lodged by Food and Drug Administration authorities, Raipur SP OP Pal told PTI.

The FDA had on Thursdsay sealed a manufacturing unit of the company which supplied an antibiotic drug used at sterilisation camps in Bilaspur district.
 
During the raid, a significant quantity of drugs were found burnt at the premises of Mahawar Pharma, official sources in the drugs control department had said.
 
After preliminary examination of the samples of the medicines collected from the pharmaceutical unit, drug inspector Tripti Jain lodged a case against the promoters following which the action was taken.
 
The department had on Thursday evening also raided a unit of another pharmaceuticals company in Bilaspur, which too had allegedly supplied some medicines to the sterilisation camps in the district, and collected drug samples from there for testing.
 
The state government has suspended sale of six drugs used in tubectomy surgeries at these sterilisation camps.
 
Putting the onus for the botch up on officers, the CM said they did not follow the guidelines issued by the state. "We will not spare anyone," he said.
 
"Surgeries were conducted in unhygienic condiditons," he said, adding, "We are probing whether drugs given were spurious."
 
Laparoscopic surgeon Dr RK Gupta of Bilaspur district hospital, who is accused of carrying out tubectomy procedures on 83 women at a camp at Pendari village in a matter of few hours, was arrested on Wednesday.
 
Gupta and Bilaspur's chief medical and health officer Dr RK Bhange were later dismissed from service by the state government.

Haryana man  who was thrown out of Bhavnagar hospital diesPrint
By: Express News Service | Rajkot | Posted: November 14, 2014 6:53 pm
Two days after he was thrown out of a government hospital in Bhavnagar despite being too weak to even speak, a Haryana man died while undergoing treatment late on Friday morning with district authorities saying strong action will be taken against two doctors who had been suspended thereon.
The man, who was identified as “Satish” from Haryana, had struggled his way to Sir Takhtasinji General Hospital (STGH) of Bhavnagar late Monday night. While junior resident doctor Ramakrishna Darji admitted the man, senior resident doctor Smit Darji ordered the patient be removed from the hospital premises after primary treatment.
Acting on this order, Suresh Babubhai, a contract employee tasked with sweeping and cleaning, put Satish on a stretcher and dumped him in a nullah near Pill Garden at around 2 am on Tuesday, hospital authorities say. However, he was brought back to the hospital by onlookers and admitted again to general surgical ward of the same hospital within half an hour.
“We had shifted the patient from general surgical ward to ICU (intensive care unit) of surgical ward on Thursday evening after his condition deteriorated. However, the cellulitis infection had spread too deep in his body system and it lead to him developing septicemia. The patient died at 10:30 am on Tuesday while undergoing treatment,” additional medical superintendent of STGH, Dr Aravind Sisodia told The Indian Express.
Dr Sisodia said that the man, who is believed to be around 30, had no relatives in Bhavangar and when he came to hospital, he was physically too weak to even speak.
“At the time he was hospitalised, there was just a small ulcer on his left forearm and a few maggots inside it. But he was very lean and thin with very low immunity. We had been administering heavy doses of antibiotics but the patient did not respond to the treatment,” Dr Jitendra Ruparel, resident medical officer (RMO) of STGH said.
The treatment meted out by the doctors had triggered public outrage forcing the hospital authorities to suspend the two doctors for a month the same day while terminating the sweeper.
But Bhavnagar collector Pravin Solanki said this was not enough. “It is not the question of the type of treatment the patient was given but the inhuman behaviour by the doctors. We have already written to the dean of Bhavnagar Medical college saying mere suspension for one month is not enough and that sever punishment should be meted out to the erring doctors. We have reported the matter to the Chief Minister’s Office also,” the collector said on Friday.
Solanki said that district administration too did not have much information about the man from Haryana.
Dr Sisodiya also said the two resident doctors were at fault. “The doctors must have thought that curing the ulcer might prove a tedious job and therefore they tried to get rid of the patient. However, they forgot the call of duty in doing so. This is very unfortunate incident for the entire medical fraternity,” he said.
The RMO said they were waiting for the post-mortem report continued…

Comet craft starts drilling; location still ...Comet craft Philae lander starts drilling; location still sought

Two harpoons that should have anchored the washing machine-sized Philae to the surface did not properly deploy when it hit the comet.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BERLIN: A European probe has begun drilling into a comet to collect scientific data, but mission controllers said Friday that battery issues may make it impossible _ at least for now _ to access that information.
The Philae lander on Wednesday became the first spacecraft to touch down on a comet and has since sent its first images from the surface of the body, known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
But two harpoons that should have anchored the washing machine-sized Philae to the surface did not properly deploy when it hit the comet.
That caused the lander to bounce off the comet and drift through the void for two hours before touching down again. After a second, smaller bounce, scientists believe it came to rest in a shallow crater on the comet's 2{-mile (4-kilometer) -wide body, or nucleus.
European Space Agency mission control still has not been able to locate the probe, but it's believed to be next to a cliff that is blocking sunlight from its solar panels.
That means the probe has been operating on battery power, which is expected to soon run out.
Philippe Gaudon, an ESA project manager, said that by using that power, Philae was able to successfully deploy its drill and bore 25 centimeters (about 10 inches) into the comet's surface to start collecting samples.
``So the mechanism has worked, but unfortunately we have lost the link and we have no more data,'' he told reporters in an online briefing.
Stephan Ulamec, head of operations for Philae, said right now it was unknown whether battery power would be sufficient to link back up with the probe.
``Maybe the battery will be empty before we get contact again,'' he said.
Meantime, he said the probe is receiving ``very limited power'' from its solar panels and project engineers are trying to determine how they might move the panels so that they receive more sunlight.
Communication with the lander is slow, with signals taking more than 28 minutes to travel between Earth and Philae's mother ship, the Rosetta orbiter flying above the comet.

The Iran Rosewater wont show youBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 14 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
Kim Bodnia, left, and Gael Garcia Bernal in a scene from “Rosewater.” (Laith Al-Majali/Open Road Films via Associated Press)
“Rosewater,” Jon Stewart’s directorial debut about the 2009 detention of Iran-Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari (Gael García Bernal) that opens this weekend, is an undeniably serious movie, but one that makes excellent use of Stewart’s fine-tuned sense of humor.
After Bahari was jailed while covering the Iranian elections, in part because of an appearance he made on Stewart’s “The Daily Show,” much of the film is taken up with an extended series of interrogations. And while the scenes are occasionally brutal, they are often hilarious, even deeply silly. “The American government does not control Newsweek magazine,” Bahari tries to convince his jailer (Kim Bodnia) at one point. “To be honest, it’s not even worth anything anymore. The weekly model of magazines, it doesn’t work.” At another, the man demands to know “Who is Anton Chekhov?” “Anton Chekhov the playwright?” Bahari says, surprised. “You tell me. It is you who have listed an interest in him on Facebook,” his interrogator replies, confident he has caught Bahari in some kind of deception.
But for all “Rosewater” simultaneously lionizes Bahari and deftly probes the way his jailer is also caught up in the terrible machine of the Iranian state, the movie made me wish mostly that Stewart’s audience might find itself drawn to the work of Iranian filmmakers and journalists. I am thinking specifically of Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, the filmmaker whose movie “Tales” has lingered with me long after the Toronto International Film Festival. “Tales” does not yet have a release date in the United States, which is a shame, and certainly one positive after-effect of “Rosewater” might be for it to find a distributor.
Like “Rosewater,” Bani-Etemad’s movie is about a journalist — sort of. Habib Rezaei plays a man with a camera who wanders in and out of the movie’s vignettes, catching a ride from the airport with cabdriver Abbas, shooting a story at a shelter for women recovering from drug addiction where one of the employees, Nargess, hides from her abusive husband. “Sir, who do you show these films to? And if they see them, so what?” Mrs. Touba, who is trying to get her son out of jail, demands of the cameraman, reminding him, and us, that life goes on once the camera is off and the audience has turned its attention elsewhere.
Movies about censorship or repression such as “Rosewater” always really have the regime that they are criticizing as a main character. By contrast, the short stories that make up “Tales” are relentlessly personal.  And they end up providing a much broader portrait of life in Iran (and life in general) than a movie like “Rosewater” possibly could, even though Bahari’s sources do widen the lens somewhat.
“Don’t you have a brother to keep from doing this?” the cabbie asks a prostitute who he reluctantly agrees to take on as a fare. “I don’t have a brother, and I don’t have time for preaching,” the woman tells him.
At the shelter, Nargess begs the director not to turn her out when her abusive husband shows up at the door. “I’ll work here as a slave, just don’t let him take me,” she pleads. “Just because you’re the husband, you can do whatever you want?” the shelter director scolds the man, who seems pathetic. But when Nargess finally ventures out to speak to the man, he has a charisma that is bound up in and fueled by pathos and menace. “How could I do this to those eyes?” he moans. “For God’s sake, come back to me, Nargess. I don’t have anyone but you.” It is harder to think of a better summary of the dynamics of domestic violence in a single scene.
In other vignettes, characters try to work around profound failures of communication. Reza, an illiterate factory worker, becomes convinced that a letter to his wife is proof that she is having an affair. But because he cannot read it, he can find out the truth only by demanding that she explain its contents, letting his suspicion (and feelings of inadequacy about their jobs) poison their relationship before he even knows whether he has cause.
In another, a young couple talk their way around something that might prevent them from having the romantic relationship they so badly desire, unable until the last moment to speak the words out loud.
Censorship matters, certainly. But so do the voices speaking so quietly that the censors never know they are there to be silenced.

Rosettas missing Philae lander is frantically doing improvised science  even as its batteries dieBy Rachel Feltman November 14 Follow @rachelfeltman
Philae's first panorama, with the lander's position illustrated. (ESA/Rosetta/Philae/CIVA)
Less than two days after its historic landing, Rosetta's probe may be reaching its final hours, and the scientific team is racing to collect as much data as possible before Philae's batteries run out. It's do or die, and at this point there's very little to lose in terms of its lifespan.
As the mission team announced on Thursday, Philae's bumpy landing left it in a shadowy spot. Its solar panels aren't being exposed to nearly enough light to keep the lander going, and it left Earth with only a 60-hour charge. In all likelihood, Philae's batteries will die sometime Friday evening.
A European probe has begun drilling into a comet to collect scientific data, but mission controllers said Friday that battery issues may make it impossible to access that information. (AP)
And no, we aren't sure where it is.
"We still could not exactly identify where Philae is at this very moment," said Stephan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager, at a media briefing on Friday morning. He and other scientists hope they'll pinpoint Philae's location with new information they'll receive Friday evening, but by then it may be too late to try to move the probe.
But the probe is doing some speedy science in the meantime: In the media briefing, the Rosetta team said that several new instruments were now operational. MUPUS, which is a penetrator that hammers into the surface, was activated Thursday night. This was a controversial move, scientists worried it might push Philae into an even more precarious position. But with time running out, they made the call to turn the hammer on.
Philae's X-ray spectrometer, which should reveal some clues about the comet's molecular composition, is also running. And as of the team's last contact with the probe (which is interrupted for many hours a day because of the comet's rotation), Philae's drill is also on. We don't know yet whether this tool has actually succeeded in penetrating the surface and taking samples.
The next information from Philae will come around 8 p.m. Eastern time Friday, after the mission team receives its next packet of data from the satellite link. In the meantime, scientists are analyzing the last data packet -- including information from MUPUS -- as we write this.
The next data packet will also include a whole host of new photos.
"We're still awaiting the descent images...and the images from the first touchdown to touchdown plus two hours. These images aren't down yet," said Holger Sierks, who oversees the OSIRIS camera, at the Friday media briefing.
These images are expected to show Philae's bounce, which would help the team figure out where it ended up. "So hopefully...we'll soon be in the position to know where it hides," Sierks said.

When Gravity Fails: my new article on Israel and the ICCBy Eugene Kontorovich November 14
The International Criminal Court’s decision to not pursue a referral by Comoros against Israel, discussed here yesterday , was based on the requirement that the Court only deal with situations of particular “gravity” – that is, the worst of the world’s worst conduct.
As it happens, my new article — When Gravity Fails: Israeli Settlements and Admissibility at the ICC — has just been published in the Israel Law Review. It focusses on operationalizing the fuzzy gravity requirement, and applying it in the context of other possible situations involving Israel.  Here is the abstract:
In the wake of the UN General Assembly’s recent recognition of Palestinian statehood, the Palestinian government has made clear its intention to challenge in the International Criminal Court (ICC or the Court) the legality of Israeli settlements. This article explores jurisdictional hurdles for such a case. To focus on the jurisdictional issues, the article assumes for the sake of argument the validity of the merits of the legal claims against the settlements.
The ICC only takes situations of particular ‘gravity’. Yet settlements are not a ‘grave breach’ under the Rome Statute. No modern international criminal tribunal has ever prosecuted crimes that do not involve systematic violence and physical coercion. The ICC’s gravity measure involves the number of persons killed; for settlements it would be zero. Indeed, the ICC Prosecutor triages situations by the numbers of victims; settlements do not appear to have direct individual victims. Finally, the ICC would at most have jurisdiction over settlement activity only from the date of Palestine’s acceptance of jurisdiction. Settlement activity in this time frame would not immediately cross the ICC’s gravity threshold.
Cambridge University Press is making it available without a subscription until the end of the year.

Threat to health subsidies could force state s hand to create exchange2
Legislators and interested groups are tweaking the proposal and plan to start moving a revised bill through the process next week, Gabel said.
In Illinois, the subsidies have lowered individual monthly premiums by an average of $202, leaving the average monthly payment around $114, according to a federal report. About 168,000 of the 217,000 Illinois residents who signed up for Obamacare during its first open enrollment period a year ago qualified for the subsidies.
Rep. Patti Bellock, a Hinsdale Republican, said she doubts the proposal will have enough support to reach the House floor. She said she opposes the proposal because of the cost of maintaining an exchange.
"In the situation we're in right now, with the budget being so bad, we thought, 'Why are we going to take on any more expense?'" Bellock said.
If the Supreme Court decides against the subsidies, it would be up to the federal government to find a solution for all the states affected, she said.
"I think this isn't just an Illinois problem," Bellock said. "I would think that this would be a federal problem."
Bellock's concerns were echoed by the Illinois Policy Institute, a free-market group that has been critical of the federal health law. "This is really a cost that Illinois just can't afford to take on, especially given our current budget situation," said Naomi Lopez Bauman, director of health policy for the institute.
Gabel's proposal would tax insurers to fund the exchange.
The 2011 report suggested a range of options to pay the annual costs, from taxing consumers to taxing insurers to drawing on general state funds. Lopez Bauman raised a concern that if the state were to tax insurers, the costs would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums.
"Either way you look at it, taxpayers will be footing the bill for this into perpetuity," she said.
Phillips, of the Campaign for Better Health Care, who spent last year helping consumers navigate the exchanges and select plans, said a state-run exchange would give Illinois more power to implement "pro-consumer regulations." Options could include limiting rates and the number of plans on an exchange, Phillips said. In 2015, for example, Illinois is offering 410 plans, up from 165 last year.
"You could say there has to be a meaningful difference between plans," she said. "When consumers have hundreds of plans, that's overwhelming."
Basic things like design, too, could be better, Phillips said. The state would also have access to enrollment data in real time, instead of waiting on the federal government to release figures.
"Why deny consumers in Illinois the help that they need?" Phillips said. "Why deny them the kind of website they really need to make informed, sound decisions? This is one of the most important decisions they will make."

Myers v. United States and presidential acquiescenceBy Will Baude November 14
On Thursday I wrote about the exchange over signing statements in Zivotofsky. Among other things, oral argument included the following:
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we should give no weight to the fact that the Chief Executive signed the law that he is now saying has such a dramatic — that his successor, but I gather the position is the same — is now saying has such deleterious effects on American foreign policy? Well, as a general matter, does that have any consequence at all?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I mean, I think this Court held — I think this Court held in Myers that the fact that one President signed a law into — signed a law that violated separation of powers doesn’t have any effect.
For reasons that Chief Justice John Roberts elaborated (and I discussed Thursday ), there might be specific reasons that the president’s decision to sign a law with an unconstitutional provision does demonstrate something about the gravity of the unconstitutional provision. But here the solicitor general is invoking a more general proposition.
Josh Blackman asks about the source of this general proposition :
I think the Solicitor General is referring to Myers v. United States–the removal case–but that case is not cited anywhere in the government’s brief. I’m afraid I don’t know where it says that in Myers. What law was signed in Myers? It involved the removal of an officer? I’ve read the case a number of times, but can’t recall. If you know, please add a citation to the comments.
I think it’s this passage, from page 170 of Chief Justice William Howard Taft’s opinion in Myers :
In spite of the foregoing Presidential declarations, it is contended that, since the passage of the Tenure of Office Act, there has been general acquiescence by the Executive in the power of Congress to forbid the President alone to remove executive officers — an acquiescence which has changed any formerly accepted constitutional construction to the contrary. Instances are cited of the signed approval by President Grant and other Presidents of legislation in derogation of such construction. We think these are all to be explained not by acquiescence therein, but by reason of the otherwise valuable effect of the legislation approved. Such is doubtless the explanation of the executive approval of the Act of 1876, which we are considering, for it was an appropriation act on which the section here in question was imposed as a rider.
So that’s the source of the general principle that the solicitor general refers to, for what it’s worth.

Rich tradition, poor response

Dinesh Ray on lesser known music traditions of the Koch Rajbongshi community
Dinesh Ray, a researcher and collector of ancient instruments of the Koch Rajbongshi people, is a treasure house of rare knowledge, while his daughter Anindita Ray plays a number of these instruments. She also sings and dances in performances of fading traditions such as Tukkha gaan, Jugi gaan and others.
The father and daughter, who live in Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, were in New Delhi recently along with their group to perform music and dance at a seminar on Koch Rajbongshi History and Cultural Tradition.
“I started recording these traditions for LPs and EPs in 1984,” says Ray. “Before this, Harish Chandra Pal was the only person who made such recordings. He died in 1982, and after him there was no one.”
It was hard at first to convince a recording label to sign him, as he was an unknown entity to them. “They would say, you do the recording at your own cost, but I said I am an ordinary schoolteacher — how can I invest so much?” Finally, the recording company Kiran agreed to back him. “And I am still with them,” says Ray with satisfaction.
The albums do sell well enough to cover their costs, he notes. The village artists who perform are given a one-time recording fee.
The music is not tampered with to make it fit popular trends. “We keep it pure.”
The ancient Koch Rajbongshi kingdom stretched across a region that today is divided between India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. In India, the Koch Rajbongshi community hails from places like North Bengal, parts of Assam, Bihar, Meghalaya, etc.
As his daughter demonstrates how to play the instruments in their collection, also singing along, Ray names them and explains how they may differ from similar ones in other traditions.
There are two types of dotara. One has four strings while the other has five strings.
“The four-string dotara is used in Bhavaiyya singing, and the five-string one is used in Baul singing.”
Then there is the khamak. “We use the one-string khamak in Tukkha gaan,” says Ray. This is a form from the Tantrik tradition. “The Bauls use a khamak with two strings.”
The reference to the Bauls is significant because, as Ray points out, there was a time when their music too was largely unknown to the world, whereas now they are popularly recognised in many countries. If people take similar interest in propagating the Koch Rajbongshi traditions, they too might become well known and prosperous once more.
Another rare instrument is the sarinja. Of its three strings, one is made of cotton while the other two are of steel. A bowed instrument, its body is made of jackfruit wood and is carved with Tantrik symbols that can be found in stone carvings in Jalpaiguri district, says Ray.
The bena is made of the body of a bamboo and its bowl too is made of bamboo. This too is a bowed instrument. The bena, remarks Ray, is known as the Ravana veena in South India, the pena in Manipur and the tendra in Purulia.
There are kartals made of bamboo, of which many versions can be found across India. But among the most intriguing instruments is the ancient jugi jantra, which looks like a narrow fret board resting on two fragile pumpkin gourds.
The jugi jantra accompanies Jugi gaan. Anindita is trained in both under Dinesh Debnath of Paanbaari village. “He is very old now and has no other disciples except Anindita. There is no one else who practises this art. No one patronises it, so the art vanishes,” says Ray.
Though he is a teacher of Bengali, he hails from a family of artists and was exposed to theatre and other arts from childhood. His wife Dipti too comes from a tradition of performers. “Dipti and Anindita are the only performers of Tukkha gaan,” he adds. Similarly, states Ray, they are the only known players of the sarinja.
It was a chance meeting with Masa Oki Onishi, a professor of linguistics, at the 1977 All India Folklore Congress in Calcutta that set Ray on the path of an archivist. “He encouraged me to collect these songs,” says Ray who also ran a Rajbongshi language paper for 15 years.
“In 1978, I started collecting various types of songs of the Rajbongshi community. There is Pala gaan, a drama form, Mantra gaan, Medir gaan — a female tradition — and various folks songs of the region. Many of them are vanishing. I have tried to store them in a hard disk.”
Dipti is an A-grade artist of All India Radio while Anindita is graded B. Nowadays, however, recordings on AIR are a vanishing tradition too, the oft-heard reason being the national broadcaster is strapped for funds. Is it surprising then that Anindita is pursuing a Masters degree in Bangla though she has studied classical music and would have like to take a degree in music? With Bengali she can at least get a job as a teacher, maintains the father, whose own higher studies were a casualty in the turmoil caused by the then Naxalite movement.
A Japanese and a Russian film have been made on the Koch Rajbonghsi traditions, says Ray.
In India though, beyond Jalpaiguri, the artists have been invited to perform only in Kolkata and Delhi. For a country that takes pride in its art and culture, India has certainly become adept at ignoring its heritage.
It is another matter that culture comes in handy to feed the fire, with differences in traditions used to enlarge the fissures within communities. But otherwise, art and artists are left to languish.
“The poor,” Ray is forced to conclude, “will always remain poor.”

Get Covered: Four Groups Who Need life insuranceEmail
Today there are more single mothers, female breadwinners and stay-at-home dads than there were even a decade ago. Many couples are buying homes later — and having to make mortgage payments into their 50s and 60s. Many parents are having children later. So moms and dads may be facing surging college tuition bills at the same time that they're helping to care for their own aging parents.
Changing family needs impact not only day-to-day money matters but also plans for how to protect your loved ones' financial futures. Being properly insured is essential. Here are four groups that probably need life insurance the most:
Breadwinners: “If anyone in your life depends on you financially, you need life insurance,” says Marvin Feldman, CEO of consumer advocacy group LifeHappens.org. Increasingly, women are becoming the primary breadwinners in their households, so wives will need to have more coverage than their husbands. The number of women who are their families' sole or primary breadwinner has soared to 40 percent today from 11 percent in 1960, according to Pew Research Center. You may get life insurance policies through your employer, but the coverage is usually lower than individual policies and is only in place while you're employed.
Stay-at-home parents: If you have children, both parents should have life insurance, including the mom or dad who stays at home. Calculate the cost of services that a stay-at-home parent provides — childcare, caring for the home, transportation — in determining the amount of coverage needed. Financial adviser Carolyn McClanahan of Life Planning Partners says she advises working parents to also consider loss of income if they were to take time away from their job after the death of a stay-at-home spouse.  "If someone dies who is the center of the household and the center of your world, it makes it difficult to work,” she says. "Do you have resources to take time off and decompress while you readjust?"
Sharon answered viewer's life insurance questions in a live Twitter chat using #GetAPlan.
Older couples: Does it make sense to pay life insurance premiums in your 50s and 60s? If you have kids in college or adult children living at home, you may want to make sure they'll have some financial support if you're gone. Empty nesters who may have a mortgage and don't want to burden their spouse with this expense if they die will need life insurance too. "You should consider making sure you get enough life insurance to cover paying off the mortgage, continuing to pay for college, and potentially invest in life insurance that would allow your spouse to get a steady stream of income in the future," says Byron Udell, CEO of Accuquote.com.
Single moms: More than 40 percent of babies in the U.S. are born to women who are unmarried — that's a 10-percentage-point increase in the past decade, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Most of these women are in their 20s and 30s. Millennial moms may think they’re too young to buy life insurance, but financial advisers say new parents often need life insurance the most.

Consumer Watchdog Eyes Prepaid Cards for CrackdownPrepaid cards eyed for crackdown by consumer watchdog
Kelley Holland CNBC
Email
Candice Choi / AP
Prepaid cards are exploding in popularity but some are profiting on hidden fees and murky rules. So the government's biggest consumer watchdog is proposing some rules to get the industry in line.
Unlike a credit card, these cards are loaded with funds by a consumer, employer, a government agency, or another third party. The amount loaded on general purpose reloadable prepaid cards increased from $19.5 billion in 2008 to an estimated $98.6 billion this year, according to Mercator Advisory Group.  JPMorgan Chase ,  U.S. Bank and  American Express are all active in the business.
Many prepaid cards users are people without bank accounts or who can't get credit, but some consumers also find them useful for sticking to a budget. Parents sometimes give teens or college-age children prepaid cards so they can keep tabs on where they are spending money
The new rules are designed to clear up some confusion in the burgeoning prepaid card market.
"Our proposal would close the loopholes in this market and ensure prepaid consumers are protected whether they are swiping a card, scanning their smartphone, or sending a payment," Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Richard Cordray said in a statement released Thursday.
A number of federal regulatory agencies have applied rules to certain types of issuers or cards, but the regulation of the industry has been piecemeal. "The agencies themselves have not been coherent in the way they have looked at prepaid cards," said Ben Jackson, director of Mercator's prepaid advisory service.
Jackson warned that if the new rules create "a situation where the regulators are inflexible and require a lot of effort on the part of providers to meet needs that the customers don't have, then the regulations will be harmful." But he said a clearer set of rules could reduce uncertainty in the prepaid card market.
The CFPB's proposed rules would address several aspects of card usage. For example, all prepaid card issuers are not currently required to provide regular account statements, but the new rules would call for online statements to be issued.
The new measures would also limit consumers' exposure if their card is lost, stolen, or fraudulently used. Right now, consumers have such protections for their credit cards, but not for prepaid cards.
The rules would also establish ways for consumers to work with card issuers to resolve any errors on their accounts.
New "Know Before You Owe" disclosures would show the fees associated with prepaid cards in a systematic way. As the rules stand now, there are no universal requirements for how card issuers disclose their fees, making it hard for consumers to  comparison shop .
The bureau is also proposing protections for consumers who have set up prepaid card accounts that let them pay more than they have loaded on the cards. Some issuers of these cards use the next funds the consumer loads on the card to pay off the overdraft and any associated fees. The bureau proposes forcing these card issuers to follow the same practices as credit card companies.
The prepaid card issuers currently "don't comply with credit card laws, but of course it is credit," said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.
"Prepaid cards fill an important niche to help consumers who have had trouble with bank accounts or just want to control spending," she said. They can also be a useful way for employers to pay employees who do not have bank accounts. "They can be very useful and convenient for consumers, but right now the protections are uncertain and there are abusive practices on some cards." The new protections, she said, "will give consumers and employers more confidence."
The proposed rules will be open for comment for 90 days after they are published in the Federal Register.

Recommend holding on to long positions: Mitesh Thacker
ET Now Nov 14, 2014, 06.02PM IST
In a chat with ET Now, Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com, shares his views on market outlook.
ET Now: While we may have just theoretically closed in at a record high 8389 odd levels what is the sense that you are getting about how next week is going to be?
Mitesh Thacker: Similar kind of movement might still continue slightly subdued but yet positively biased. What traders need to look is some kind of threat of reversal or profit booking happening. So as long as we are not breaking 8320, I would suggest holding on to long positions.
One of these days we might have a breakout which might be stronger, which might see a broader participation and then we may look at a quick upside but for the time being it remains upwardly or positively biased market but with some kind of slow pace.

Advani: Sena  JD(U) responsible for breaking ties | No regret for not becoming PMBJP
(Shiv Sena severed its 25-year-ties…)
PATNA: Senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani today said old companions Shiv Sena and JD(U) did not heed his suggestion and went ahead to break ties with BJP with the hope to gain but the poll outcome has proved them wrong.
"When Uddhav Thackeray decided to go alone in the Maharashtra assembly polls, I personally called him and told him this will not be appropriate as Shiv Sena was among the founder members of NDA. I requested him to reconsider his decision and stay with us, but he did not accept," Advani told reporters.
"We do not break alliances when any party comes with us. We wanted the alliance with Shiv Sena to continue. But it seems Uddhav did not like my request. He thought his party will be better off if it goes alone. This ended the 25-year-old alliance that had continued since the days of Atal Behari Vajpayee," Advani added.
Shiv Sena severed its 25-year-ties with NDA in September this year after differences arose over seat sharing in Maharashtra assembly polls.
Advani was in Patna to attend a function at a school run by a former IPS officer J K Sinha for students of Musahar community.
The 87-year-old veteran pointed out that even in the case of senior JD (U) leader and former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar severing ties with NDA, similar thing happened.
"When Nitish Kumar invited Narendra Modi for dinner during BJP national executive in Patna in 2010 and then cancelled the invitation, I told him that he was among the founder members of the NDA, and should not do this, but he did not oblige," Advani said.
The BJP leader, who is a former Deputy Prime Minister said he had personally invited Kumar to come to BJP national executive in Mumbai in 1998 and he was among the persons who started the NDA.
"I had gone to invite George Fernandes , then recuperating in Jaslok Hospital. Nitish Kumar was there and I invited him too. He came to our national executive. He came and that's how NDA started. When he was breaking away from the alliance, I requested him not to do so but he did not accept my appeal," Advani added.
The BJP stalwart also said, "There was no breaking away from the alliance during Vajpayee's time", but the phenomenon has gathered momentum recently as allies think they will perform better if they contest elections on their own.
"However, BJP is not losing ground in Bihar. I see important political changes happening in the country and hope its affect will be visible not only in Bihar, but also all over India," Advani added.
He pointed out that the concept of 'coalition politics and government' has changed now and the belief that we were in its (coalition) age has lost its moorings.

CPI (Maoist) claim onus for attack on NGIL corporate office inKochiPolice officials inspecting the office of Nitta Gelatin India Limited (NGIL), which was attacked in a suspected Maoist attack in Kochi on Monday.(Source: PTI)
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: November 14, 2014 7:38 pm
The CPI (Maoist) on Friday took responsibility for the attack on the corporate office of Nitta Gelatin India Limited (NGIL) in Kochi on last Monday.
A press note released by the Western Ghat Zonal Committee of the CPI (Maoist) in Thrissur said the urban action team under the committee carried out the attack.
Going by the claim of the Maoists, the attack on NGIL corporate office, located in the prime spot in Kochi, would be the organisation’s first sortie into a Kerala city.
NGIL’s unit in Thrissur district, which manufactures ossein from animal bone, has been facing protests over polluting a nearby river. A nine-member gang, wearing masks, stormed into the corporate office after threatening the security staff. Using iron rods, they demolished the computers and window panes. They also left a letter, which has reference to Maoists, forcing the police to suspect the involvement of the ultra outfit.
The press release in Thrissur said the attack on NGIL was a symbolic action and was a warning to the company to withdraw from its anti-people stand. If the company does not take a cue from this action, the coming actions would not be just symbolic.
It said past experience showed the irrelevance of nonviolence means of agitation. Police had brutally tortured the people who had been engaged in a peaceful agitation. The atrocities committed by the company towards the local people in terms of exploitation, pollution and social loss is thousand fold than the loss created by our attack on the NGIL office.
The release called for a people’s fight to gain supremacy over water and forest.
NGIL, an Indo-Japanese venture, is a leading manufacturer of gelatin, ossein, di-calcium phosphate, collagen peptide and related products which have wide applications in pharmaceuticals. The NGIL’s unit in Thrissur was attacked last year in connection with the agitation against polluting river Chalakkudy.
In the last two years, there had been unconfirmed reports about the presence of Maoists in the hilly regions of North Kerala, bordering Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Despite massive mobilization of the forces and combing operations in the region, nothing has been yielded yet.
In July this year, a prominent Maoist leader Sinoj was killed while making bombs in an undisclosed forest region.

Thirudan Police works best in the comic bitsUpdated: November 15, 2014 18:42 IST
Thirudan Police works best in the comic bits
Sudhir Srinivasan
Tamil cinema
Thirudan Police screams identity crisis. Like its hero, it doesn’t quite know what it wants to be. Like a thief pursued by cops, it changes directions unpredictably. It starts off hinting at a 7G Rainbow Colony type of love story, where the idle, good-for-nothing Vishwa (Attakaththi Dinesh) woos the new girl in the neighbourhood (Iyshwarya Rajesh). Like the Selvaraghavan film, it explores father-son issues, with the policeman father (yesteryear actor Rajesh) wanting to make something of his son, who for his part is content watching night shows with money stolen from dad’s wallet. Police dad, thirudan son.
Then, the film takes a serious turn. It switches almost into expository mode and takes on shades of a Bhandarkar film, as it begins to show the life of a constable and the harsh realities of police work. Buying vegetables for a senior officer, running errands for his family, standing for hours under the sun without food… you get the idea. This is interspersed with monologues about the pride in being a policeman and cracks about policing. “Always pick on hatchbacks, never sedans,” advises a colleague.
Then, the movie becomes a revenge saga with Vishwa realising his father’s nobility and deciding to track down his killer (the hilarious Rajendran). Vishwa’s singular objective is to bring this man to justice. However, that’s not too difficult because both of them are almost always in the vicinity of each other, thanks to the miracle of coincidences. Perhaps it’s the universe, as Paulo Coelho said in The Alchemist, conspiring to help Vishwa get what he wants.
Genre: Action-Drama-Comedy-Romance Director: Caarthick Raju Cast: Attakaththi Dinesh, Iyshwarya Rajesh, Aadukalam Naren, Rajendran Storyline: A constable seeks revenge for the murder of his father
Finally, the movie becomes a comedy, the best of all its avatars. The last 15 minutes leave you in splits — Rajendran’s mere presence evokes laughter. Just like someone moves from job to job before finally discovering what he’s good at, the film at last manages to identify its trump card.
Vishwa’s struggle to shed a tear following the death of his father in the beginning is a great touch. But you realise that Caarthick Raju’s real strength is comedy. A Ramarajan-style punch quite early in the film (where the fist passes through face after face leaving behind a trail of fallen bodies) signals this. The climax sequences confirm it. You’re happily willing to suspend all disbelief when the scenes are as funny as they are at the end.
And then, your laughter is brought to a screeching halt when the film brings in another monologue about the piety of policemen. Just before the end credits, there’s even a dedication to ‘all the fathers’. For a film that uses a son’s grief for laughs (not that it’s wrong), it’s quite an audacious dedication. Accompanying the end credits are pictures of the cast and crew with their respective fathers, Burma-style. As you walk out, you can’t but wonder if the director, after noting all the laughter at the end, rues his decision not to have made a full-fledged comedy.

Mobile data subscribers to reach 501 million...CLSA
(India's smartphone penetration…)
NEW DELHI: Mobile data subscribers in the country are expected to grow over two times to reach 501 million by 2017-18 led by increasing consumer engagement with mobile phones, availability of low-cost smartphones and expansion of data networks, a report has said.
"We project mobile data subscribers to expand from 198 million as of FY14 to 501 million by FY18 and data traffic to jump sevenfold, making mobile data a compelling Rs 883 billion ($ 15 billion) annual revenue opportunity," global brokerage firm CLSA said in a report.
The firm said handsets are becoming the primary means for accessing the internet and mobile data usage is surging as social networking, music, email, video and m-commerce attract all categories of subscribers.
"Fuelling the expansion of data traffic are low-cost smartphones, which have only just begun to replace feature phones; and at 13 per cent penetration there is a huge pent-up demand," it added.
CLSA said social media has also been instrumental in driving engagement. Giving an example, it said there are over 108 million active Facebook users in India and that figure is growing at over 20 million per year.
"Interestingly, nearly 75 per cent of those users access the site through mobile devices," it said.
The report said smartphones have lowered the entry barrier to internet access significantly as they are available for 30 per cent of the cost of a personal computer ($ 50, versus $ 170) and just 3 per cent of per-capita income, making them extremely affordable.
"Leading manufacturers are sensing this growth opportunity in the affordable smartphone market and have lined up multiple offerings in the $ 30-100 price range," it added.
India's smartphone penetration of 13 per cent is still very low, but the market is seeing an expanding range of both affordable and high-end devices.
"We expect smartphone penetration to triple over 2014-18 to 41 per cent, driven by the increasing availability of affordable smartphones," the report said.
Along with the increasing availability of affordable smartphones, the acceleration of data-network rollouts by mobile operators is also driving mobile data adoption, it added.

Home is where the address proof is
BISHWANATH GHOSH
human interest
I came to live in Chennai 14 years ago with Rs. 40,000 of my father’s hard-earned money, which remained concealed throughout the train journey in a special pocket sewn onto my vest by my mother (at that time, electronic transfer of money was unheard of and ATMs were almost non-existent).
 I was aware that landlords in Chennai usually demand 10 months' rent in advance; and I had no one to turn to except my father, who nursed an unexplained fondness for the city and was happy to help his son settle down there.
 It took me about 10 days to find a house to my liking. By then the bundle of notes had thinned down to almost half. But fortunately for me, the landlord asked for only five months’ rent as deposit. With whatever little money was left after paying the broker, I bought a mattress and a pillow and — on February 1, 2001 — moved into Kamakoti Flats on Murugesan Street in T. Nagar. I formally became a resident of Chennai, with an address of my own.
 Kamakoti Flats has been my home ever since. This piece, needless to say, is being written in the building, in the same silence of the night that gave me company for 14 years. But by the time it appears in print, I would have moved out to another street nearby. The ‘packers and movers’ arrive tomorrow morning.
I am suddenly facing an identity crisis. Countless articles may have appeared under my byline; my name may appear on the spines of three books; but my identity is invalid without an ‘address proof’. For nearly every basic requirement in life — from opening a bank account to buying life insurance to getting a phone connection, not to mention applying for a loan — you need to prove that you reside in a certain address; and now that I am moving out of the address that had served as the proof of my identity for 14 years, I will have to start from scratch.
 And all this while, I toiled night after night, believing that I was building an identity for myself.

BJP Latehar candidate injured in roadaccidentThe BJP candidate's vehicle was on its way from Latehar to Balumath when the incident happened. (Source: Express photo by Deepu Sebastian Edmond)
By: Express News Service | Latehar | Posted: November 14, 2014 8:08 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 8:54 pm
 
BJP’s candidate from the Latehar assembly segment Brajmohan Ram had a narrow escape when the vehicle he was in collided with a coal truck on Friday afternoon, killing two members of his staff.
Ram survived with a fractured left arm and was being treated at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi. His personal assistant and bodyguard were killed, while a driver — the fourth person in the Mahindra Scorpio — suffered multiple injuries.
Ram, former Lok Sabha member from Palamu, was a eleventh-hour candidate, having been asked to contest by the party on the morning of the deadline to submit nomination papers. He replaced Narayan Bhokta, an alleged former Deputy Zonal Commander of banned LWE organisation TSPC, who was discovered to have at least one outstanding arrest warrant against him.
The BJP candidate’s vehicle was on its way from Latehar to Balumath, where Ram was to attend a campaign meeting presided over by Union Minister Jayant Sinha, when the incident happened. He was running 30 minutes late for the three o’clock event. Regional news organisations quoted eyewitness accounts to report that he was speeding when the accident occurred near Makaiyatand village.
Ram later alleged that it was an attempt on his life. “I am sure someone was trying to kill me. I don’t know who exactly,” he said. His supporters blocked the NH-99 for over an hour demanding the arrest of the driver of the truck, who has been absconding after the incident.

SAP  Oracle settle long-running legal disputeSAP, Oracle settle long-running legal dispute
AFP Nov 14, 2014, 08.06PM IST
(Oracle will accept $356.7…)
FRANKFURT: German software giant SAP has agreed to pay US rival Oracle more than $359 million (288 million euros) to settle a long-running copyright battle, it said on Friday.
"Oracle will accept $356.7 millions in compensation and interest payments rather than appeal again," SAP said in a statement.
Added to this sum was another $2.5 million in interest payments, a spokesman told AFP.
The two arch-rivals have been engaged in a fierce legal spat since 2007 related to TomorrowNow, SAP's former US subsidiary.
TomorrowNow had offered support to Oracle customers at a lower price than Oracle itself.
The US company accused SAP of stealing its software in order to be able to offer those services.
In November 2010, a US jury ordered SAP to pay the Silicon Valley giant $1.3 billion in damages. But the payment was subsequently dismissed as "grossly excessive" and slashed to $272 million.
Oracle rejected that amount and filed an appeal. The German group said it was "satisfied" that the court had finally accepted SAP's arguments to limit the amount of damages and that Oracle had agreed to put an end to the litigation.

Earnings | Tata Motors | State Bank | ONGCTata Motors says profit falls after domestic sales drop
ET Bureau Nov 15, 2014, 02.50AM IST

(Tata Motors Ltd, India's…)
MUMBAI: India's largest automobile company by revenues, Tata Motors posted a 7% decline in consolidated net profit for the second quarter ended September, missing the street estimates by a large margin.
Arecord high loss by its domestic operation coupled with revaluation of currency (£85 million), higher tax provision and increased depreciation cost at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) took a toll on the consolidated profits for the second quarter of FY15. The consolidated net profit for Q2 stood at Rs3,291 crore against Rs3,542 crore posted in the same period last year. The consolidated net revenues for the period grew 6.5% and the EBIDTA margin too expanded by 70 basis po ints to 17% in the quarter.
Reviewing the Q2 earnings C Ramakrishnan, CFO, Tata Motors said, as far as JLR is concerned, a higher tax provisioning and more importantly, JLR had a lot of new projects getting launched and the company is continuing to invest in lot of new products, so the depreciation and amortisation charge is also growing. "It is, however, a non-cash expenditure. Apart from this, there was a marginal revaluation of currency. Its domestic business had a certain amount of reversals of tax credits," said Ramakrishnan.
While JLR reported a healthy margin expansion of 190 basis points to a whopping 19.4% EBIDTA margins, a single digit growth in volumes, meant revenues were only marginally up 4.2% to £4,808 million (Rs46,455 crore) and PAT fell 11.24% to £450 million (Rs4,347.9 crore).
On the JLR front, the new models XE and Discovery Sport will help build the sales momentum in 2015 and the Chinese JV will start commercial production, which will help meet the demand in China more aggressively. The region makes up for over a quarter of sales for JLR.
Closer home the signs of a pick up in sentiment, has resulted in growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment, but the company says the real growth is only expected next year. And on the passenger vehicle front, a large part of its portfolio is struggling, with only saving grace being, the newly launched Zest, which the company claimed had a good response from the market with over 10,000 units sold so far. However, this had little impact on the standalone earnings.
On a standalone basis, the condition has turned from bad to worse. The standalone loss has more than doubled toRs1,846 crore, which is the highest ever loss in the company's history with a negative EBIDTA of Rs145 crore and a EBIDTA margin of which was a negative 1.7%.

After landing in Brisbane on Friday, PM Modi has received more than 3,000 suggestions/demands from people on what should be his talking-points at the gala public event at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on 17 November. Weeks ago, in a first-of-its-kind move, Modi had sought suggestions for the event through an open forum, especially from the Indian community in Australia.
Interestingly, Modi’s pet project Swachh Bharat, racial abuse of Indians and tourism invoked maximum response from participants.
“We can learn from Australia and implement the same in our Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. In return we can teach them Yoga, hospitality,” read one post at mygov.in, the online interface between the government and people.
In his address at MCG, Modi will share some of the ideas received and also reveal the names of those who shared the ideas.
People have also suggested him to promote cooperation in production and research in Ayurveda, skill development training in tourism and mining and partnership to tackle the drug menace.
There are also demands to talk with Australian authorities to “increase the scope of part time job for Indian students in Australia” and give a “quota for the children of NRIs in professional colleges in India.

DERC withdraws power tariff hike within 24 hrsAfter political attack, DERC withdraws power tariff hike within 24 hrs
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 14, 2014  | 15:30 IST
Facing severe attack from political parties, Delhi's power regulator DERC on Friday withdrew the power tariff hike of up to seven per cent which was announced last night.
The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission said the hike was rolled back "realising" that a number of power generation companies including NTPC, which supply electricity to the city, provided only part information about price of fuel such as coal and gas.
The DERC last night had announced re-introduction of the power purchase adjustment cost (PPAC) surcharge to effect an increase of tariff by up to seven per cent from Saturday.
BJP, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had slammed DERC for raising the tariff, demanding an immediate roll back, but DERC claimed that the decision to withdraw the hike was not due to criticism from the parties.
DERC chairperson P D Sudhakar said additional information on cost of producing of power from coal and gas-based power generating stations has been sought and a fresh decision on tariff will be taken within two weeks after examining the details.
"It has now been brought to the notice of the Commission that various generators including NTPC supplying power to Delhi have provided only part of the information regarding pricing of fuel and billing of power generated at their stations.
"Additional information has been called for, which is expected shortly which will have a direct bearing on the PPAC claims (by the discoms)," Sudhakar said.
Asked why the additional information on pricing of fuel and cost of power production was not sought earlier, he said the DERC had increased the tariff provisionally and now it felt that the detail costing of the generating stations should have been analysed before hiking the rates.
"We will take a decision on PPAC within next two weeks," said Sudhakar while claiming that decision was not revoked due to criticism from political parties.
Last night, the DERC had hiked the tariff by 7 per cent for consumers of BSES Yamuna Power and was fixed at 4.5 per cent for BSES Rajdhani. The hike for consumers of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd was 2.5 per cent.
Asked about the issue, Lt Governor Najeeb Jung only said the hike has been withdrawn.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn Power Purchase Adjustment Cost (PPAC) of around 8 per cent till October.
The regulator had introduced PPAC in 2012 to help the private power distribution companies recover additional cost on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
Delhi gets power from a number of gas and coal-based power generation plants.
The private power distribution companies, particularly, BRPL and BYPL, have been demanding significant hike in tariff, citing rise in power purchase cost.
The withdrawal of PPAC in July had resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
According to DERC figures, the private discoms operating in the city have a revenue gap of a whopping Rs 19,500 crore.
Official figures show that around 80-90 per cent of total revenue of discoms goes into purchasing power from central and state government owned entities through long-term power purchase agreement, at rates determined by the central and state regulators.
The city has seen a series of hike in power tariff in the past two years.
The tariff was hiked by 22 per cent in 2011 followed by five per cent hike in February 2012. The tariff was increased by up to two per cent in May 2012 year and again by 26 per cent for domestic consumers in July 2012.
It was hiked by up to three per cent in February last year and again by five per cent in August last.
The cost of buying power has increased primarily on account of an increase in the input prices of raw material like coal and gas, officials said.

Crossover vehicles Check out VW Polo Cross  Toyota Etios Cross  Fiat AvventuraMercedes Benz inaugurates Chandigarh's largest dealership
What is a crossover car? This is an everyday vehicle packed with the practicality and the look of a SUV on which carmakers pack off-roading elements for a more rugged look. In India we have fair number of crossovers but only a few of them can actually be called true crossovers. However, India is the country where crossovers could play a vital role as road conditions are usually not ideal and the low cost of these crossovers makes them more desirable.
These vehicles get sporty and muscular look with the application of plastic cladding at the bottom periphery, which is standard for most crossovers. Moreover, the ground clearance is raised to increase its maneuverability over choppy roads and even for off-roading. But in India that doesn’t always happen as most of them have same ground clearance as their original models.
The outside of the car is made in such a fashion that make it look more like a SUV. This includes big tyres, off road suspension and other off-road technologies – all of these bridge the gap betwen off-roaders and hatchbacks.
On the inside, the tall boy setup of crossovers gives the driver strong command of road and enhanced driveability. This nature actually make crossovers feel bigger than they actually are. Interiors may or may not feature off-road utilities like high terrain gauges or other important data-providing info.
We currently have a market that is growing everyday and have 3 cars in the crossover segment namely: VW polo Cross, Toyota Etios Cross and Fiat Avventura .
VW Polo Cross
Volkswagen back in time introduced the cross version of its popular hatchback Polo. The car is packed with premium plastic cladding to provide a sporty look. Though the cladding appeals a lot but doesn’t have any functionality as such. The reason being the car having same ground clearance as Polo which restricts its off-road use. Other than this, everything from tyres, suspension and interiors remains same as in Polo hatch. It is powered by 1.2 litre TDI diesel that puts out 74bhp@4200rpm of power and a peak torque of 180Nm@2000. But this is the same as in the original car and it has to carry more weight than before, making this upgrade pointless.
Toyota Etios Cross
Toyota Etios Cross is the car based on Toyota Etios Liva and like Polo, it too gets plastic cladding at the base that bulks it up. It has been given raised ground clearance, by 3mm, and that too because of the fatter set of tyres fitted. On the inside, the cockpit remains same as Liva and the only addition is of piano black finish on the dashboard and door panels. It is powered by 3 set of engine options borrowed from its sibling, two petrol and one diesel. On the diesel side, it gets 1.4litre engine that puts out 67.06bhp @3800rpm and a peak torque of 170Nm@1800-2400rpm. While on the petrol front it gets 1.5 litre 88.8bhp mill and a cost effective 1.2 litre motor that puts out a decent 78.9bhp. The 1.5 litre petrol is adequately powered but the ground clearance is also ready to bother on offroad trips.
Fiat Avventura
This is the only eligible contender in this category in India. The name itself means adventure and the moment you see it rolling down the street it will leave you drooling. It looks very stylish and the stepney smartly mounted on the rear hatch adds to its appearance. As it is based on one of the best looking hatchbacks (Punto) in India, it certainly appears good. Furthermore, its ground clearance is raised to 210mm and that gives it superior edge when going offroad. It is powered by 2 set of performance motors; a 1.4 litre petrol F.I.R.E. and a 1.3 litre multi jet VGT. The engines produce 88.8bhp and 91.2bhp respectively. On the inside, it gets inspiration from its younger sister Punto EVO and the Italian design is complimented by high-terrain-gauges for off-roading. Also the height of the car gives the driver great command of the road ahead.

Philae lander plants thermometer on cometA handout artist impression showing lander Philae separating from the Rosetta spacecraft and descending to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, made available by the European Space Agency (ESA) on November 12, 2014. (Source: Reuters)
By: Associated Press | Berlin | Posted: November 14, 2014 5:13 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 5:16 pm
Europe’s Philae lander is doing well and has succeeded in planting a thermometer in the comet where it touched down this week, the European Space Agency said Friday.
Scientists have received a steady stream of data from the lander, which on Wednesday became the first spacecraft to touch down on a comet and has since sent its first images from the surface of the body, known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
However, their job is complicated by the fact that Philae landed next to a cliff that is blocking sunlight from its solar panels.
Planting a thermometer in the surface was Philae’s first so-called “mechanical operation” but ESA says it will hold off on any more for now. Scientists hope to drill into the comet to extract some of the material buried beneath the surface of the comet, which is streaking through space at 41,000 mph (66,000 kph) some 311 million miles (500 million kilometers) from Earth.
The lander’s primary battery only has power for another day or so and mission controllers are contemplating how they might realign it so that the solar panels can charge the craft. An update on the mission from ESA was scheduled for later Friday.
Two harpoons that should have anchored the washing machine-sized Philae to the surface weren’t deployed during Wednesday’s landing.
That caused the lander to bounce off the comet and drift through the void for two hours before touching down again. After a second, smaller bounce, scientists believe it came to rest in a shallow crater on the comet’s 2{ mile (4-kilometer) wide body, or nucleus.
Communication with the lander is slow, with signals taking more than 28 minutes to travel between Earth and Philae’s mother ship, the Rosetta orbiter flying above the comet.

Q. This Black Friday, I'm hitting the stores. Do you have any insider knowledge about what's going to be on sale?
A. This year, laptops and TVs are going to be the hottest big-ticket items. Be sure to look for bundles that include store gift cards. Watch the terms of the gift cards closely. Some have expiration dates or other limitations. Some stores will be open Thanksgiving Day. And there are also online-only deals. Every year, companies create Black Friday ads listing their big deals. Although these are supposed to go out on Thanksgiving, they usually leak in advance.
Best Buy, Target begin teasing Black Friday deals
• Get the best prices on Amazon.com
Q. I'm starting to make Christmas shopping lists and I've noticed that prices for items on Amazon.com go up and down. How can make sure I get the lowest price?
A. CamelCamelCamel is a site that tracks Amazon prices with an interesting twist. You can add items to your shopping list and the site will notify you when the price drops. You can also see a price trend graph that shows the general price range of the item over time.  But did you know you can also get availability alerts, text shipment alerts, and share your Prime account with family members so they also get free shipping?
• Spotty Wi-Fi fixes
Q. I can stream Netflix to my laptop no problem in my living room. But in my bedroom on the other side of the house, it slows to a crawl. Do you know what's going on?
A. It's likely that your router isn't strong enough to send a good signal to your bedroom. In that case, get a Wi-Fi extender and put it in the middle of your home. You might also have a neighbor near that side of the house whose Wi-Fi network is conflicting with yours. To easily find out, grab a free program like Vistumbler . It gives you full details on every Wi-Fi network in range - including signal strength and channel.
• Speed up a slow smartphone
Q. My smartphone is slowing down, which might be because the storage space is almost full. Do you think that's it? How do I fix it?
A. Like any computer, a smartphone is just going to slow down over time as it gets filled with more information. Try removing any apps you no longer need to free up space. In Android, this is done under Settings>>Apps or App Manager. Tap an app and then tap, "Uninstall." For iPhone, tap and hold an app icon on the home screen until it wobbles, then hit the "X" to delete the app. Of course, there's still hidden stuff on your gadget that can also take up space. Click here for step-by-step details on how to clear your phone's cache, search history, call logs & more.

Retail sales rose 0.3% in October, rebounding from a a 0.3% drop in September, as falling gasoline prices helped boost discretionary cash for consumers. That beat estimates for a rise of 0.2%, according to Actions Economics.

Himachal Pradesh targets Rs 2 500 cr worth investment proposals  single-window meetingsoonPrint
Written by Ashwani Sharma | Shimla | Posted: November 14, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 8:32 pm
Himachal Pradesh is all set to get investment proposals of whopping Rs 2,500 cr  from half a dozen industrial giants in the textile, distilleries, pharmaceutical and automobile sectors before end of the year .
The response, which is quite an initial,is result of Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh and his high level team’s visit to Mumbai, Bangalore and Ahmedabad last week to woo industrial investors and hardsell state’s potential as an acknowledged  investment destination in the north India.
The proposals include Rs 550 cr expansion of existing unit of Vardhman Textiles group, Rs 350 crore from M/s Indorama textile, Rs 300 cr from M/s Macleods Pharmaceutical, Rs 300 cr from Torrent group and Rs 150 crore from Rock-Star distilleries. There is also a proposal M/s L-R distilleries to invest Rs 250 crores .
Industries Minister Mukesh Agnihotri, who was a co-host with Chief Minister, during the one-on-one interactions with leading industrial investors said, “I propose to write personal letters to 100 investors, who  participated in the investment meets at three place. I am asking them to sent their proposals fast. The industries department will clear new proposals in seven days and revenue department will also grant necessary approvals in 15 days time”.
Apart from investments in the industrial sectors, the investors showed keen interest in agro-processing, tourism, infrastructure projects like ropeways and hotels, education and few unexplored sectors like handicrafts based industry.
The investors like TATA group had discussions on projects ranging from setting-up of IT park to solar energy project and aerial ropeways like one Palchan to Rohtang, beside Bijli Mahadeo. The tourism department had already invited expression of interests for six projects and all investors including TATA has been told to submit their projects to the tourism department separately.
“When next meeting of the HP state single window  clearance authority (headed by Chief Minister) is convened, we have a target to approve new investments worth Rs 2500 crores”, said Agnihotri.
Another mega investment conclave is proposed for Delhi –where Himachal Pradesh will position itself as major stakeholder in country’s ‘Make-in-India’ drive. The state will  ask the industralists manufacturing their products in Himachal to write ‘ Made in Himachal’.
Industries Minister said “biggest advantage which Himachal Pradesh enjoys is its surplus power. Our power tariff  is lowest and power will be provided 24X7 with zero cut. More than 1000 MW of additional power will be added to existing availability from hydro-projects  and rates will further come down. There will be a five-year traffic freeze too”.
Himachal Pradesh till now been lacking in woo automobile bigwiz but after this months investment meets TVs group has agreed to upscale its manufacturing unit facility to roll-out its Himachal-make bikes.
Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh, in the next phase, is expected to travel to Hyderabad and Ludhiana (Punjab) to lure industrialists. “Till now, no one figured out small hill state’s potential in the industrial sector. After Chief Minister’s visit, Himachal Pradesh will also be a player for new investments in the country”, says Agnihotri.

We have appealed to all sections of people to leave separatism:BJPPrint
By: Express News Service | Jammu | Posted: November 14, 2014 8:24 pm
The Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday declined to have any truck with separatists during or post 2014 assembly elections.
Replying to a question on former separatist leader Sajjad Lone’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, senior BJP leader Ram Madhav here said that “we have appealed to all sections of people to leave separatism and join the mainstream and our doors are open for you”. “Anyone who shuns separatism and joins the mainstream…stands up to contest election against corrupt parties led by two families and expresses willingness to work for strengthening Narendra Modi in carrying forward Kashmir on the path of development, we are ready to work with them,” he said.
Pointing out that “it is better to come to the doors of the Indian Prime Minister than to be at the doors of Pakistan High Commission”, he said that BJP was not contesting the 2014 elections like previous ones, but to form its own government this time so as to take the state to the path of development. He emphasized the need to bring an end to the dynasty rule of one or the other family and bring a government which truly represents the people of the state.
He referred to both the National Conference and PDP as “Baap-Beta” (father-son) and “Baap-Beti” (father-daughter) parties.

Black Friday doesn't have the best deals

The monikers Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become linguistic pawns in the retail discount game as stores take "doorbusters" digital and dangle "Black Friday" sales in front of customers weeks before the actual event.
Now, Thanksgiving is officially better than Black Friday when it comes to getting deals, according to a report from Adobe Systems. But shoppers don't even have to wait until then to take home hot products at the cheapest prices.
Black Friday is "more of an idea than a single-day event anymore," says Calvin Silva, lead retail analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services.
Enter the pre-Black Friday sale. In the never-ending race to stay ahead of the competition, retailers are rolling out deeper discounts earlier. Target, Walmart, Amazon, Kohl's, Toys R Us, Sears and Staples are all planning pre-Black Friday sales, some of which have already started.
More retailers offering last-minute Christmas delivery
Online prices will hit their lowest point on Thanksgiving, with an average discount of 24%, according to Adobe. That beats any other day of the holiday season. Prices will still be an average of 20% off the week leading up to Thanksgiving, and online and in-store prices are generally expected to match, other than with store-specific Black Friday promotions, Adobe says. As online and mobile shopping grows in popularity every year, retailers are trying to compete with the fact that customers can access goods online anytime they want, says Jon Lal, CEO of coupon site BeFrugal.com. Walmart is calling its campaign the "new Black Friday."
"Black Friday is no longer about waking up at the crack of dawn to stand in long lines and hope for the best," Walmart's Chief Merchandising Officer Duncan Mac Naughton said about the company's holiday plans. In a call with media he added, "I think you're going to see chapters of activity throughout the month."
Retailers say they're responding to customer demand, though deal experts say the earlier sales are just as much, if not more, of a strategic decision.
"It's not necessarily consumers (who) want to get out there and shop earlier," says Loren Bendele, president of discount website Savings.com. "It's just retailers trying to get those sales sooner and therefore stealing from their competition. If you're going to buy a big-screen TV, you're only going to buy one, so whoever gets it first wins."
Dates you need to know for holiday shopping
A Savings.com analysis of deals from the past five years, released this week, found that the number of deals available from retailers peak the week before Thanksgiving. Although the best time to buy depends on what you're looking for, Bendele says. The Savings.com data found that the best day to buy toys is the day before Thanksgiving, while your best bet for electronics is the very beginning of November. The website also found that holiday deals advertised as early as October more than doubled between 2009 and 2013.

Consumers who have started shopping say they're already finding attractive deals. Michele Polanski, a 33 year-old from Fort Worth, says she saw Black Friday-like prices at Gap in the past week while shopping for clothes for her family's holiday picture. She says the experience has made her less likely to want to shop on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.
"Not everybody has the desire to go out on Black Friday because it's a zoo," Polanski says. "I feel like the retailers are making it easier to get the same kind of deals but not have to endure that."
But you can't completely disregard the magnitude of deals on Black Friday, says Brian Hoyt, spokesperson for deal website RetailMeNot, though he concedes Black Friday no longer stands out as much as it once did. The average savings on Black Friday last year was 37%, the same as on Thanksgiving and the following Saturday, according an analysis of offers on RetailMeNot.
"The reality is that the five days of savings from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday are still the most active, deepest discounts and most savings consumers experience throughout the year," he says.
This year Black Friday will be about showcasing deals on specific items like HD TVs and gaming systems, where shoppers care more about price than about where they buy the product, Silva says. Consumers looking for new clothes should start shopping now, though, while apparel retailers are already pushing steep discounts, he says. With the rise in online and mobile shopping, Black Friday has become less important as a day for blowout sales.
"Retailers are understanding that they've also got other channels that they can leverage," Silva says. "They don't really need to count on all of the volume being moved on that day."

Surendranagar infant deaths: One more child admitted tohospitalPrint
By: Express News Service | Rajkot | Posted: November 14, 2014 8:38 pm
A day after two infants died within hours of getting BCG and polio vaccines in Dharai village of Chotila town in Surendranagar district, one more infant was admitted to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital on Friday after doctors concluded that she had “congenital complications.” On the other hand, police have started recording statements of parents of children who were administered vaccine of polio and BCG at the aganwadi centre in the village on Wednesday.
“After the deaths of two infants, a team of experts from Sola Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad and state health department visited Dharai village and checked all the 15 infants who had been administered vaccine. The pediatrician concluded that one the girl child had congenital complications and recommended admission. So, she has been admitted to Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad. However, this admission has nothing to do with her getting polio vaccine,” chief district medical officer (CDHO) of Surendrangar, Dr Shivnath Dev told The Indian Express.
The 25-day-old baby girl who has been admitted in the hospital was identified as Roshan Bhupat Jada, a resident of Dharai. The infant had been given polio drops by health workers in Dharai village on Wednesday.
“Medical officer of Chotila told us Thursday afternoon that Roshan will have to be taken to Ahmedabad for treatment. They sent a car to our village at around 4 am and took the girl to Ahmedabad. The girl has been kept in incubator and doctors are telling that her cardiac function is normal and that they were waiting for her blood reports,” Vinu Jada, uncle to the father of the girl child, told over phone from Ahmedabad.
Incidentally, 45-day-old twins, Nikul and Nirav of Dharai village had died early on Thursday, hours after receiving shots of BCG and polio the previous day. Their father Bhala Nangani had alleged that the vaccine doses led to death of their sons. Chotila police had registered a case of accidental deaths in this regard.
Meanwhile, police started investigation of the case and recorded statements of parents of the children who were administered vaccine in Dharai and Dhokalva villages. “The female health worker who administered the shots has told in her statement that she had given the regular quantity of vaccines to the twins. We have also been told that health officers of Surendranagar have taken away vials of vaccines, from which doses were administered, for their own inquiry,” Chotila police sub-inspector Pratapsinh Gohil said.
The PSI further said that they were expecting primary report of post mortem of the twin baby boys in next two days. Forensic experts of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Medical College in Rajkot had conducted post-mortem on the boys on Thursday.

Fresh guidelines to supersede UPA s policy: Centre to SC on gas pricinggas pricing
(Government has issued new…)
NEW DELHI: The NDA government today told the Supreme Court that the fresh guidelines framed by it would "supersede" previous UPA dispensation's policy on price fixation for natural gas, including that from Krishna-Godavari basin, which has been the bone of contention between the Centre and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
"Government has issued new guidelines. It is not going by the formula for gas pricing recommended by C Rangarajan Committee and the new guidelines would supersede the earlier guidelines," Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar submitted before a bench headed by Justice T S Thakur.
The Centre's response was to the question raised by the court on September 18 asking it to make its stand clear on fixation of the price for gas from Krishna-Godavari basin as to whether it sticks to the previous UPA dispensation's policy or making any departure from it.
The Solictor General said 'new domestic natural gas policy' was approved by the government on October 18 raising natural gas price to USD 5.61 per mmBtu from November 1 and "recommendation of the Rangarajan Committee would not be given effect".
The Rangarajan formula on gas pricing was approved by the previous UPA government. Rangarajan was Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the then Prime Minister.
The Solicitor General said he will place before the bench the submissions to butress why the new guidelines are better than the earlier recommended.
The bench was hearing the PILs filed in 2013 by senior CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta and the NGO, Common Cause, challenging the UPA government decision to double the price of natural gas from 4.2 US dollar to 8.4 dollar per mmbtu and seeking cancellation of Reliance Industries Ltd's contract for exploration of oil and gas from the KG basin.
The third PIL on the issue has been filed by advocate M L Sharma.
Responding to the bench's query, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for RIL, said "he is not happy with the new guidelines".
He also submitted that the court should hear the matter after the proceeding before an arbitral tribunal on the dispute of gas pricing between RIL and Centre is decided.
While the Centre maintained that the issue raised by Dasgupta has been addressed with the new guidelines, advocate Prashant Bhushan said several other issues raised by him in the NGO's petition needs to be argued and also claimed that a draft CAG report suggested that RIL "hugely over-estimated" the reserves of the KG gas block and other irregularities are cited.

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued a Rs 660 crore showcause notice to consumer electronics major Videocon Group on charges of violation of foreign exchange laws.
The notice, under provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), has been issued by the Mumbai office of the agency after its probe found that the group has "contravened" the law as it failed to comply with RBI norms by not declaring funds generated by some wholly owned subsidiaries the group had raised overseas few years back, according to ED sources.
"The group has been charged under section 6 (3) of FEMA which talks about transfer or issue of any foreign security by a person resident in India. The show cause notice has said that the violation done by the group is worth Rs 660 crore," they said.
When contacted, Videocon Group Chairman Venugopal Dhoot told PTI that they have "not yet received any notice in this regard so far."
He, however, said the matter could be related to "non-submission of quarterly returns and there would be no monetary penalty to the company. Also, FEMA violation is not a criminal offence."
Sources said the group raised loans worth USD 100 million abroad and subsequently invested these funds into the Indian arm of the company, allegedly in violation of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and FEMA guidelines.
The agency has been probing the case since 2011-12 and it has now asked the group to reply to the notice within a month following which the charges will be adjudicated.
The Mumbai-based diversified Videocon group has interests in consumer durables, DTH services, oil and gas and real estate.

Will resign as minister  MP if proved guilty:KatheriaPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:03 pm
Under attack for allegedly forging his graduation marksheet, Union Minister of State for HRD Ram Shankar Katheria on Friday offered to resign if proved guilty even as Opposition parties stepped up their tirade against him.
Congress and BSP attacked him over the controversy while BJP defended him saying he is a victim of “political vendetta” and the matter dates back to the BSP government in Uttar Pradesh.
“I can say if it is proved that there is any forgery in my marksheet, not only will I resign from the post of minister but also as an MP,” he said.
A case was filed in 2010 against Katheria in Allahabad High Court by his rival BSP candidate charging him with forging his marksheet. The court has, however, referred the matter to the sessions court in Agra, which will hear it on November 26.
Congress mocked at and targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the row involving the minister saying the “master” does not seem to be in control.
Linking the issue to an earlier controversy about HRD Minister Smriti Irani’s educational qualifications, Congress spokesperson Salman Khurshid sarcastically said, “There is something called a talent pool and one picks people for a particular job, the best suited candidate is chosen. In this case, it seems those who have maximum human resources have been picked for the job.”
Asked if it amounted to a criminal offence, Khurshid said, “If he (Modi) listens to me, I should certainly demand but I have a sinking feeling that he will not listen.” He also demanded an answer from the Prime Minister on the issue.
Party general secretary Digvijay Singh tweeted, “First Minister HRD and now MOS HRD has given Fraud Mark Sheet! On top of it RSS wants to change the Text Books and Indian History”.
Another Congress leader Ajay Maken tweeted, “BJP-Gift to the Nation Education Min filed wrong Affidavit: MOS allegedly forged MarkSheet! Modi’s #Clean Politics?”.
BSP leader Sudhindra Bhadoria said, “Prime Minister is running a campaign on cleanliness. I urge him to run a cleanliness drive in his government as well. That will send the right message in the country. If there is dirt in the government and outside there is a cleanliness campaign then people will think it is a fake campaign.”
Defending Katheria, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “All these cases are nothing but political vendetta. The case had been started by the BSP government. The BSP government could not find anything in the enquiry and as a result no FIR was filed.”
Congress leader Rashid Alvi said if any person has fake certificate, then it is a criminal offence.
But if HRD minister keeps a fake certificate, then what will happen to this country’s education, what will happen to the students who are studying various schools and universities, he asked.
“Perhaps the Prime Minister is making such people ministers and if this continues, then this system will collapse,” he said.
Katheria is at the centre of a controversy over an allegation that his graduation marksheet was forged.

Islamic State leader orders terror group to mint its owncoinsPrint
By: AP | Cairo | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:01 pm
The leader of the Islamic State group has ordered the terror organisation to start minting gold, silver and copper coins for its own currency the Islamic dinar.
A website affiliated with the group posted the order late on Thursday, saying IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi instructed his followers to mint the coins to “change the tyrannical monetary system” modelled on Western economies that “enslaved Muslims.”
The order was approved by the Islamic State group’s Shura Council, an advisory board, according to the website. The authenticity of the posting could not be independently verified but the website has been used in the past for IS postings.
After seizing large swaths of Iraqi and Syrian territory earlier this year, the Islamic State group proclaimed a caliphate on lands under its control. It has also sought to implement its harsh interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, and al-Baghdadi has proclaimed himself the caliph.
According to photographs of coin prototypes, they carry the words in Arabic: “The Islamic State / A Caliphate Based on the Doctrine of the Prophet.”
It’s unclear where the Islamic State group intends to get the gold, silver and copper for the coins. It said the dinar’s purchasing power would be its weight in gold, silver or copper.
One of the gold coins carries the symbol of seven stalks of wheat, mentioned in the Quran, while another has the map of the world, a reference to Islam someday ruling the entire world.
One of the silver coins shows a sword and a shield in a reference to holy war, or jihad while another has a minaret symbolising Damascus mentioned in one of the Prophet Muhammad’s sayings.
Another coin carries the symbol of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, where the Prophet prayed. It’s revered as Islam’s third-holiest place, complete with the site’s iconic gold-topped Dome of the Rock, which enshrines the rock from which Muslims believe the Prophet ascended to heaven.
The copper coins carry the symbol of the crescent moon and three palm trees, also significant in Islam.
The posting said instructions from the Islamic State’s treasury department would be forthcoming, explaining to the people how to use the currency.

NEW DELHI: The draw of lots for DDA's flagship 'Housing Scheme 2014', offering over 25,000 flats across various categories, will be held on Monday to decide the fate of over 10 lakh applicants.
The draw would be held DDA headquarters 'Vikas Sadan' at 11:30 AM and officials said the date has been decided after conducting a series of successful dry runs.
"The draw of lots for the 'DDA Housing Scheme 2014' would be held on November 17 at 11:30 AM. The date was decided after conducting a series of dry runs to check our preparedness for the same," a senior DDA official told PTI.
DDA for the first time would also be "webcasting live" the entire draw on the Internet with a dedicated URL for the same.
"We have created a dedicated website for the draw, and instead of directly webcasting through a YouTube channel, we later decided to create a separate window for the event altogether, where online user can see the proceedings live," DDA's Director (Systems) V S Tomar said.
He said online users must visit this site directly as no link has been provided through the official DDA website, to preclude any chance of crashing of the home site.
The first dry run was held by the housing authority on November 10.
C-DAC ( Centre for Development of Advanced Computing ), which had conducted the draw for DDA's last housing scheme in 2010, has been roped in this time again for the event.
The new scheme, which offers over 25,000 flats across various categories, ranging in price from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore, closed on October 15.
It offers 25,034 flats, viz. - EWS, LIG, MIG, HIG, Janta flats and one-room apartments. The 22,627 one-bed room apartments were a major draw for the people this year.
The senior official said all application are available online for applicants to check their status.

The FIPB on Friday cleared the long-pending proposal of HDFC Bank to hike foreign holding in the bank to 74 per cent.
“FIPB today considered and approved HDFC Bank’s proposal to raise foreign investment ceiling to 74 per cent,” officials said after the meeting of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.
The FIPB is of the view that HDFC Bank’ parent HDFC Ltd’s 22 per cent holding in the bank is FDI and hence total foreign holding is 73.39 per cent, which includes FII, FDI, ADR and GDR.
“So the bank has little headroom to raise funds from foreign investors,” the official said.
Late last year, HDFC Bank had approached the FIPB for increasing the foreign holding in the bank to 67.55 per cent from 49 per cent.
However, the proposal was not cleared by the FIPB as the Finance and Industry ministry was of the view that the parent HDFC Ltd’s 22 per cent holding in the bank is FDI.
Taking into consideration the 22 per cent parent holding as FDI, the total foreign holding was more than 67.55 per cent when they approached the FIPB for the first time.
Following clarification sought by FIPB earlier this year HDFC Bank sent a revised proposal raising its foreign holding ceiling request to 74 per cent, from its earlier proposal of 67.55 per cent.
Further, the proposal of pharma company Sanofi was cleared by FIPB in Friday’s meeting along with Punj Llyod’s proposal to enter into defence space.

The Indian operations of leading automobile manufacturer Tata Motors continued to weigh down the company which reported a drop of 7.1 per cent in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September 2014 at Rs 3,291 crore. Consolidated revenues rose 6.5 per cent to Rs 56,867 crore owing to a good showing by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). The operating margin was up 60 basis points at 15.8 per cent.
C. Ramakrishnan, CFO, Tata Motors said two factors impacted JLR. "Higher tax provisioning and more importantly, with the new launches, higher depreciation and amortization while in India, some tax reversals of credits impacted the profitability."
Indian operations report loss
Tata Motors’ India operations reported a loss of Rs 1,845.63 crore (loss of 803.53 crore) on total income of Rs 8,750 crore (Rs 8,868.4 crore). Operating margin was negative 1.7 per cent (2 per cent) with tax was at Rs 738.2 crore (credit of Rs 180 crore).
"There was a sharp reversal in performance over the last 10 quarters with the medium & heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) sales growing 14.1 per cent due to firm freight rates and replacement demand," Ravi Pisharody, ED, CV Business, Tata Motors told a press conference. Subdued infrastructure activity and high interest rate regime impacted the quarter performance.
"The small CV segment continues to be hit by constrained financing but will pick up next year," he said. The company expects the Bolt car to be launched in the current quarter and Safari Storm facelift to drive growth.
JLR’s strong performance
An increase in wholesale volume and richer product mix saw JLR report a net profit of 450 million pounds (507 million pounds) for the September quarter on 4.2 per cent higher revenues of 4.808 billion pounds. Kenneth Gregor, CFO, JLR said the bottomline was impacted by unfavorable revaluation of foreign current debt, unrealized hedges, higher depreciation and amortization. Wholesale sales rose 2 per cent to 103,000 units while retail sales were up 8 per cent at 110,000 units. Operating profit rose 15.3 per cent at 933 million pounds and operating margin was was 19.4 per cent (17.5 per cent).

He said the plan was to expand the global footprint and JLR would start production at its Brazilian facility in 2016.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange, Tata Motors fell 0.47 per cent to close trade at Rs 523.8.

Kunal suicide: Minister likely to losejobPrint
Written by Sabyasachi Bandopadhyay | Kolkata | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:03 pm
The suicide attempt by Kunal Ghosh took its toll on the job of minister for jails Hyder Aziz Safi as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has on Friday expressed her profound dissatisfaction over the performance of the department at a review meeting of her cabinet colleagues’ performance in the state assembly.
While Safi, a former IPS officer is all likely to lose his job, two other ministers, minister for hirticulture Krishnendu Narayan Choudhury and minister without portfolio Sabitri Mitra have been warned. And while Choudhury was criticised for the performance of his department, Mitra apparently invited the wrath of the chief minister for allegedly indulging in factionalism at Malda district Trinamool Congress of which she is the president. Incidentally Choudhury is also from Malda and the two are sworn enemies of each other.
At the meeting which was attended by other senior ministers of her cabinet Mamata gave her senior colleague  Subrata Mukherjee the job of monitoring the performance of other ministers.
She also asked the MLAs of her party to raise their performance level in the assembly by keeping themselves posted with latest developments in every field, and being alert all the time so that they could not be taken off guard by the opposition at any moment.

Delhi govt relaxes norms on leasehold proper...Delhi government relaxes norm on purchase, sale of leasehold properties

(The Revenue department…)
NEW DELHI: In a major relief, the Delhi government has lifted restriction on sale of leasehold properties which will benefit lakhs of property owners and may trigger hike in real estate prices.
The Revenue department has asked all registrar offices to allow purchase and sale of leasehold properties and the decision came into effect from today.
Though, there were restrictions, transactions had been taking place through general power of attorney.
Officials said properties that have changed hands but were registered through power of attorney or sale agreement will be allowed for sale and purchase transactions.
The Revenue Department had forbidden purchase and sale of leasehold properties in 2011.
"It is clarified to all Sub-Registrar that under Section 17 (1-A) of the Registration Act, the documents containing contract to transfer for consideration any immovable property is compulsorily registrable document if having been executed after the commencement of Registration (Amendment) Act 2001, (w.e.f. 24.09.2001).
"An agreement to sell in respect of immovable property is covered under section 17 (1-A) of the Registration Act and is a valid document to be registered if so desired by the parties and as such all these documents cannot be refused by Sub-Registrar," the circular said.
The decision is likely to benefit lakhs of property owners in the national capital as they will be able to sell their properties.
The government decision, experts said, may fuel hike in property prices.
The property owners had been demanding relaxation in the norm for many years and now the decision will benefit areas such as Rohini, Vasant Kunj, Dwarka, Janakpuri.
The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) owns such leasehold properties and the restriction had been imposed after commercial activities were reported in some of the colonies owned by the agency.
DDA officials said the decision will help owners of leasehold properties in a major way.

Why is Nehru so important for a faceless IndianBe critical of Nehru's policies, not his persona
Nivedita Mishra , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 14, 2014
First Published: 20:45 IST(14/11/2014) | Last Updated: 14:48 IST(17/11/2014)
Comments
I must have been in my early teens when my dad gave me Glimpses of World History. At our home, history and literature have been of abiding interests. So, the possibility of getting a ringside view of world history told in the most engaging manner was a wondrous idea. Years later, when I was much older, possibly in early 20s, I read his Discovery of India and his autobiography. My dad also maintained a diary of his favourite quotes and writings from the world of letters. In them, I discovered Nehru’s Tryst with Destiny and Will and Testament writings.
Slowly but surely, an image of the man emerged – a man gifted with language, a passionate nationalist, a modernist beyond compare, a world citizen, a scholar, a man of excellent Kashmiri pandit ancestry... and a strikingly good-looking man.
Later when I joined journalism, I would devour whatever was being written about Nehru. In an editorial by columnist Bramha Chellaney, for instance, in 2007, I was to get a reading of what happened in 1962, what led to it and how it affected Nehru. I recall reading how Nehru could never really get over the fact that the China, despite agreeing to the principle of panchsheela, would so brazenly disregard it and attack India.
It is generally believed that Nehru died of heart attack or possibly failure. Chellaney almost suggested that the Chinese behaviour could have been the lasting reason.
During those years, a colleague would turn from being a Nehru champion to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose hunter, and therefore a Nehru baiter. We at Hindustantimes.com did a special microsite on the disappearance of Netaji (2003-04). The series of articles, among other things, hinted that Netaji did not die in 1945 and that Nehru effectively blocked his entry back to India. Why? Apparently because of his lust for power.
Why would the son of a rich man leave the comforts of his wealthy home, toil for India’s independence like many others, go to jail for many, many years and do such a petty thing? Thank god, Indians don’t buy this. But you never know...
Much later when internet became part of daily lives, I would often see YouTube videos vilifying Nehru by, sometimes, picking known facts and twisting in a biased logic and sometimes peddling pure falsehood.
I could have easily said that this was the handiwork of a fringe lunatic group, but when I see the YouTube views these videos get, I cringe in disbelief wondering how gullible people can be. You scream from the rooftops all kinds of falsehoods and half-truths that people begin believing in after while. You start worrying when such videos get somewhere 2 or 3 lakh views (with some even hovering in the vicinity of 22 lakhs, goodness!).
As an independent 40-year-old financially stable woman, I have lot to thank a guy like Nehru for. The social security, I enjoy today for instance.
If I have the right to my father’s property, something unimaginable 70 years ago, I am absolutely indebted to a man like him.
He’s the guy who put his weight behind women’s education. Needless to say, countries that have educated their daughters have generally developed fast.
It is extremely scary when cousins and friends hold forth on half-baked ideas, and sometimes even falsehoods, over dinner table conversations or drawing room discussions.
I cringe everytime people want you to believe that Nehru surrendered Kashmir at the behest of Edwina Mountbatten. Really? Can the destiny of a nation of some 80 million people be decided under the stupor of alleged romantic dalliances or in bedrooms? Could it be, Edwina and her husband influenced his decision in taking the matter to the UN but... there can never be any justification for making such sweeping statements so casually.
It is easy rubbish all this as utter nonsense, but isn’t it is worrying when such beliefs take centrestage? Aren’t these people also Indian voters?
Haven’t you been bombarded with or tagged with nonsensical Facebook posts? I have seen posts suggesting that Nehru died of STDs. Really? Some others say Nehru was a Muslim. We thought his ancestor Raj Kaul, a well-known Sanskrit and Persian scholar, who moved from Kashmir valley to the plains in search for fame and fortune in the dying years on Mughal era. Wow, who are these story tellers who weave such tales?
Surely Nehru made mistakes, some grievous ones at that in his lifetime and his political descendants have done more harm to his legacy than his detractors ever can. But must we judge a man on the basis of half truths?
There has to be something terribly wrong in us as a nation if one half indulges in unabashed hero worshipping while the other goes all out to make a villain out of him.
Surely, we can do better.

G-20 leaders to tackle corruption atsummitThe B-20 meeting engages governments on behalf of the international business community. Leaders of the top 20 industrialized nations will gather in Brisbane November 15-16 for their annual G20 summit. (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Brisbane | Posted: November 14, 2014 9:47 pm
Corruption is a perennial topic for the G-20, with leaders dubbing it a threat to global growth, and activists arguing it hurts the poorest countries the most by siphoning away desperately needed money that could be used to improve health systems, schools and roads.
Washington, DC-based advocacy group ONE has urged leaders to make the issue a top priority at this weekend’s summit in Brisbane after recently releasing a report that estimates money laundering, bribery and tax evasion cost the developing world more than USD 1 trillion a year.
The group also estimates that as many as 3.6 million deaths could be prevented if money drained from the poorest countries by corruption was invested in health systems.
Anti-corruption group Transparency International, Amnesty International and other human rights groups have urged G-20 leaders to deliver concrete results at the summit, calling in particular for a crackdown on the use of shell companies that hide the true owners of businesses.
Anti-corruption advocates want public registries created that would show who actually owns and benefits from companies. Since 2010, the G-20 has issued two-year action plans on anti-corruption efforts, and a report on what has been achieved under the last plan is expected at this weekend’s summit.
The leaders will also issue a new plan for 2015-16, which is expected to include commitments on issues such as foreign bribery, stolen asset recovery and whistleblower protection, said A J Brown, a director with Transparency International Australia.

Following heavy rains upstream Pulichintala project in Prakasam district, the project received heavy inflows from local streams in Nalgonda district since Wednesday evening, resulting in increase of water storage to 13 tmcft.
Adlur, Vellatur, Chintriyala, Shobanadrigudem are cut off from the rest of the world. At Adlur, water entered at least a dozen houses.
Crops were also submerged in the back waters of the project. At least four villages of Guntur district have lost access. Following complaints from residents, the irrigation authorities lifted one crest gate and released 7,800 cusecs down stream Prakasam barrage on Friday afternoon.
Superintendent Engineer at Pulichintla, S. Chandrasekhar Rao, said the reservoir has 12.5 tmcft water now. However, he said that they are still receiving some inflows.
“We are closely monitoring the inflows, we will let more water downstream and keep water storage to 12 tmcft to avoid submergence of villages and crops,” he informed.

Petrol  Diesel Excise Duty Hiked: How it Impacts YouRBI to Ease Rates by 0.5 Per Cent in 2015, First Cut Likely in February: Morgan Stanley
The government on Thursday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel. While unbranded petrol excise duty has been hiked to Rs 2.70/litre from Rs 1.20/litre, the duty on unbranded diesel has been raised to Rs 2.96/litre from Rs 1.46/litre.
However, the excise duty hike is unlikely to affect fuel prices for consumers. Oil companies are likely to cut petrol and diesel prices this Saturday due to sliding global prices.
But the quantum of the price cut may be lower due to the excise duty hike. Those expecting further relief in prices, may be in for disappointment, as the excise duty hike may offset the likely reduction in prices.There is a possibility that cut may be put off altogether, as well.
The government's move to hike excise duty is aimed at getting higher revenues in its coffers.
If prices are cut this Saturday, it would be the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August and the third in rates of diesel since its decontrol last month.
Diesel price was for the first time in more than five years cut on October 19, by Rs 3.37 a litre, when the government decided to deregulated the fuel. This was followed by another cut on November 1.
Prior to the October 19 reduction, diesel rates were last cut in January 2009.
Following their fortnightly review practice, state-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) are due to revise rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday.

Rahul Gandhi will visit Pendari village in Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh on Saturday, where botched sterilisation surgeries have left 13 women dead.
Sources said that Gandhi will be meeting the family members of the victims and also take stock of the corrective measures being taken by the state government.
The Chhattisgarh government has constituted a probe panel under a retired judge to investigate the botched surgeries at Bilaspur’s government-run medical camps which have so far left 13 young women dead while nearly 138 others have been taken ill.
Congress has demanded the resignation of the state’s health minister over the affair.
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh on Thursday announced the setting up of a “transparent and unbiased” judicial probe into the tragedy while accusing Congress of trying to politicise the issue.
The terms of reference of the probe include ascertaining the quality of medicines and equipment used and whether the standard protocol for performance of such surgeries was followed for the sterilisation procedure. It will also fix accountability and recommend measures to prevent recurrence of such incidents.

Vaidehi’s drawing that was carried on the Google homepage on Friday depicted the one-horned rhino, tiger, bihu, the traditional jaapi as well as tea and bamboo grooves, all giving a huge boost to Assam’s tourism prospects throughout the day.
Assam chief minister Gogoi, extending an invitation to Vaidehi and her family to Assam, said, “I extend invitation to Vaidehi and her family to visit Assam,” Gogoi said in a statement on Friday. Vaidehi’s sketch was selected through record breaking entries of over one million, from more than 1700 schools across 50 Indian cities.

Nasdaq investors are counting the ticks until they can join the new high party other major indexes are celebrating. The day is getting near thanks to a number of stocks pulling the weight.
The Nasdaq itself might still be more than 7% below its 2000 high, but the index is still at its highest level since March, 28, 2000. Why? So far, 727 of the 1,233 Nasdaq composite stocks that were trading in the index back then — and still trade today — are actually already higher, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Here’s the part that will surprise you even more: Most of the biggest winners aren’t tech stocks.
Driving the Nasdaq higher aren’t the familiar names of the tech boom — but instead a cadre of almost everything but. Just eight stocks in the Nasdaq 100, including energy drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) , single-cup coffee company Keurig Green Mountain (GRMR) and agricultural retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) are up 2,000% or more from where they were on March 10, 2000 — when the Nasdaq peaked.
These stocks are especially meaningful since they’re the leaders of the current Nasdaq 100, which are the 100 most valuable non-financial stocks in the Nasdaq. They’re also the stocks that largely drive the index’ value.
The contribution of these winning stocks is essential to pull the Nasdaq back to the level some investors thought they’d never seen again in their lifetime. The Nasdaq itself is still 7.3% below its all-time high of 5,048.62 set when the dot-com bubble was in full swing in March 2000. It’s been 14 years to get back. But it gets closer just about every week. The Nasdaq Friday is trading at around 4,670.
Making money from this magnificent comeback took a good dose of contrarian though. Remember that everything high-tech was the rage back in 2000. But investors who went low-tech – and invested in winning beverage makers – are the kings of the Nasdaq now.
Monster Beverage has been the biggest winner in the Nasdaq since the last time it peaked, perhaps metaphorically appropriate as it’s given the market a much needed boost when it was low on energy. Back in 2000, Monster had a much tamer name, Hansen’s Natural, and specialized in making natural juices. Shares of the company were trading for about 27 cents back then on a split-adjusted basis, says S&P Capital IQ. But when the energy drink craze landed, Monster turned into a monster. Shares have exploded 40,618% to $108.16.
Interestingly, another beverage company was the second top winner. Keurig Green Mountain was just a sleepy maker of coffee back in 2000. It was called Green Mountain Coffee Roasters with shares trading for about 40 cents back in March 2000. But everything changed after the company bought single-cup coffee brewer Keurig in 2006. Before long, revenue was soaring and the company had a partnership with Starbucks (SBUX) and Coca-Cola (KO) was an investor. Investors who bought in in 2000? They’re up 38,556%.
To be fair, there is one critical tech stock that’s helped power the Nasdaq higher, big time: Apple. Back in 2000, the company was little more than a has-been maker of PCs. But the maker of electronic gadgets first found success selling an MP3 player — but then the iPhone happened and now Apple is the most valuable U.S. company. The stock is up 2,412% since March 2000.
But if there’s a lesson in all this, it’s that serious money is to be made any time – even when the market is topping. The key is investing in growth companies that others are overlooking.

Sonia  Rahul Gandhi adopt villages under Narendra ModisschemePrint
By: PTI | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 10:24 pm
Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi have adopted one village each in their respective constituencies to develop them into model villages under “Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana” launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month.
Party sources said that while Sonia Gandhi has selected village Udwa from Jagatpur block in her Parliamentary seat Raebareli, Rahul has chosen village ‘Deeh’ in Jagdishpur block in Amethi constituency, an area industrialised during his father late Rajiv Gandhi’s Prime Ministerial tenure.
Udwa in Jagatpur is also the birthplace of Rana Beni Madhav and has a rich historical background. Party sources, however, said that adopting the villages does not mean endorsing the scheme launched by Modi. Modi had launched Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana on the
occasion of birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan last month as was promised in his maiden Independence Day speech.
Launching the scheme, Modi had said that if nearly 800 MPs develop three village each by 2019, around 2,500 villages will be covered in the country and the initiative will change the face of the country by chain reaction.
The Centre had recently extended the deadline by one more week for adopting villages under the plan. The Prime Minister himself has adopted Jayapur village in his Parliamentary constituency Varanasi.

Ebola wiping out Sierra Leones post-war gains:StudyEbola-hit Sierra Leone faces social and economic disaster as gains made since the country's ruinous civil war are wiped out by the epidemic.

Ebola-hit Sierra Leone faces social and economic disaster as gains made since the country’s ruinous civil war are wiped out by the epidemic, according to a major study released today.
Damage to most sectors of the economy will see growth shrink from 20.1 percent last year to just five percent in 2014, the finance ministry and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) found.
“While priority number one must be to stop the spread of Ebola, protecting Sierra Leone from the wider damage caused by this disease is crucial,” said David McLachlan-Karr, the UN chief in Sierra Leone.
“This report is a sobering warning that shows us that Sierra Leone faces a dramatic GDP loss, significant inflation, and a severe drop in trade and production nationwide across many sectors.”
The report, “The Economic and Social Impact of Ebola Virus Disease in Sierra Leone”, brings together research by the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
It warns that shortages in food and foreign currency, as well as depreciation of the leone, will put further pressure on the recovery.
Ravaged by an 11-year civil war which left the world with images of child soldiers and rebels funded by “blood diamonds” hacking off limbs, Sierra Leone was long sidestepped by investors.
At the end of the conflict in 2002 some 50,000 people had died, public services were non-existent and the economy was in tatters.
But market reforms and improved governance has since seen the mining sector attracting unprecedented investment and creating thousands of jobs and the country was on the slow road to recovery.
The government launched a three-day shutdown in September to contain the virus and has placed five districts under quarantine, containing almost half the population of six million.
Lockdowns and health checkpoints have limited the movement of food and commodities, causing prices to soar and incomes to shrink, the UNDP said.
Children face at least a year of academic disruptions while expectant women are dying in childbirth at “alarming rates” due to fear of hospitals and a collapsed health service, it warned.
“The health sector has all but ceased to operate for non-Ebola cases,” the report says.
