Brooklyn Coffee Shop Owner Gets Slammed After Going On Anti-Semitic Rantreddit
Brooklyn's Bushwick Coffee Shop is facing a firestorm of criticism Thursday, after owner Michael Avila published an anti-semitic rant on social media.
Avila posted a bizarre rant on his personal Facebook page Wednesday in which he laments the gentrification of his neighborhood spearheaded by "greedy infiltrator" Jews.
In case the sentiment of his original statement wasn't clear, Avila then went a step further, posting a screenshot of the rant on the coffee shop's Instagram account , blurring out all of the words except for "greedy infiltrators:"
In a series of follow-up comments posted by Avila on Facebook, he refers to Jewish people as a "problematic group" who, "in typical Illuminati form," have infiltrated the neighborhood "'quietly' and unfairly/greedily."
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the response to Avila's unconventional tirade has been less than enthusiastic.
"I think it's great you're being honest, @bushwickcoffeeshop," reads one comment on the shop's Instagram page. "I wish all business owners would be as honest with their views - it makes it so much easier for the customers to know what establishments to avoid."
Another, posted to Avila's Facebook page adds, "There are so many things wrong with this post, I don't know where to begin. I don't like my coffee with a side of antisemitism . It's bigots like you that are destroying Brooklyn."
NY Eater reports the shop is attempting to make amends with a series of Instagram posts featuring Jewish people he does like .
UPDATE: Thursday -- In a statement to DNAinfo New York , Avila defended his statements, saying he'd been "misunderstood," and had originally intended to condemn the people he perceived as greedy landlords.
"I'm anti-Zionism. It's about politics, it's about greed," he told DNAinfo . "I’m certainly not anti-Semitic. That would stand against everything I believe I stand for."

Ten ways to use competition to your advantageTen ways to use competition to your advantage

'A lot of people see competition as a negative, but there's always a way to leverage it to your advantage.'
QUESTION: How can I use my competition to my advantage?
Out-innovate them
“Look at what your competitors are doing and where they all have assumed the same outcome — whether that be market, product offering, etc. — and then try the opposite of what they're doing. Companies that follow will never prosper. Be the company that takes the lead and explores new territory, and you might end up taking the entire market!”
Liam Martin, Staff.com

“A lot of people see competition as a negative, but there's always a way to leverage it to your advantage. One of the most effective ways of doing that is to find your competition's most glaring weakness and attack it head-on. If you can do this one aspect so well that your competition's customers simply can't ignore you, then you've already won a significant battle.”
James Simpson, GoldFire Studios
“Monitor complaints customers of your top competitors make via Twitter/Facebook, and try to glean insights from them. We launched free shipping after seeing a ton of complaints from customers about shipping charges on some of our competitors’ sites.”
Josh Weiss, Bluegala
Support the larger community
“By listening on social media, you can hear the problems customers are having with your competitors and offer solutions. While you can't offer full tech support, you can offer ideas, generalized information and, most importantly, help them switch to your product. You can jump out in front of your competition by helping people with their products directly.”
Thursday Bram, Hyper Modern Consulting
Partner with them
“I find that your competition can actually be a great partner for two reasons. First, there is often enough to go around — people usually read more than one blog or buy more than one kind of coffee. Second, no product offering is exactly the same. Highlight your differences, package your products or services together, and then share marketing costs.”
Vanessa Van Edwards, Science of People
Analyze your competitors
“Analyzing our competitors has honestly been one of the best sources of data for our business. Analyzing where they put their marketing dollars, the way they organize products on their sites, their best-selling products and site design elements they use have all helped us greatly.”
Pablo Palatnik, ShadesDaddy.com
Learn from their mistakes and successes
“Let them figure out what works and what doesn't, and learn from it — you can often avoid costly mistakes by paying attention to your competitors!”
Alexis Wolfer, The Beauty Bean
Use the advantage of multiple winners
“In a big market, there will likely be multiple winners. You can use that to your advantage. When a competitor gets press in one outlet, try and get similar press in another. This will raise the profile of the industry as a whole. Even if you wind up in second place, the pie has still gotten a lot bigger and your business will have grown.”
Wade Foster, Zapier
Spy on them with SpyFu
“SpyFu exposes the search marketing secret formula of your most successful competitors. Search for any domain, and see every place they've shown up on Google: every keyword they've bought on AdWords, every organic rank and every ad variation in the last six years. Then, use your competitors online activities to improve your own.”
Brett Farmiloe, Markitors
Use the association of professionals
“As fellow professionals, other attorneys are actually one of my best sources of clients and can be great resources for my practice and clientele. I may bring them in for a client because of a conflict with one of my other clients on a project, for extra help during an upswing in business or if the other attorney is just a better fit for the client's immediate legal needs.”

Backup husbands  emotional affairs and the sudden rise of digital infidelityBy Caitlin Dewey October 3 Follow @caitlindewey

As if the negotiation of Facebook officiality and the drawn-out dance of flirty texting weren’t obstacles enough, the Internet has visited a new affliction on modern love: It’s called “digital infidelity,” and it’s probably living on your phone.
A new study by researchers at the University of Indiana found that Facebook users in relationships frequently use the site to keep in touch with “back-burners” — exes or platonic friends they know they could connect with romantically, should their current relationships go south. Men have back-burners at roughly twice the rate of women, the study found. But among both genders, the practice is widespread: On average, respondents in relationships said they had romantic or sexual conversations with two people (!) besides their current partner.
That comes on top of a a recent release by the research agency OnePoll, which suggested as many as half of all women keep in touch with a “back-up husband” they could contact if their current husband doesn’t work out. (“With sites like Facebook and Twitter, it’s easier than ever to stay in touch with an old flame,” a OnePoll rep told the Daily Mail .)
Meanwhile, sex researchers have recently begun to treat “remote infidelity” — emotional cheating, via social media or smartphone — as a valid topic of research. And it’s on the rise, the noted relationship scholar and anthropology professor Helen Fisher told Salon .
“If you’re rushing away from the dinner table with your family to check your e-mail,” Fisher said, “it’s affecting your relationship.”
… and these days, who doesn’t check their e-mail at dinner ?
At some level, this idea of “digital cheating” or “remote infidelity” is just a very old concept in new, trendy clothes. People in relationships have always had back-burners, the Indiana researchers point out — and emotional infidelity, a sort of destructive, unconsummated affair, went down in bars and over cubicle walls long before we had Gchat records of it. To some extent, the Internet has only made these things more visible, better-documented: There are finally texts and emails to back up our suspicions.
But there are other things going on here, as well. Conversing by text or direct message is so inherently one-to-one, and so impossibly easy, that the technology lends a kind of intimacy to its contents — a text can be sent from anywhere, with anyone around, and no one else will know what it says.
(Pew)
And then, of course, there’s that much-discussed specter of the online dating industry : the dual blessing and curse of choice. Multiple studies have demonstrated that people who use social media and cellphones have much larger personal networks than people who do not — about a third larger, on average, Pew found in 2011. And on top of those existing connections, the Internet represents a previously unavailable, untapped source of endless new connections, endless choices.
That’s critical, because the strength of a relationship relies on three things , broadly speaking: satisfaction, emotional investment, and the availability of alternative partners. And that is, this new research suggests, exactly what social media promises — not constant temptation, exactly, but the constant, casual reminder that alternatives exist. Several years ago, when I first met my boyfriend, I remember being wildly offended by a particularly cynical, loud-mouthed acquaintance who mansplained relationships as a kind of mutual settling: “He’s the best you can get, and you’re the best he can get.”
“That’s a really grim take on humanity,” I assured him.
But in terms of social science, there’s actually some truth to that take (… even if it doesn’t, to my relief, totally explain a relationship’s success or failure). The existence of other potential partners changes the core economics of a relationship. And so you become aware of the options, both yours and your partner’s. You become aware of how many times he posts to exes’ Facebook walls, the average time it takes him to text back his female friends, the fact that you’ve fallen out of his Snapchat “top friends,” replaced by his brother-in-law and two women you’ve never met.
And by “you,” of course, I actually mean “me” — because like most honest, Internet-connected humans, I’ve experienced these feelings, too.
(mCouple)
Some companies think they’ve found a solution to this kind of digital-age unease: In fact, an entire creepy, terrifying industry exists around spying on your partner’s digital activity. There is software to log his or her e-mails and text messages; apps to tell you where his phone is; parental control software to tell you which websites she browses.
“You and your partner are madly in love and want to be closer than ever before?” asks mCouple , an app that lets you view every text, call and Facebook messages sent from your partner’s phone. “mCouple is a mobile tracker that can help you stay in touch 24/7!”
That kind of vigilance, it turns out, is probably unnecessary. (Not to mention, pretty unhealthy/weird). It’s counterintuitive, perhaps, but the Indiana University researchers found no correlation between the existence of Facebook back-burners and your partner’s commitment to the relationship. So digital infidelity, much like sexting and going “Facebook official,” might be just another wrinkle in modern love these days.

CNN s Chris Cuomo Says Reza Aslan s  Tone  Shows Why People Are  Fearful  Of Islamreddit
Recently, author Reza Aslan got a little heated on CNN over some rather sweepingly hostile generalizations Bill Maher made about Islam, as well as some questions about Islam's supposed propensity towards violence.
On Thursday, CNN's Chris Cuomo said Aslan's "tone" was an example of why people are scared of Muslims in the first place.
"He wound up kind of demonstrating what people are fearful about when they think of the faith in the first place, which is the hostility of it," he said, as though responding verbally to attacks on your religion is some sort of wild-eyed practice.
"The Muslim world is responsible for a really big part of religious extremism right now," Cuomo continued. "And they are unusually violent. They're unusually barbaric in the places where it is happening. And it's happening there more there than it is in other places. Do you therefore want to generalize? Of course not. But you do want to call a situation what it is."
While he talked, the chyron beneath him read "IS ISLAM VIOLENT? OR PEACEFUL?"

Food Stamp Enrollment Underscores Illinois Jobs Crisisreddit
In Illinois, people are more likely to end up on food stamps than they are to find a job.
Nearly five years since the end of the Great Recession, Illinois is lagging behind the rest of the Midwest in job creation, creating an environment where opportunity and hope for a better future seem out of reach for those who are down on their luck.
Today, there are nearly 300,000 fewer Illinoisans working than in January 2008 - on top of that, there are 157,000 fewer payroll jobs in the state.
The situation is particularly dire for minorities. Fewer than half of black adults can find work, and the Latino employment rate has fallen 6.4 percentage points since 2008.
Things are so bad that food-stamp enrollment in Illinois outpaces job creation by nearly 2-to-1, and the number of Illinoisans dependent on food stamps has risen by 745,000 in the recession era.
The food-stamps benchmark, especially when compared to other Midwest states, provides troubling insight into just how desperate the situation is in Illinois.
While Illinois has gained just 250,000 payroll jobs and added 425,000 Illinoisans to the food-stamp rolls since 2010, job creation is outpacing food-stamp enrollment in every other Midwest state. Michigan, North Dakota and Missouri have all seen food-stamp enrollment decline since 2010.
This reality doesn't jive with headlines crowing about the state's dropping unemployment rate and the fanciful celebrations of state politicians.
Over the past five months, the state's jobless rate has fallen to 6.7 percent from 8.4 percent - but because of the 82,000 people who have dropped out of the workforce, the unemployment rate doesn't mean much at all. That's because unemployed people who stop looking for work aren't counted toward the unemployment rate. In fact, the share of Illinoisans successfully looking for work is at a 35-year low.
It all comes back to opportunity... or a lack thereof.
Companies aren't hiring. New businesses aren't opening up. People down on their luck can't find work -- because there simply isn't enough to go around.
Illinois has taken a backward approach to turning the tides on its jobs environment: giving big companies money to do business within state lines.
The state gives millions of dollars in tax breaks each year to giants such as CME Group ($77 million annually), Sears ($15 million annually) and Motorola ($10 million annually).
But while politicians dole out funds to well-established businesses, homegrown entrepreneurship is dwindling. In 2013, Illinois had one of the lowest rates of entrepreneurial activity in the nation, according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity , a leading indicator of new business creation in the United States.
These measurements matter, because nationwide nearly half of all private-sector jobs come from small businesses, and two-thirds of the jobs created in the last 20 years came from small businesses.
And so the cycle continues -- corporate handouts lead to a decrease in small-business growth, which leads to fewer jobs, which leads to fewer opportunities, meaning many are forced to turn to government assistance to get by. Government officials see an uptick in joblessness and food-stamp enrollment, and give out more corporate handouts in the hope of spurring economic growth... and the cycle repeats ad nauseam. Illinois can't carry on this way much longer.

A Speech Is All About the Word  Aboutreddit
Audiences are self-centered.
Famous choreographer George Balanchine once mocked the hapless gentleman who goes to the theatre to cry over his own life: "I'm married," he mimicked, "my wife and children have left me, and I'm unhappy and feel that I'm going to kill myself. And that's what I think art is - people should pay me for my story."
Your customers think the same way.  I say this without cynicism, or disrespect.  They rightfully expect you to aim for the center of their lives and to immediately grasp the predicaments they face every day.
That means you need to talk about them not just to them when you deliver a speech, to your customers at a trade show, or your colleagues at a staff meeting.  Talk about the audience.
Take a lesson from FDR's first inaugural speech in 1933, when the Great Depression brought great suffering.  The phrase that is most often quoted from that address is "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," but I am more interested in the technique behind these words:
We face our common difficulties... Values have shrunk to fantastic levels: taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; and the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.  More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return.
This speech resonated because most Americans could recognized their own lives coming to life in the words.
On a lighter note, NPR's Terry Gross, of Fresh Air fame, used a similar approach in a graduation speech at Bryn Mawr this past spring:
So many of you know me as the person you were forced to listen to in your parent's car, or in the carpool on your way to and from school every day.  And here you are on one of the most important days of your lives, forced to listen to me again.  And you're probably wondering, 'So what's she gonna do today, ask questions?'
Like FDR and Terry Gross, try to read the minds of the listeners.  Tap into their pain, their fears, their aspirations.
Here's another tip: Add an "About You" section to the navigation bar on your website.  In fact, make that the landing page.  If the viewers see an explanation of their needs there, they'll in turn want to get to know you.
Did I guess your thoughts?  Hope so.  I tried to write about you.

Wild world of earnings kicks off this weekWild world of earnings kicks off this week

The thrill of surprise and the agony of the miss. Earnings season returns this week.
Alcoa (AA) unofficially kicks off earnings season Wednesday. The aluminum company is still steaming from being tossed out of the Dow last year. The stock is on fire and so are earnings. Take that! Adjusted earnings are expected to jump 91% in the quarter. And the stock. It’s up more than 40% this year. Not bad for a Dow reject.
Pepsico (PEP) reports its results Thursday. The food maker is a good measure of global demand. Earnings aren’t exactly fizzy. Adjusted profit is seen rising 4% during the quarter. But guess what? Pepsico has a knock at beating estimates. It’s given investors pleasant earnings surprises the past five straight quarters. The stock’s up more than 10% this year.
Investors will also brace for news from Janet Yellen’s Fed. The Fed releases its meeting minutes Wednesday. If the words “higher” and “interest rates” are even in the same sentence, watch out. Investors will probably get cranky and start yellin’.
Get ready for a wild world of markets news this week.
 

Modi s BJP backstabbing Maharashtra: SenaUpdated: October 7, 2014 02:03 IST
Where was your respect when you broke away, Sena asks Modi

In its editorial mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the Sena has attacked Mr. Modi's speech at a poll rally
The Shiv Sena on Monday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi where his respect for Balasaheb Thackeray was when the BJP broke its alliance with the Sena over seat-sharing for the Maharashtra Assembly elections.
During a rally in Maharashtra on Sunday, Mr. Modi said that he would not utter a single word against the Shiv Sena “due to respect for [its founder] Balasaheb Thackeray,” who passed away in 2012. “This is the first Assembly election after the demise of Balasaheb Thackeray, and I will not say anything against the Shiv Sena this time,” he had said.
The Sena mouthpiece Saamna, in its editorial, said: “It is good that he respects the Shiv Sena supremo. Even we respect Mr. Modi. But where did this respect go when it broke the 25-year-old alliance? A more fitting tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray would have been the maintenance of the saffron alliance.”
The editorial claimed that the BJP was trying to loot Maharashtra. “What was the purpose of Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel’s visit to Mumbai recently? She told industrialists in Maharashtra to move base to Gujarat. This is trying to plunder Maharashtra,” it said. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray too had raised the same issue in his rally on Sunday.
The editorial also slammed the BJP for invoking Chhatrapati Shivaji, a State icon. Calling it “hypocrisy,” Saamna said those who did not celebrate Shiv Jayanti in their lifetime, now claimed the blessings of Shivaji Maharaj.
“The BJP might be armed with the power of money and intellect, and the art of backstabbing people, but Shivaji maharaj’s blessings are not so cheap. From where will you bring the valour?” the editorial asked.

If the market hates uncertainty  why is Hong Kongs risingThe Future of Hong Kong
October 6, 2014
In Hong Kong, a resolution to the recent unrest is as uncertain as ever: Neither side in the conflict seems to know what it’s doing  after the government’s sternly-worded ultimatum to protestors to end their occupation of parts of the city passed today.
Despite the adage that the market hates uncertainty, investors bid up Hong Kong stocks for the second consecutive trading session. Today’s gain was the biggest in a month for the city’s benchmark equity index.
Still, the Hang Seng remains a bit below where it was before the protests kicked off 10 days ago, extending losses on stocks that were already falling before pro-democracy protesters took to the streets en masse:
Share

Unsurprisingly, the sharp swings in stocks—both up and down—since the protests began have pushed up a gauge of volatility, which also usually makes investors nervous:

The protests will undoubtedly impose costs on the city. The disruption could cost retailers HK$2 billion ($260 million) in lost sales, as shoppers from the mainland stay away. The World Bank has trimmed its forecast for economic growth this year, while the ratings agency Fitch expressed doubts about the “basic question of governance” in the territory today.
But even if the stand-off persists, the impact on Hong Kong’s main industry—financial services—will likely be modest, as it has been thus far . And as a regional financial hub, the trends in Hong Kong’s market don’t necessarily reflect local conditions. Everything from relaxed rules on second mortgages in mainland China to the bullish outlook for Macau casinos has pushed up the value of Hong Kong-listed stocks in recent sessions.
Some sectors have fared better than others. Tech stocks are actually up since the protests began:

Financial markets are sometimes seen as possessing powers of prediction that they don’t actually have, so reading anything specific into a couple of up days at the Hong Kong exchange is tricky. But past experience shows that the city’s stock market is sensitive to Beijing’s attempts to take independence away from the crucial finance and trading center . Back in the pre-handover days, reports that China was planning to put a mainlander in charge or station troops in the territory were met with much sharper drops in Hong Kong stocks than those seen in recent days.
That’s cold comfort for protesters as they dig in for a second week on the streets, but it’s worth noting nonetheless.

India growing as a desirable holiday destination: Surveytravel and commuting
Overseas travellers increasingly show interest in India as a “desirable” holiday destination, as hotels in the country have been experiencing a large uptake in tourist interest, according to a recent TripAdvisor survey.
“It is encouraging to see significant increase in traveller interest from both emerging and established inbound markets, confirming India’s appeal as a desirable holiday destination for travellers from both near and afar,” TripAdvisor’s Territory Manager for India Deepesh Saxena said in a release here.
The study examined TripAdvisor website data to find which markets had the largest increases in traffic, taking into account natural growth, according to year-on-year growth in share of user sessions, from major inbound travel markets, looking at Indian accommodations for full year July 2012 to July 2013 and July 2013 to July 2014.
The survey said that with traveller interest growing by 48 per cent year-on-year, Singapore leads the list when it comes to increased interest from travellers looking at Indian hotels, representing an increasingly important source of business for Indian accommodations.
Emerging markets like Ukraine and China have also been showing signs of promise as new inbound markets for India with traveller interest increasing by 43 per cent and 33 per cent, year-on-year, respectively, it said.
These markets with the biggest increase in traveller interest for India based on travellers looking at Indian accommodations are consistent with top markets researching India as a travel destination on the TripAdvisor’s website.
According to TripAdvisor’s survey data, travellers from India, the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Australia contributed the most number of reviews on Indian accommodations during 2013.
The survey also found that Italian and Japanese travellers are least satisfied with accommodations in India.
In 2013, Italian and Japanese travellers from these two countries gave Indian accommodations an average TripAvsior review rating of 4 and 4.02, out of a possible five, compared to the 4.10 global average review rating, it pointed out.
However, Israeli travellers are the most satisfied guests, and gave Indian accommodations an average TripAdvisor review rating of 4.23, in 2013.
Irish and American travellers are also among nationalities most pleased with Indian properties, giving them an average review rating of 4.25.
The study also showed that while Goa, Kerala and Maharashtra were the top three most searched Indian destinations in the past year, it is accommodations in Rajasthan that commend the highest average review rating of 4.3, out of a possible five.

Goldman Sachs exits Bangalore Four Season pr...Goldman Sachs exits Bangalore Four Season property

(The project is a JV involving…)
MUMBAI: Global private equity major Goldman Sachs has sold its entire 73 per cent stake in City View Bangalore Properties to a JV floated by Blackstone and realty player Embassy Group for an undisclosed amount, exiting the project after several failed attempts since 2012.
Consultant firm J Sagar Associates, which advised Goldman, confirmed the deal but provided no details. Neither Goldman nor other PE funds could be immediately reached for comments.
City View Bangalore is building a hotel under Canada's Four Seasons brand besides apartments and offices in the garden city.
The Wall Street bellwether held 73 per cent stake in City View Bangalore through its real estate unit Whitehall. The remaining 27 per cent is held by Westcourt and Century Real Estate Holdings.
Whitehall is developing India's second Four Seasons hotel and residences on a 6.5-acre plot in the Karnataka capital, J Sagar Associates said in a statement today.
The American PE player had reportedly picked up the stake for Rs 450 crore, which includes the cost of the land.
The project comprises a 260-key hotel, 110 luxury branded apartments that will also be operated by the Canadian hospitality chain, 60,000 sq ft of retail space and 1.5 lakh sq ft of office space.
Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone and Infosys founders have reportedly bought homes in the Four Seasons residences coming up in Hebbal, a fast-developing northern suburb which lies en route to the international airport.
The project is a JV involving Goldman, the majority stakeholder, the London-based project developer Westcourt and Bangalore-based Century Real Estate Holdings, the land owner.
Corporate law firm Amarchand Mangaldas advised Embassy and Blackstone in the deal.
Earlier, Goldman was reportedly in talks with a host of entities and individuals for selling it stake. These included realty firms Prestige Group, K Raheja Corp, Nitesh Estates, RMZ and a few ultra HNIs along with PE groups such as Urban Infrastrucutre Opportunities Fund , and even Rana Kapoor, one of the promoters of Yes Bank, and NRI tycoon Ravi Pillai.
It was also reportedly talking to PE major Blackstone, GIC of Singapore and Tishman Speyer to sell its stake.
In June 2012, there were reports that Goldman was on the verge of closing the bids for exiting the property for about $100 million, but that effort failed. In September 2013, too, there were reports to the same effect.
The 1-million sq ft mixed use development has an enterprise valuation of about Rs 1,100 crore, of which around Rs 200 crore is debt.

Equities closed a fifth straight week of advances Friday, boosted by accommodative actions from central banks in China and Europe. That factor could continue boosting markets as sources told Reuters that the Chinese leadership and central bank were ready to cut interest rates again and loosen lending restrictions. Such policy changes in the world's second-biggest economy could spur more market gains.
"The carry-over effect from China, taken with the fact that the U.S. is pretty healthy, and you have a market with a bias to trend higher, especially on the cyclical front," said Mike Gibbs, who helps oversee more than $500 billion as co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James in Memphis.

27 years and waiting …
Karnataka
With no stenographer in the CGIT, 82-year-old awaits order
It has been a long-drawn-out legal battle of over two decades. K.V. Sreenivasan, a former employee of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), still awaits closure after almost 27 years. The 82-year-old’s case is before the Central Government Industrial Tribunal (CGIT). The latest hitch: the lack of a stenographer/judgment writer in the Labour Court.
Mr. Sreenivasan, who has spent nearly Rs. 8 lakh on fighting his case, has been seeking payment of arrears as assistant manager. “Arrears have been pending since 1979. Promotions as joint deputy manager and joint manager have also not been given. They have remained on paper alone,” he said.
It all started when Mr. Sreenivasan was dismissed from service in 1989 for refusing to go on transfer to Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, from Bangalore in 1987. He in fact reported to work for a day in Tuticorin, but was called back to Bangalore for an inquiry as the CBI was conducting raids. He claimed he was promised a transfer to Bangalore. Since that did not come through, he refused to return to Tuticorin, following which he was dismissed from the company. Following the intervention by the Karnataka High Court and Supreme Court, the dismissal was converted to compulsory retirement in 1993.
When asked to respond to allegations of delay in handing over Mr. Sreenivasan’s arrears, FCI’s Bangalore office, in a statement, said: “The cases are pending before the CGIT, Bangalore, and are posted for award. Necessary action will be taken on receipt of the award.”
An advocate who appears regularly for cases in the CGIT, Bangalore, said Mr. Sreenivasan’s was not an isolated case.
“All arguments in this case are over. But, there is no stenographer in the court. Many cases have been held up as the judgments have to be transcribed, corrected and then sent to the Union Ministry of Labour in New Delhi,” he said.
The advocate also explained that unlike in regular courts where judgments are pronounced by judges, in the CGIT, the awards are kept secret.
“The award passed is sent to the Ministry where it is vetted and then published. The award is enforceable 30 days after being published. Usually, they are published within two months. In this case, it has been almost eight months,” the advocate said.

Nikesh leads Softbank invasion into HollywoodNikesh leads Softbank invasion into Hollywood
Reuters  New York, October 03, 2014
First Published: 22:42 IST(3/10/2014) | Last Updated: 22:46 IST(3/10/2014)
Comments
Softbank Corp’s investment in a major Hollywood movie studio represents the entry of two new players in the US entertainment industry — the Japanese telecommunications company and former Google-executive Nikesh Arora.
Two months after unexpectedly exiting Google for SoftBank, Arora struck a $250 million deal on Thursday for a minority stake in Legendary Entertainment, which has produced hits such as The Dark Knight and The Hangover.
Earlier, he had tried unsuccessfully to strike a partnership with DreamWorks Animation, sources said.
As CEO of California-based SoftBank Internet and Media Inc, Arora is charged with investing in and operating media and digital media companies, including music, e-commerce and gaming, said one person close to Softbank.
Softbank, owned by legendary investor Masayoshi Son, owns US mobile carrier Sprint and is the largest investor in China e-commerce company Alibaba.
At the search engine giant, Arora oversaw sales, marketing and partnerships, an outsider’s job at a company, where engineering skills are prized above all else.
Arora, who has previously worked with T-Mobile Europe, became one of the most powerful Google executives, and the highest paid in 2012, when he made $51 million in cash and stock.
Several former colleagues described Arora as very effective at getting results, often by eschewing the collaborative, consensus-based culture within Google.
A representative for Arora declined to make him available or respond to comments. Google also declined to comment.
Arora is “perfectly placed” to build Softbank’s media portfolio, said Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of advertising group WPP, citing Arora’s “knowledge gleaned from his years at Google about the media community.”
At Google, Arora advocated for the acquisition of online movie company Netflix in 2009, according to one former Google employee who was present when Arora pitched the idea to Google’s senior executive team.

EC issues notice to Gadkari for inducing voters to take bribecommentEC issues notice to Gadkari for ‘inducing voters to take bribe’ comment
Express News Service | New Delhi |       October 7, 2014 1:19 am
Comments
This is the time when illegally earned money can go to poor. Therefore, do not say no to Laxmi. But think while you vote. Your vote should be for the development of Maharashtra, he said addressing people.
The Election Commission has asked Union minister Nitin Gadkari to explain his remark allegedly suggesting that people in Maharashtra accept bribes for votes. The EC sent a notice to the Roads, Transport and Highways Minister for violating the model code of conduct and asked him to explain his stand by 5 pm on October 8.
The action follows a report from the District Election Officer and District Magistrate of Latur, who said that while addressing a meeting at Nilenga constituency in Latur on October 5, Gadkari made “statements to suggesting that voters take a bribe”. A copy of the video has been sent to the EC.

“I have some skill of predicting the future by way of face reading. You have an opportunity of ‘Laxmi darshan’ in next 10 days,” Gadkari had allegedly told the poll rally.
“Special people will get foreign made, ordinary people will get local brand… In these days of inflation… eat what you wish and drink what you desire… This is the time when illegally earned money can go to poor. Do not say no to ‘Laxmi’. But think while you vote. Your vote should be for development of Maharashtra,” Gadkari allegedly added.
 

Warren Buffetts Latest Deal Has Officially Made Car Dealerships CoolAlways a trendsetter.
Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images
Are car dealerships a good investment? Warren Buffett thinks so, and that's good enough for the market.
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday agreed to buy the Van Tuyl Group, the fifth-largest auto dealership in America with $9 billion in sales. For Buffett, it expanded a transportation portfolio that already included planes (NetJets) and trains (the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway). Once the acquisition is completed, the dealership will be renamed Berkshire Hathaway Automotive.

Since news of the sale broke, shares of auto retailers have traded up; when Warren Buffett buys a car dealership, everyone else gets on board . Shares of AutoNation and Penske Automotive Group, among others, spiked after the announcement. But over at BloombergView, auto-industry consultant Edward Niedermeyer is questioning the wisdom of the market's quick reaction:
Perhaps the biggest reason to think twice before following the Oracle is that the U.S. auto market is returning to its traditionally sustainable sales peak of between 16 million and 17 million units per year. While auto sales have been one of the few bright spots in the retail sector during a slow economic recovery, there's no reason to think that will last. Much of that growth is due to the expansion of auto credit, particularly through  subprime lending and longer loan terms , so there may not be much juice left in the tank for  further growth .
On the other hand, Buffett isn't stopping his auto investments at that. "I fully expect we'll buy a lot more auto dealerships over time," he told CNBC . In the meantime, go ahead and make all the Planes, Trains and Automobiles jokes you've got.

Shiv Sena launches sharp attack on PM Modi, says BJP 'backstabbed' it
22
0
Mumbai: A sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi by his erstwhile ally Shiv Sena, which also equated BJP with the "corrupt" Congress and NCP marked the electoral discourse in Maharashtra on Monday.
The Sena claimed that BJP, under the leadership of Modi, "backstabbed" the party and blamed it for the end of their 25-year-old alliance just days ahead of the state Assembly polls on October 15.
A day after Modi steered clear of attacking his former ally as a "tribute" to its late supremo Bal Thackeray, the Sena also raised questions over the 'new-found' respect shown by the Prime Minister for him.
Shiv Sena also blamed BJP for the end of their 25-year-old alliance just days ahead of the state Assembly polls on October 15.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #bjp #shiv sena #narendra modi
"Modi says that he will not attack the Sena in his speeches as he has respect for Balasaheb Thackeray. We too respect the PM. "But when you back-stabbed us merely on the issue of seat sharing, where did that respect disappear then? Did you not think of Balasaheb before breaking the alliance forged on the principles of Hindutva," the Sena said in its editorial mouthpiece 'Saamana'.
Equating the BJP with the "corrupt" Congress and the NCP, the Sena said that people in Maharashtra have now realized who are the "real and hidden" thieves of the state.
"It is a known fact that the Congress and the NCP have looted Maharashtra. But for what purpose did the CM of Gujarat Anandiben Patel visit Maharashtra? If she asks all the industrialists to set base in Gujarat, leaving Maharashtra behind, this too amounts to looting Maharashtra," the editorial said.
"How do you define keeping an eye on the coffers of the state and making a deal of Mumbai (for the benefit of Gujarat)? Is this not looting Maharashtra ? And then talking about the blessings of Shivaji Maharaj is nothing but a farce," the Sena said.  "Never before has anyone opened a market of Shivaji Maharaj's blessings," it added.
In his election rallies, Modi had invoked Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj on several occasions.  The Prime Minister while campaigning at Tasgaon in Sangli district yesterday had said that he would "not utter a single word" against the Sena out of his respect for Bal Thackeray.
Modi also drew flak from NCP chief Sharad Pawar after the Prime Minister launched a sharp attack on him during his poll rallies in Maharashtra. "Somebody please tell him about my election record. I have fought 14 elections so far. Will I shirk from polls," Pawar said, addressing a rally at Ahmedpur in Marathwada region.
Modi had on Sunday said that Pawar chose the Rajya Sabha route and did not contest Lok Sabha polls as he was aware that the "ship (UPA government) was sinking."  "I am lucky that the country's Prime Minister does not see any leader other than me," Pawar quipped, referring to Modi's diatribe against him.  "What does Modi say in these rallies? I can understand if he says something of national interest.
One can also understand if he speaks about changing the life of the common man. But if you take his speech into consideration, the maximum attack is on Sharad Pawar," the NCP chief said.

Why public investment really is a free lunchOctober 6, 2014 2:12 pm
Why public investment really is a free lunch
By Lawrence Summers
©AFP
It has been joked that the letters IMF stand for “it’s mostly fiscal”. The International Monetary Fund has long been a stalwart advocate of austerity as the route out of financial crisis, and every year it chastises dozens of countries for their fiscal indiscipline. Fiscal consolidation – a euphemism for cuts to government spending – is a staple of the fund’s rescue programmes. A year ago the IMF was suggesting that the US had a fiscal gap of as much as 10 per cent of gross domestic product.
The FT’s A-List
The A-List provides timely, insightful comment on the topics that matter, from globally renowned leaders, policy makers and commentators
All of this makes the IMF’s recently published World Economic Outlook a remarkable and important document. In its flagship publication, the IMF advocates substantially increased public infrastructure investment, and not just in the US but much of the world. It asserts that when unemployment is high, as it is in much of the industrialised world, the stimulative impact will be greater if investment is paid for by borrowing, rather than cutting other spending or raising taxes. Most notably, the IMF asserts that properly designed infrastructure investment will reduce rather than increase government debt burdens. Public infrastructure investments can pay for themselves.
Why does the IMF reach these conclusions? Consider a hypothetical investment in a new highway financed entirely with debt. Assume – counterfactually and conservatively – that the process of building the highway provides no stimulative benefit. Further assume that the investment earns only a 6 per cent real return, also a very conservative assumption given widely accepted estimates of the benefits of public investment. Then, annual tax collections adjusted for inflation would increase by 1.5 per cent of the amount invested, since the government claims about 25 cents out of every additional dollar of income. Real interest costs, that is interest costs less inflation, are below 1 per cent in the US and much of the industrialised world over horizons of up to 30 years. So infrastructure investment actually makes it possible to reduce burdens on future generations.
In fact, this calculation understates the positive budgetary impact of well-designed infrastructure investment, as the IMF recognised. It neglects the tax revenue that comes from the stimulative benefit of putting people to work constructing infrastructure, as well as the possible long-run benefits that come from combating recession. It neglects the reality that deferring infrastructure renewal places a burden on future generations just as surely as does government borrowing.

Will take whatever retaliatory action needed on ceasefire violations:BSFPress Trust of India | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 9:28 pm
Saying that it did not expect Pakistan to carry out such an intensified shelling and firing in Jammu on the day of Eid on Monday, BSF has assured that the force will take whatever retaliatory action it has to.
“Whatever retaliatory action BSF has to take, will be undertaken,” Director General of BSF D K Pathak told reporters here.

“Our force is a professional force and we will respond very professionally to the Pak firing,” he said.
Pathak flew to Jammu from New Delhi and rushed to R S Pura border belt to chair a meeting of top officers of the Jammu Frontier to review the situation emerging in view of shelling and firing in the Arnia belt.
“The incident is not a good incident. There has been casualties, but we have responded to it,” he said.
“We were not expecting that they will resort to such an intensified shelling and firing on Eid,” Pathak added.
“Every ceasefire violation has been engineered by them and we are not responsible for any ceasefire violation,” he said.
In one of the worst ceasefire violations by Pakistan, five villagers were killed and 34 injured today in heavy mortar shelling and firing from across the international border and Line of Control in Jammu and Poonch sectors.

One buried alive in Guwahati-Shillong highwaylandslidePrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 6, 2014 8:59 pm
One person was buried alive when a massive landslide carried away several vehicles including small cars on National Highway 40 at Umling in Meghalaya, 60 kms from Shillong on Sunday evening. A team of the NDRF, backed up by the state police took nearly 16 hours to clear the road on Monday.
Ri Bhoi district Deputy Superintendent of Police Rymphang Pde said the highway, also called GS Road for the first 100 kms as its connects Guwahati with Shillong, was partially cleared after a night-long exercise by the NDRF, police and local volunteers. “We have cleared a part of the road and regulated traffic since today morning,” he said.
The DySP said while six vehicles were trapped in the massive landslide, all the occupants managed to escape except for one person. The lone victim, identified as one Dhan Bahadur, hailed from Nagaland and his body was dug out from the debris on Sunday evening. A family from Guwahati which was travelling back from Shillong, had a miraculous escape even after the car was pushed away by about 100 metres by the slush.
While the landslide brought down rocks, trees and soil covering about 100 metres of NH40 whose four-laning is still going on, local MLA Jemino Mawthoh blamed the highway construction company engaged by NHAI for frequent landslides occurring in the recent months.
Two major landslides had occurred near this spot on September 22 following heavy rains. On Sunday, however there was no rain, though the exposed hill-slopes had reportedly become soft due to last month’s heavy rains.
“Earth-cutting has been carried out very unscientifically during the four-lane construction, leading to frequent landslides on the Guwahati-Shillong highway. NHAI should institute an inquiry into whether specifications have been followed or not while cutting hills to widen the highway,” the legislator said.

Police book two dozen people for raising anti-India slogans inJ&KPrint
Express News Service | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:08 pm
The Jammu and Kashmir police on Monday booked nearly two dozen people for raising anti-India slogans at Kishtwar.
Two of the people have been arrested, sources said, identifying them as Saqib Shah resident of Puhie and Muddasir of Baghwan area.
Giving details, sources said that trouble erupted in the town soon after the Eid prayers at Chowghan Maidan when some local Muslim youth tried to take out a procession. Some of the processionists raised anti-India and pro-ISISI slogans.
As provocative slogans had led to communal tension in the town leading to wide spread violence and arson on Eid last year, the police immediately swung into action and registered a case. While two people have been arrested, more are likely as police are looking for others raising provocative slogans during Eid procession.

Flipkarts sale draws flak on socialmediaFlipkart’s Big Billion Day sale on Monday brought with it some unwanted backlash on the social media.
ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 9:51 pm
Billed as India’s largest discount sale ever, e-commerce company Flipkart’s Big Billion Day sale on Monday brought with it some unwanted backlash on the social media, with disgruntled shoppers taking to Facebook and Twitter to vent their ire over server “crashes” and “misleading” pricing claims.
The website’s servers seemed clearly overloaded within a couple of hours of the sale opening early in the morning, with many users complained of landing on error pages or seeing their transactions being interrupted midway through. Additionally, consumers claim that offers advertised by Flipkart in the newspapers are not available on the website.
“The traffic was heavy but server did not crash,” Flipkart spokesperson said, but refused to give any details. A statement by Flipkart founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said: “Our technology team has been dedicated towards addressing errors and providing constant support to accommodate the largest scale of traffic and customer visits e-commerce has witnessed across the country.” CEO Sachin Bansal claimed his company hit its target of $100 million in gross merchandise value (value of goods sold) in 10 hours.
The day also saw significant offline and online activity by Flipkart’s rivals Snapdeal and Amazon India, with Snapdeal runing a campaign with the tagline: “For others it’s a big day. For us, today is no different.”  Amazon has been running a sale from 4-6 October, calling it the Mission to Mars weekend.
“Snapdeal had a record breaking day of sales on October 6, 2014. We witnessed sales of over a crore rupees a minute, with lakhs of products being sold in a single day,” its Co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl said in a statement.
Flipkart had run massive marketing campaigns, with advertisements splashed across newspapers and outdoor media announcing its discount sale on Monday. Within hours, though, exasperated users took to Twitter, Facebook and blogging to attack the company’s pricingclaiming that in some instances, the “discounted offerings” were actually priced higher than on rival e-tailing sites while in other cases, the mark-up prices were seen to have been first hiked, and then ‘discounted’ to a prices close to market rates. Additionally, consumers claimed that offers advertised by Flipkart in the newspapers are not available on the website.

EC notice to Gadkari over his alleged  bribe  remarkComments
The Election Commission on Monday issued a show cause notice to Union minister Nitin Gadkari for "statements to the effect of inducing the voters to take bribe" during campaigning in Maharashtra assembly polls.
Holding that the statements prima facie violated the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct, the EC has asked Gadkari to file his reply by October 8 failing which action would be taken ex-parte.
In the notice, the EC said district electoral officer of Latur (Maharashtra) had informed the poll watchdog that Gadkari, while addressing a public meeting in Nilenga assembly constituency on Sunday, allegedly made "statements to the effect of inducing the voters to take bribe if offered by someone and then decide how to vote".
Read: Gadkari says journalists should accept 'packages', faces flak
According to the English translation of the speech made by the former BJP president in Marathi, he had allegedly said: "Now, I am watching your faces and I have some skill of predicting the future by way of face reading. You have an opportunity of "Laxmi darshan" in next 10 days. Special people to get foreign made, ordinary people to get local brand...
"All are Gandhivadis asking for Rs. 5000. In these days of inflation, keep one thing in mind, eat what you wish and drink what you desire. Keep whatever you get. This is the time when illegally earned money can go to poor. Therefore, do not say no to Laxmi. But think while you vote. Your vote should be for the development of Maharashtra."
EC said his statement amounts to "abetting and promoting the electoral offence of bribery" within the meaning of Section 171 B read with Section 17l E of the IPC as it includes offering food, drink or entertainment.
Maharashtra is going to polls on October 15.
Gadkari allegedly told people that while women will get sarees, the young boys will get pant-shirt.
The EC has sent him copies of the CD carrying his speech along with the translated version of the operative portion of his Marathi speech in English.
The poll panel also reminded Gadkari of sub para (4) of para 1 of the Model Code of Conduct which states that parties and candidates shall avoid scrupulously all activities which are 'corrupt practices' and offences under the election law, such as bribing of voters.

Facebook shuttle drivers to Mark Zuckerberg: We want a union

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Teamsters are organizing Facebook shuttle bus drivers after extensive coverage from USA TODAY brought to light tough working conditions.
These contract workers are part of a new and growing underclass who work inside some of the world's wealthiest companies. VPC
The top Teamsters official for Northern California has sent a letter urging Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to "encourage" its contractor to allow the drivers to "bargain a fair contract."
"It is reminiscent of a time when noblemen were driven around in their coaches by their servants. Frankly, little has changed; except the noblemen are your employees, and the servants are the bus drivers who carry them back and forth each day," Teamsters official Rome Aloise wrote to Zuckerberg.
This is the second time the Teamsters have tried to organize the Facebook drivers, but the first time the union has gotten a majority of Facebook shuttle drivers to sign cards asking Local 853 to represent them.
Facebook spokeswoman Vanessa Chan declined to comment.
Jeff Leonoudakis, president of Facebook's shuttle bus contractor, Loop Transportation, did not return a call requesting comment.
It's a long, tiring haul for Silicon Valley bus drivers
In a series of articles in USA TODAY, Facebook drivers opened up for the first time about working marathon days for low pay in Silicon Valley, one of the nation's most expensive spots.
Their chief complaint: working a split shift, meaning their day is split into two shifts, one in the morning and another in the evening, but the drivers are not paid for the hours in between.
Bus contractors often try to underbid each other on contracts, contributing to the problem, Aloise said.
"A very simple fix to the bus driver's horrific work schedule is to pay the contractor who employs the drivers enough money to fix the split shift problem and to enable the contractor to pay a wage that allows these drivers to improve their lives," Aloise said. "Certainly, Facebook, Google, Apple and the rest can afford to do this. I am hopeful that we can make this enough of an issue that these companies do the right thing."
Companies from Google to Apple outsource service jobs such as janitors and security guards to outside contractors to lower costs, creating an underclass of workers in Silicon Valley.
Even though they work inside companies famous for showering workers with six-figure salaries, stock options and perks, many of these workers put in long hours for low pay and few, if any, benefits.
Studies show that the nationwide trend of outsourcing these positions has led to declining wages, eroding health and safety conditions and a lower standard of living for workers, most of whom are black and Hispanic.
High-tech's service workers are a growing underclass
Service workers told USA TODAY they have trouble piecing together a living on their wages in Silicon Valley.
"One thing that is clear with the Silicon Valley companies is that they have changed society in many ways, in most cases, some would argue for the better," Aloise said. "However, they have not done much to help those workers on the bottom rung who support them and enable them to make the extraordinary amounts of money that they enjoy."
Google signaled last week that Silicon Valley companies may be rethinking the outsourcing arrangement.
The technology giant said it planned to add more than 200 security guards to its payroll rather than relying on an outside contractor. The security guards will then have the same benefits as other Google employees, Google said.
Teamsters are targeting shuttle bus drivers at Silicon Valley companies because they have one of the most challenging service jobs in high-tech: navigating congested city streets and highways to ferry tech workers to and from work.
They make between $18 and $20 an hour, which doesn't stretch far in the Bay Area.
But the toughest part of the job: The split shift.
Drivers are not permitted to take another job between shifts and driving home is usually not an option, Facebook drivers told USA TODAY this summer.
So the drivers slept sitting up in a chair in the break room or in the front seats of their cars. When the weather was warm, they had to cover their cars with blankets to cool off.
Report: Tech creating black, Hispanic underclass
Jimmy Maerina, 54, said Loop Transportation responded to coverage in USA TODAY by setting up a lounge in a trailer on the property in San Carlos, Calif.
The lounge is equipped with reclining chairs which are too uncomfortable for taking naps between shifts, Maerina said. Bunk beds promised by the company have not materialized, he said.
Maerina said he's grateful that the news media has focused on the tough working conditions for shuttle drivers.
"Without you, nothing would have been done," he said.

12 Narmada project affected people arrested for suicide bid

Vadodara: Twelve persons, affected by the Narmada Dam project, tried to commit suicide by jumping into the Narmada canal near Naswadi village in the district, but they were pulled out and arrested, police said.
Demanding jobs and land against their ancestral lands which they were forced to give for the Narmada Dam project, the 12 persons, including a woman, went to the canal and threatened to commit suicide if their demands were not met, a police official said.
"They belong to project-affected families who wanted jobs as well as land, as compensation for what they surrendered for the Narmada Dam project in Kevadia to the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNL)" Naswadi Circle Police Inspector BM Vasava said.
Demanding jobs and land against their ancestral lands which they were forced to give for the Narmada Dam project, the 12 persons, including a woman, went to the canal and threatened to commit suicide if their demands were not met, a police official said.
After gathering at the canal, all of them jumped into it to protest against the compensation given by SSNL. However, local policemen pulled them out of the canal and arrested them. "All of them were rescued and sent to the
hospital for treatment," Vasava said.
The 12, along with others, were shifted to Baroli-based settlements in south Gujarat as part of the state government's rehabilitation programme for project-affected people.
One of them, who jumped into the canal and was pulled out by police, said, "Benefits should be given to all members of project-affected families, as five acres of land given to one family member is not enough to sustain the
entire family."
Work up to the height of 121.92 metres on the Narmada Dam was over six years ago and now installation of radial gates on the dam is on, which is likely to be completed in about three years, taking its height to 138 metres.

October 6, 2014
The US Supreme Court on Monday unexpectedly  declined to hear appeals from five US states who had sought to uphold bans on same-sex marriage. The court’s ruling, which was issued with no written explanation, effectively legalized same-sex marriage in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
The gif below, compiled with data from the Human Rights Campaign , shows same-sex marriage’s spread across the US, from Massachusetts in 2004 to the now 24 states, plus the District of Columbia, where it’s already allowed (or about to be allowed, in light of today’s court ruling).
There are cases pending for another six states—Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming. Those states—as covered by the jurisdictions of the appellate courts involved in the declined appeals—would be bound by the same rulings that the Supreme Court upheld on Monday, meaning that same-sex couples in those states will likely be allowed to marry in “short order,”  the Associated Press reported .
The court did not rule on the whether banning same-sex marriage is inconsistent with the US Constitution, which applies to all 50 states. However, the move to not reverse these lower court decisions indicates that decisions to strike down same-sex marriage bans will be upheld.
The map below illustrates how the country will look if, as expected, the cases in these additional six states are upheld. That would make same-sex marriage legal in 30 of the 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia.

Here s How 3Doodler Raised $1 Million Overnight on Kickstarterreddit
We are living through the greatest resurgence of art and creative expression ever known to mankind, and I am so glad to be alive to watch it unfold.
The creative vibe that has fused with entrepreneurship in recent years has never taken place before and never on such a large scale. Just think about the things that we consume our free time with: eBooks, apps, mobile games and gadgets. These products have reinvigorated the human mind and taken us to places we've never been before, and the inventors and entrepreneurs behind these products now have the freedom and flexibility to think and create without limitations.
Ten years ago, you'd only be able to fund these business ideas with the aid of an investor or some other 3rd party entity. Thanks to the Internet, creativity and entrepreneurship has been democratized. No longer do big corporations and venture capital firms hold the keys to opportunity. Nowadays, if you have a good idea and the fortitude to execute on a business plan, it's now possible to take your product direct to the consumer and ditch the middle man. This represents a re-birth in creative freedom that not even the renaissance era could touch.
A leading example of this movement comes in the form a product called the 3Doodler . You may have heard about this neat gizmo. It was a Kickstarter project launched in February 2013. To date, it is the 24th most funded Kickstarter project of all-time. It's also worth noting that this gadget raised $1 million on Kickstarter after its first day live.
The 3Doodler is a 3D printing pen that allows your imagination to soar in any direction. Unlike a 3D printer which confines the user to a rigid architecture, the 3Doodler allows the user to literally take creative expression in the palm of their hands and move the magic pen in any direction; left; right; up or down. People of all ages and backgrounds are fans of the 3Doodler and the amount of applications this nifty pen is being used for is absolutely incredible. It's been used for home repairs, 3D art, gardening, home décor' and so much more.
Beyond the fun and creative freedom the 3Doodler provides, is a story of a team of genius inventors and entrepreneurs.
I had the opportunity to interview Daniel Cowen, co-founder of the 3Doodler, where he shared the story behind the success of the 3Doodler as well as encouraging words of wisdom for aspiring inventors, entrepreneurs and crowd funders.
What inspired the creation of the 3Doodler?
"One of the core characteristics of WobbleWorks, 3Doodler's parent company, is the desire to take an idea and make it into physical reality - whether that be a new product, process, or design.
This was the essence of our work prior to 3Doodler, when we were using 3D printers to rapidly prototype our own ideas and inventions. We frequently used our own 3D printers for that purpose. One day, 3Doodler's co-founder Pete Dilworth was watching his 3D printer printing away when it made an error. This meant there was a gap in the print, which normally means having to start from scratch again. It struck Pete that the process would be so much quicker and "freer" if he could take the item off the print platform, fill in the gap, and put it back on to finish the print. So he did just that, placing the parts of the 3D printer in a handheld form. The first iteration created was what we called "the teacup", which was an extruder with a handle (it worked horribly, but it did work).
The team then added to this, creating a unique cooling mechanism and evolving the 3Doodler to the pen-like form you see today. It's a simple idea, but one that hadn't been done before - creating a 3D printing pen. A pen is such a powerful tool; there is no quicker way to sketch out an idea, and its universal accessibility means people instinctively know how to use and manipulate them.
By placing the power of 3D creation in such a simple and accessible form, more people who previously may not have considered themselves makers, creators or even artists will become exactly that, and the 3D printing industry will continue to become more and more accessible for the everyday consumer. The birth of the 3Doodler was created out of a shortcoming in the industry, and the need to find a solution."
Why did you decide to seek funding on Kickstarter as opposed to seeking funding from investors or other more traditional sources?
"We'd all been fans of Kickstarter for some time and we have all backed several projects. There were several ways we could go to get 3Doodler off the ground, including licensing to a larger company, getting investment, or crowd funding.
After exploring all the options we had, we felt passionate enough about 3Doodler to go at it alone, and confident enough in our idea to believe that we could build a community around it. Kickstarter's reputation, screening system and user-base made them an obvious choice. It meant that we could nurture our invention with people who would develop and progress the idea with us, rather than inhibit its evolution.
The birth of the 3Doodler was only possible because we opened out our idea to the right community. Crowdfunding helped us reach unimaginable heights, and also meant that we didn't have to cede our concept to anyone else's control.
Arguably, inventions can hit a brick wall when taken under the wing of a much larger company or investor, as there can be a discrepancy between their vision and the vision of the company's founders. But in the era of crowdfunding, anything is possible for people who have ideas and motivation, but lack the right resources. Backers are out there waiting for you; and can not only financially support your project, but become an integral part of it.
We have gained so much from working with Kickstarter and our backers, and it's allowed us to build a product, a community, and a longer-term business. It provided proof of concept and marketability much earlier than would have traditionally been the case."
Many crowdfunding campaigns have difficulty gaining traction. Did you do any marketing or promotion to draw more traffic to your campaign?
"We had an overall idea of what we wanted to achieve and we prepared for over three months in anticipation of launch. This included giving press and bloggers a heads up early on, and carefully planning out what we would do if launch didn't go as hoped. We got into the fine details of what we'd do on social, how we'd use our updates to spur momentum, and even had some fun stunts planned mid-campaign. When things took off at the pace they did most of those plans fell by the wayside (largely due to lack of time and a change of focus), but the planning still helped a lot and some of those ideas came back to life later on. There were staples that we stuck to though, for example our work with some of the fantastic wire-artists on Etsy - that really helped frame for people what the 3Doodler could be used for and gave them a strong reference point.
And we're also lucky enough to have had enough people behind the project to create buzz and excitement. Reaching out to people early is always a great way of getting people on your side ahead of launch!"

5 Midwest Cities on the Entrepreneurial Risereddit
Think Silicon Valley is the only place to launch a successful tech startup?
Maybe you haven't visited some of the growing cities in the so-called flyover states. As a founder born and raised in Indiana, I've kept an eye on what's growing outside of the coasts. Abundant resources and midwestern work ethic have sprouted entrepreneurial communities and startups that are changing the status quo .
Check out how these 5 Midwest cities are creating a fertile landscape for startups:
Madison, Wisconsin
Despite being home to a Big Ten foe - Go Hoosiers! - Madison plays host to a great tech scene built on the foundation of two big players, Sonic Foundry and Raven Software. Madison is also big into the coworking scene, with locations like madworks coworking combining the power of entrepreneurship with resources from The University of Wisconsin-Madison. You'll also find groups like gener8tor Investment Group and other members of this list of Madison startups .
Minneapolis, Minnesota
Despite its brutal winters, the land of 10,000 lakes is home to a thriving startup culture. An entrepreneurial culture shouldn't be a surprise in a city that also plays host to the world headquarters for Best Buy and Target. According to tech.mn, there are over 150 startups in Minneapolis and they have a talent pool deeper than Lake Superior. I can't wait to meet some of the talented entrepreneurs working out of WorkAround and CoCo.
Des Moines, Iowa
There's a reason Forbes called Des Moines one of the top places for business and careers in 2012. Part of this comes from factors that are true throughout the Midwest - low cost of living, work ethic, large talent pool - but one big advantage for Des Moines are their Economic Development Organizations. The Greater Des Moines Partnership and Iowa Economic Development Authority have done an incredible job of supporting their community's entrepreneurs and growing startups .
Kansas City, MO
Kansas City is home to the Kansas City Startup Village . This is an exciting organization dedicated to fostering the education of entrepreneurs and increasing the number of opportunities for startups to succeed through programming, recruitment and knowledge sharing. KC has also done a great job of fostering community support for the startups that call their city home, including this list of Kansas City Startups .
St. Louis, Missouri
Thanks to Square Co-Founder, Jim McKelvey, St. Louis is primed to be a tech hot spot. McKelvey is a man on a mission to build the Missouri city into a mecca of tech. He has launched a program called LaunchCode and continues to shovel money and mentorship into St. Louis. At the same time, The Partnership for Downtown St. Louis, The Regional Chamber and City of St. Louis came together and created a massive, 80,000-square-foot startup space named T-REX. More than just a space, T-REX provides resources, creates programming, and accelerates growth for St. Louis startups.
This October 6-10, I'll join Steve Case , former CEO of AOL to visit all five of these cities and their entrepreneurial hotspots. Case will be investing $100,000 in one startup in each of these five cities, only reiterating the fact that opportunity is abundant in the Midwest--not only for entrepreneurs, but investors too.
We're celebrating entrepreneurship across America on this Rise of the Rest tour. It's an opportunity to witness what Midwest startup communities are building.
I'm really excited about the caliber of talent I'll meet on this tour, and I'm going to be working my butt off over the next few weeks to find lessons learned from throughout the Midwest and share them with you.
What questions do you have about the Midwest entrepreneurial landscape? What do you want to know from Steve Case?

Its Not All Doom and Gloom: What We Can Do Now for the Arcticreddit
Last week I was in New York, where policy makers and the public alike spoke out about climate change. None of us are strangers to the realities of climate change -- steadily climbing temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, melting ice and rising sea levels. However, fewer people are aware of how they can help to tackle the problem.
While we often think about the effect of climate change on our lives and on the land we inhabit, it's also important to focus on the blue spaces that make up so much of the Earth.
The ocean covers two thirds of the planet, produces almost half of all the oxygen we breathe and sequesters more than a quarter of the CO2 we emit into the atmosphere. It is, in essence, the kidneys of our planet, keeping systems healthy, giving life -- and there is no way to put it on dialysis.
The ability of this life system to continue to provide these essential ecosystem services is being compromised. As rising temperatures reduce the oxygen carrying capacity of the ocean and the amount of CO2 being absorbed causes acidification , marine organisms and ecosystems are suffering. Habitats are being destroyed, fish stocks are over exploited and marine predators are becoming extinct at an alarming rate.
In the Arctic, the problem is particularly clear: it's melting. Beyond the four million people living there who are affected every day by rising temperatures, we all face the consequences of the changes in the Arctic. Extreme weather, rising sea levels and food insecurity, particularly in the most impoverished parts of the world, are all growing problems. As the ice is melting, a new ocean is being born -- one that some may try to exploit through fishing and oil and gas drilling, which is fraught with uncertainty and has the potential for devastating harm.
So where do we go from here? There is an extraordinary opportunity to rescue this new ocean, 'refreeze' what we can by establishing structures to protect this beautiful place before it's even fully born and understood. Just as a healthy body is more resilient to disease, a healthy ocean is more resilient to harmful change.
The International Declaration on the Future of the Arctic is a charter for Arctic protection being spearheaded by our friends at Greenpeace. I have signed the declaration and look forward to working with the leaders of the Arctic States and representatives from the United Nations to ensure that the Arctic is fully protected before it's too late.
In this time where we feel paralyzed by messages of doom and gloom, let's remember that we can change things. We can make a difference and we have a responsibility to future generations to ensure that our actions today don't destroy their future.
Millions have already declared their support for protecting the Arctic. Join us - sign the pledge here .
This post is part of a month-long series produced by The Huffington Post in conjunction with a variety of events being held in September recognizing the threats posed by climate change. Those events include the UN's Climate Summit 2014 (that was held Sept. 23, 2014, at UN headquarters in New York) and Climate Week NYC (Sept. 22-28, 2014, throughout New York City).

Unemployment Rate Falls To 6-Year Lowreddit
The job-market recovery from the Great Recession has been frustratingly slow, but it has been steady -- the steadiest job recovery in U.S. history, in fact.
President Obama is chided on the right and the left for the anemic recovery, but he can counter that it has at least been grinding slowly in the right direction. Unfortunately, some of the negative features of the recovery -- flat wages and people dropping out of the labor force -- have been just as persistent.
U.S. employers added 248,000 new jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday, marking the 48th straight month of job growth. That ties the longest stretch since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping track in 1939. The only other uninterrupted four-year run came during the Reagan administration in 1986-1990.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.9 percent from 6.1, the first time unemployment has been below 6 percent since July 2008 before the financial crisis. The drop in unemployment, too, has been stunningly steady:
In one downside to Friday's report, 97,000 people dropped out of the labor force, the pool of Americans either working or looking for work. Because you can't be officially "unemployed" if you're not looking for work, having a bunch of people give up looking for work makes the unemployment rate lower.
That has been another consistent feature of this recovery, unfortunately: Unemployment has come down partly because people are dropping out of the labor force.
The percentage of working-age Americans in the labor force dipped to 62.7 percent in September, the lowest since February 1978. A lot of the Americans leaving the labor force are Baby Boomers retiring , but many are people who have simply given up hope of finding a good job.
Recent reports suggest they might have reason to start hoping eventually. Employers have added 226,000 jobs per month, on average, this year -- a healthy pace that more than keeps up with natural population growth.
In another downside to the report that sounds all too familiar, wage growth continued to disappoint in September. Average hourly earnings ticked down by a penny to $24.53 and are up just 2 percent in the past year, barely keeping up with inflation.
Most of the new jobs in this recovery have been low-wage jobs . Wages have been basically stagnant for several decades , in fact, while the incomes of the top 1 percent have soared.

Call money rates shoot up due to bank holidaysCall money rates shoot up due to bank holidays
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 04, 2014 09:35 PM IST
Following two consecutive bank holidays, the call money rate rose about 75 basis points on Saturday, as lenders rushed to borrow from the overnight market to meet their reserve needs ahead of another two consecutive days of market holiday. Clearing Corporation of India data showed during intra-day trade, the rate touched a high of 8.5, after opening at eight per cent.
In recent times, the call money rate has been around the repo rate, which is eight per cent.
According to data, the weighted average rate stood at 7.88 per cent on Wednesday and, during intra-day trade on that day, it had touched a high of 8.1 per cent, against 8.15 per cent on Saturday.
Banks have to adhere to a cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement of 95 per cent daily, including on Saturdays, and 100 per cent on a fortnightly basis. CRR is the proportion of total deposits a bank has to keep with RBI as cash. Currently, it stands at four per cent of banks’ net demand and time liabilities (NDTL).
“Some stability in the rates might be seen from Tuesday. Not much volatility in rates is expected this festive season,” said the head of treasury of a state-run bank.
Typically, liquidity tightens in the festive season, as currency in circulation increases. However, this time, it might be different because from last month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put in place a revised framework for liquidity management. Under this framework, RBI conducts more frequent term repos; it might also carry out overnight variable rate repo auctions, depending on the liquidity conditions. This is aimed at helping banks address liquidity issues better.
Before this framework was in place, the call money rate had risen to more than nine per cent.
Bankers find it difficult to adhere to CRR requirements on Saturdays, as RBI does not conduct daily liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) operations on these days. Some lenders, including State Bank of India, have urged the central bank to open the LAF window on Saturdays, too.
A senior public sector bank official, however, said, “RBI doesn’t want money market operations on Saturdays; as the LAF window is not there on Saturdays, it becomes difficult for us to manage liquidity needs. We suggested in such a case, even real-time gross settlement and national electronic fund transfers shouldn’t be there on Saturdays. But RBI didn’t agree to this,” he added.
Overnight borrowing from the repo window is capped at 0.25 per cent of banks’ NDTL. Banks can borrow from the term-repo window at 0.75 per cent of NDTL.

Taking ties beyond the BeltwayUpdated: October 6, 2014 00:37 IST
Taking ties beyond the Beltway
Jayant Prasad
heads of state
Narendra Modi’s U.S. visit has restored a degree of confidence to a neglected relationship, preparing the ground for a lift to bilateral ties, while ensuring that India and the U.S. get on with operationalising what they can from their multilayered agenda
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States has to be measured against the principal challenge he faced: how to engage with an already preoccupied partner.
He overcame this challenge by interacting with a much broader American audience than any of his predecessors. A very special feature of his visit was his determination to open new doors in the U.S. and take the relationship beyond the beltway in Washington DC. All previous Summit level U.S. visits by Indian leaders featured a mandatory speech at a think tank, interaction with a few Congressional leaders, and a meeting each with businessmen and the Indian community. The public diplomacy effort this time included multiple energetic exchanges with business and industry leaders, the Indian-American community, and U.S. lawmakers, surpassing all previous efforts.
U.S President Barack Obama commented about Mr. Modi’s “rock-star performance” at the Madison Square Garden arena. Far from being just a “tamasha,” the spectacle mobilised the Indian community across the U.S. and imparted to them a sense of pride and hope. Several Congressmen and Senators were present at the event, including some who have been critical of India on IT visas and compulsory licensing. These lawmakers saw at first hand the size, scale and connectedness of the Indian-American community to India, as also Mr. Modi’s crowd-pulling power. The message that this community is now a force whose expectations cannot be ignored, including for better India-U.S. ties, is a positive asset.
Future contours
While engaging new audiences, Mr. Modi did not ignore his host, with whom he established an excellent entente, overcoming the negative overhang of visa-denial since 2002. Moreover, he did not use the visit for inventorying deliverables, but to convey to all his interlocutors, within and outside the U.S. government, India’s aspirations for the future contours of the relationship. Much of this is encapsulated within the Joint Statement, the joint editorial by the two leaders published on the website of The Washington Post, and the Vision Statement of the India-U.S. Strategic Partnership — cleverly captioned by a new “mantra”: “Chalein Saath Saath: Forward together we go.” Such a vision could help in taking steps towards its progressive concretion.
This visit has gone some way in changing the atmospherics of the bilateral relationship. It has convinced many in the U.S. strategic decision-making community of India’s commitment to forge an enduring partnership with the U.S., as also India’s ability to think on a big scale about its own global role, in which India-U.S. ties could find a new energy.
The American context
Believing his predecessor had overexposed the U.S. globally, Mr. Obama has tried recalibrating foreign policy, with diminished dependence on military power. The 2008 U.S. National Intelligence Council (NIC) report announced a multipolar world and predicted that U.S. power was fated to wane. This coincided with the 2008 economic slowdown. Mr. Obama’s principal policy imperative has been to rebalance U.S. foreign and security policy in order to guide the U.S. towards graceful decline.
Three main initiatives of Mr. Obama — outstretched hand to Iran, strategic reassurance to China, and reset for Russia — each foundered. These also involved downplaying relations with traditional and prospective partners, including serious neglect of India in the early part of the Obama presidency. Other challenges to U.S. diplomacy have multiplied manifold since then.
The National Security Agency (NSA) revelations hurt U.S. credibility with its partners. Long-established U.S. ascendancy in the China-Russia-U.S. triangular relationship passed to China. Mr. Obama announced the strategic defeat of al-Qaeda, the same way Mr. George W. Bush had announced success in Iraq, but the rise of the Islamic State shows that Islamists are arguably stronger and more spread out than at any other time in history. Relative neglect, fear of over-commitment, and waging the wrong wars with the wrong local partners have led to the crises in Iraq and Syria and the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan. With added tensions in Ukraine and the East and South China Seas, the environment for rebuilding India-U.S. relations has become even more complex.
Mr. Obama has concentrated more power in his hands than any other American President, making him one of the most centralising Presidents ever. His successive National Security Advisors, James Jones, Tom Donilon and Susan Rice, did not have independent opinions. Only Mr. Donilon among them had a sense of the strategic nature of India-U.S. relations, in which none of the NSAs was invested. Indians reciprocated with similar laissez-faire. Mr. Obama’s visit to India in November 2010, when he welcomed “India’s emergence as a major regional and global power” and affirmed U.S. interest in “India’s rise, its economic prosperity, and its security,” did not lead to an upgraded relationship. Indeed, there was a marked regression since then.
The unfinished agenda
Is good chemistry between the two leaders cause to celebrate? Not by itself. The divergences in outlook that come from the geostrategic placement of India and the U.S., their historic and social evolution, and economic asymmetry do not make it easy to work together.
Moreover, tending the full spectrum relationship between them, spanning counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, defence, energy, entertainment, education, finance, science and technology, trade and tourism, besides guidance from the leadership, requires considerable investment of time and skills, conspicuous by its absence.
What India and the U.S. need to do together is clear; they simply have been unable to do it. The areas of strategic convergence are known. A growing, pluralistic and democratic India is a constructive force in Asia and the world. India needs U.S. investments and technology. The U.S. needs Indian markets and skilled service providers. The gap between promise and performance of the two countries lies in the mutual timidity of their governments in treading the path signposted after considerable effort. Roadblocks need to be removed by resolving differences, for which both sides must sit and talk.
The renewal of the 2005 Framework for the India-U.S. Defense Relationship is a reminder that in the 10 years of its operation, nothing whatsoever was done to “increase opportunities for technology transfer, collaboration, co-production, and research and development.” India’s contingent and reactive defence policy, including on procurement, compromises security and is a drain on national resources. India has stepped up buying of U.S. weapons; but has not so far co-developed or built them.
Similarly, the absence of energetic pursuit of U.S. support for “a reformed UN Security Council with India as a permanent member,” and the U.S. resolve “to continue work towards India’s phased entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Australia Group” — almost exactly the same words used when Mr. Obama had visited India in 2010 — persuade many Indians that inaction on these commitments might be a sign of equivocation.
Mr. Modi was well briefed in addressing areas of contention, including climate change and World Trade Organization (WTO) issues, indeed, a range of bread-and-butter issues of concern to both countries on which equitable solutions must be explored. In his self-confident interactions on these, he showed his hand on what gives and what does not.
On agricultural subsidies, he put across that a large and populous country like India needs flexibility to take care of food security, rural employment, and livelihood concerns through continued domestic support. At the joint press briefing with Mr. Obama, he made public advocacy for “continued openness and ease of access for Indian services companies in the U.S. market.”
A contact group was set up for the full implementation of the India-U.S. civil nuclear cooperation agreement, as also an annual high-level Intellectual Property (IP) Working Group, with an “appropriate decision-making” mandate as part of the Trade Policy Forum. Mr. Modi deflected pressure to give up on India’s pro-public health patent protection policy that enables the supply of high-quality, life-saving medicines worldwide. When pharma sector CEOs spoke of their apprehensions about India’s intellectual property rights (IPR) regime, he reportedly told them that India needed affordable medicines, and that their firms needed to “devote the right energy” to R&D for new drug development, “not just by changing the formulation of a drug to sustain a patent, but by inventing things that make a difference to mankind.”
Looking ahead
At the very least, this visit restored a degree of confidence to a neglected relationship. It has prepared the ground for a lift to bilateral ties, while ensuring in the meanwhile that India and the U.S. get on with operationalising what they can from our multilayered agenda, bridging differences on managing the global commons, resolving bilateral roadblocks on commercial exchanges and investments, building cooperation in science and technology and defence production, and forging a closer strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific region.
Notwithstanding shared values and interests, the real traction in India-U.S. relations lies ahead, perhaps with a new U.S. President just over two years away, as India begins to realise its economic potential and augments all aspects of what the Chinese describe as comprehensive national power.

Investor wealth zooms over Rs 23 lakh crore so far this yearInvestor wealth zooms over Rs 23 lakh crore so far this year
PTI Oct 6, 2014, 04.26PM IST
(At present, the total market…)
MUMBAI: Stock market investors have become richer by over Rs 23.33 lakh crore so far this year, as 25.49 per cent rally in the benchmark Sensex has helped the total valuation of all the BSE listed firms reach close to Rs 94 lakh crore.
In contrast, investors' wealth had surged by over Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 70,44,431 crore in 2013.
At present, the total market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE listed companies stands at Rs 93,77,672 crore, about Rs 6.22 lakh short of the Rs 100 lakh crore milestone.
The Sensex has gained 25.49 per cent from December 31 to October 1 and touched its life-time high of 27,319.85 on September 8.
Positive investor sentiment following the formation of new government at the Centre and strong foreign fund inflows have been driving the domestic equity markets, experts said.
"The undercurrent of the stock market is bullish although stocks are currently in the consolidation phase and buying may resume in the days to come," said an equities expert.
Marketmen have maintained that the surge in investor wealth is also due to continued rise in listed firms. The total number of listed companies stands at 5,485.
Sensex blue-chip companies whose market valuation is more than Rs 1 lakh crore include TCS, ONGC, RIL, ITC, Infosys, Coal India, HDFC Bank, SBI, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Bharti Airtel, HUL, Wipro, Tata Motors, L&T and NTPC.
Outsourcing giant TCS is the most valued Indian company with a market cap of Rs 5,43,684.13 crore.
Indian markets have seen smart gains this year helped by robust foreign fund inflows.
Since the beginning of this year, foreign investors have infused a net of Rs 83,438 crore ($14 billion) in the stock markets, while they have invested a net of Rs 1.18 lakh crore into the debt market ($19.6 billion).

Good People Don t Get Good Jobsreddit
When Mary Grace Gainer anxiously told her master’s and doctoral advisors that she’d noticed want ads for college professors diminishing, they assured her, “Good people get good jobs.”
So she focused on being very, very good. She earned straight A’s. She presented papers at academic conferences, including at Princeton. She sweated over her instructional duties, earning rave reviews from her students. She served as an officer for academic organizations and helped plan educational events.
But then, to her horror, with $90,000 in student debt and a family to support, she discovered good people don’t always get good jobs. Against her will and her efforts, Gainer joined the world’s growing ranks of marginalized workers. They live precariously, without health insurance, without a living wage, without a schedule for duty, without a guarantee of work the next week or month. 
Mary Grace Gainer with her mother after doctoral ceremonies.
This mounting army of workers worries incessantly and survives only because of government and family assistance. CEOs and corporations gorge themselves on profits made on the suffering of workers trapped in this life of frightening instability called the precariat.
To reverse this dangerous trend, the International Trade Union Confederation created the World Day for Decent Work six years ago. On Oct. 7 this year, my union, the United Steelworkers (USW), as well as the IndustriALL Global Union, representing 50 million workers in 140 countries, and others around the world will demonstrate against this corporate scheme. 
Mary Grace Gainer will be among those protesting. When this woman with a PhD in English discovered in February that she was pregnant, she no longer had health insurance and was unsure where she would get her next paychecks, even after years of teaching full-time at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
IUP’s English Department had cut her classes, and thus her pay and benefits, to the point where her two children qualified for the state-subsidized child health insurance program. The university did the same to a dozen other professors who had hoped, like Gainer, to soon be on the tenure track. Her partner, a military veteran, had struggled to find work until ultimately he secured a job driving a school bus for $57 a day, but no benefits. Her wages dramatically reduced, Gainer could not afford health insurance for herself.
As a result, Gainer was living without stability, like millions of restaurant and retail workers around the country. The New York Times this year has repeatedly documented the plight of these workers.
They can’t arrange childcare because the corporations employing them don’t post schedules until the last minute. They’re late paying rent because these corporations order them to leave work early during slow periods, slashing wages. They go to work ill, even at restaurants, because the corporations refuse to provide paid sick time off. They can’t see a doctor anyway because the corporations keep them at just below the number of hours per week that would qualify them for health benefits.
Shoving workers into the precariat like this is the manifestation of corporate greed. That’s clear because some retailers and restaurants including Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and Modell’s Sporting Goods stores in Manhattan make profits while treating workers fairly. In many of these cases, the workers are represented by unions that bargain for better conditions. That includes schedules posted weeks in advance, full-time work, vacation and sick pay and health insurance coverage.
Collective bargaining gives union workers more power to resist attempts by corporations to impose insecurity. Still, corporations like Rio Tinto try.
The world’s third-largest mining company demanded in 2012 that the 780 union workers at the Alma, Quebec, aluminum smelter allow Rio Tinto to replace retirees with new hires who would be denied membership in the USW, who would receive half pay, and who would get substandard benefits.  When the union refused, Rio Tinto locked the workers out. It took six months, but Rio Tinto finally backed off.
As individuals, workers would not win such a fight. Mary Grace Gainer knows that. And that’s why she supported the ultimately successful effort by Point Park University adjunct professors to be represented by the USW’s Adjunct Faculty Association.
When Gainer finished her PhD and taught full-time at IUP, she earned $55,000 a year, as well as full health and retirement benefits. She had to apply for this position every year, but after five consecutive full-time years, she could have sought a tenure track position, providing more job security. But IUP prevented Gainer and a dozen colleagues from getting that far.
Suddenly, in the summer of 2013, IUP’s English Department told them it would no longer assign them full teaching schedules. They would be replaced with students studying for advanced degrees.
Gainer then sought work as an adjunct professor at Point Park. Adjuncts are hired to teach a course or two, a semester at a time. Point Park told her it would pay $2,244 a semester for each class. With preparation and instruction time, grading, and meetings with students, adjuncts figure that’s less than minimum wage -- for workers with master’s and doctorate degrees. They get no benefits. They don’t know from semester to semester how many courses, or which courses, universities will assign them to teach.
While raising tuition at more than twice the rate of inflation, colleges and universities are subjecting more and more teachers to precarious lives. Now, three-quarters of university instructors are underpaid adjuncts.
Gainer feels university officials misled her about what would be possible if she got her PhD. “You do everything right and you think you are going to make it, and you don’t,” she said.
Pressing people into the precariat can’t continue, she said. “People are really, really hurting. People can’t live like this. I think it is going to collapse in some way. I see nurses and teachers and fast food workers going out on strike and unionizing. I hope we are on the track to taking the economy back somewhat from the mess it has become.”
Guy Standing, a professor at the University of London who has authored two books about precarious work, wrote recently that workers will rise up to oppose the economic forces condemning families to insecurity as they recognize “that their situation is not due to personal failings.”
Those who know it’s not their fault that good people don’t get good jobs will demonstrate on World Day for Decent Work. USW members employed at Rio Tinto facilities in Alma, Labrador and Utah, adjuncts like Gainer, workers in the precariat and their sympathizers worldwide will demand justice.

Mary G. Gainer is looking for a job around Indiana, Pa., that would enable her to use the writing and teaching skills she developed studying for her doctorate in English and take her family out of the precariat. Here is her professional information on LinkedIn .

Burger King Undercuts Chicken Nuggets Pricingreddit
Burger King today is slashing the price for a 10-piece serving of its Chicken Nuggets to $1.49, dealing a double blow to McDonald's, where Chicken McNuggets carry Monopoly game pieces and where "core products" such as McNuggets have been a marketing focus.
The limited-time offer cuts the price for Burger King's Nuggets to nearly one-third the $4.29 price for 10 Chicken McNuggets. McDonald's Dollar Menu & More offers a 20-piece McNuggets for $5, but Burger King now offers that many for just under $3.
Packaging for the 10-piece Chicken McNuggets has two game pieces for McDonald's recently relaunched Monopoly promotion. The 20-piece McNuggets box has four game pieces. Burger King is betting that consumers will opt to save money rather than try to collect all four railroad pieces once again.
Burger King makes it clear this price cut is a competitive tactic as well as an effort to provide consumers with value. "With the growing consumer demand for chicken menu items, we wanted to offer our guests an aggressive deal rivaling anything our competition has ever done," Eric Hirschhorn, Chief Marketing Officer, North America, says in a release announcing the price reduction.
During the July 22 Q2 conference call with analysts, McDonald's President-CEO Don Thompson emphasized that the chain's rebound depends on traditional products such as McNuggets and Big Macs as well as new menu items. "We need to see baseline improvements in all core products as well as a boost over the baseline based upon the new products that we implement," Thompson said.
Burger King is having fun tormenting McDonald's Monopoly game. As reported here earlier, in Australia, where it operates as Hungry Jack's, Burger King advertised that it would honor Monopoly food-prize winners.
Chicken McNuggets have been an important, iconic menu item for McDonald's since their introduction nationally in 1983. The chain has fooled with them very little since, although this summer it tested Shakin' Flavor Chicken McNuggets. Like the Shakin' Flavor Fries it also has tried, the McNuggets test served them in a bag for shaking with Spicy Buffalo, Garlic Parmesan or Zesty Ranch flavorings.

New Manufacturing Jobsreddit
The economy continues to grow, albeit at a lackluster pace, and the manufacturing sector as in the past is the primary engine of growth. Manufacturing also is producing many new jobs -- 647,000 since 2010. They are not as numerous as the low-skill manufacturing jobs of earlier generations, but they are better jobs that offer greater opportunity and reward and there are many more out there than people think.
The new manufacturing is eroding the traditional barrier between services and manufacturing. A growing number of people working in manufacturing today are performing jobs that could be considered service positions, but actually bridge the gap.
The new manufacturing jobs are significantly different from the rote assembly line work of earlier generations. The new manufacturing is built upon advanced technologies and demands more advanced skills from workers. They must be able to grasp engineering concepts, work with computers, make mathematical calculations and adapt to constant change. A manufacturing worker today must have the equivalent of two years of college, or more.
Not surprisingly, we have serious shortages of critical skills needed in manufacturing which is to be expected in an era of rapid change The National Association of Manufacturers is working with EverFi to support introduction of more sophisticated training materials on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) into K-12 schools. The Manufacturing Institute's Dream It, Do It program is steering many bright young people into manufacturing careers. Likewise, a growing number of firms are developing new apprenticeship programs to prepare young people for promising opportunities in the new manufacturing. And of course rising compensation will play a part in closing the skills gap.
I see a rich mother lode of career opportunities emerging in these four key areas:
Energy -- serving the entire spectrum of our energy boom from natural gas and oil to solar panels and wind turbines. We are becoming energy independent at long last, and it promises to be a rich mother lode of career opportunities
The automobile industry is growing about 20 percent a year and is more reliant than ever on automation, robots and advanced materials.
Aerospace and transportation are seeing large job growth, and this field is obviously highly reliant on advanced technologies.
Medical care has emerged as one of the biggest sectors of our economy. Technical jobs handling new medical devices are providing excellent career opportunities to millions.
This is the wave of the future. Manufacturing has always been the seedbed of innovation and is uniquely qualified to take advantage of the rapid progress in technology. It is only logical that manufacturing will be the driver of economic progress in the years ahead -- and become once again a major source of new jobs, albeit jobs that demand a higher skill set than in earlier years.

Donald Trumps takes name off casinoThe Donald wins. Trump name coming off casino
By Aaron Smith   @AaronSmithCNN October 6, 2014: 1:32 PM ET
The Donald sued and won, forcing this Atlantic City casino to peel his name from its marquee.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The Donald got his way, and is peeling his name off the façade of the defunct Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
"We have a very high standard and they didn't meet it," Donald Trump said, in an interview to CNNMoney. "We essentially won the suit."
It's a success for Trump (the man, not the casino) who sued Trump Entertainment Resorts, the company that runs Trump Plaza Casino . The real estate mogul wanted his name removed from two of the Atlantic City casinos: Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal.
"The process of removing the letters from the building is beginning today and the project should take a few weeks," said Brian Cahill, spokesman for Trump Entertainment Resorts.
Related: Trump Plaza files for bankruptcy
The Taj Mahal is expected to close down on Nov. 13, or shortly thereafter.
Trump originally built and owned both the casinos, before selling them seven years ago. He has since been licensing his name and image to the company that bought the casinos.
Trump's lawsuit, filed in August, accused the company of neglecting the casinos and allowing them "to fall into an utter state of disrepair." The neglect violated the license agreement, under which the brand's "superior reputation" must be used in a "dignified manner" consistent with the "highest quality."
Related: Revel sold at bankruptcy auction
Trump Plaza went out of business in September, becoming the fourth casino in Atlantic City to shut down this year, putting 8,000 people out of work.
One of the shut-down casinos - Revel - was sold at bankruptcy auction for $110 million on Oct. 1 to Brookfield Asset Management.
"Atlantic City needs a total remake," said Trump.

Burger King undercuts McDonald's on chicken nugget prices
Burger King Worldwide is lowering its chicken nugget prices to 15 cents each as fast-food chains compete to lure budget-minded customers.
A 10-piece chicken nugget order will cost $1.49 beginning Monday for a limited time in the U.S., the company said in a statement. Miami-based Burger King regularly sells the nuggets for $2.99.
Cash strapped Americans? Has anyone seen the crowds at reguler restaurants, even during the week? Maybe they are searching for healthier foods choices and moving away from that type of eating establishment with plastic seating areas.
ch47fixer

Fast-food restaurants are trying to draw cash-strapped Americans with new and discounted fare as younger diners increasingly flock to fast-casual chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill. McDonald's is selling 20 chicken McNuggets for $5, or 25 cents apiece, as well as a $2 jalapeno burger. Burger King has recently offered a two-sandwiches-for-$5 deal.
“There is a certain group of customers that are extraordinarily price-sensitive,” said John Gordon, principal at Pacific Management Consulting Group, an adviser to restaurants and franchisees, in San Diego. “Hopefully you can keep those customers coming back -- the problem being that customers that are so motivated by very low-price items aren't very loyal.”
Burger King is struggling to boost same-store sales in the U.S. and Canada. They rose 0.4 percent in that region in the second quarter. McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, has seen a domestic sales slump recently. Sales at McDonald's U.S. locations open at least 13 months fell 2.8 percent in August, the fourth straight monthly decline.
While the cheap nuggets may help Burger King boost traffic, franchisees probably are unhappy with the extremely low price, Gordon said. The discounted 10-pack is “low margin,” he said.
Burger King has about 7,370 stores in the U.S. and Canada and about 99 percent of them are owned by franchisees.

Sohini Das | Ahmedabad Oct 06, 2014 08:59 PM IST
With prices of skimmed milk powder (SMP) dipping by almost 40 per cent in the last few quarters, domestic dairy majors feel that exports would dip significantly this fiscal. The country's largest dairy cooperative, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) says that its exports could be down by almost 50 per cent, while Karnataka's Nandini has not done much exports this year.
GCMMF, which sells milk and milk products under the Amul brand, had registered a three-fold rise in its exports in value terms last fiscal to Rs 530 crore, exporting nearly 20,000 tonnes. This year, however, as R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF pointed out, "Powder exports would be very less this year as the international prices are down by almost 40 per cent. Our exports could be down by almost 50 per cent."
Prices of SMP are hovering around Rs 170-180 a kg now in the international market, down from Rs 220 a kg around three months back. Domestic prices are better, say dairy players, around Rs 200-220 a kg now. "However, the international scenario has also impacted the domestic prices, which are down from Rs 250-260 around three months back," said a senior official at the Karnataka Milk Federation (which owns the Nandini brand).
The international prices are down primarily due to oversupply. As R G chandramogan, managing director of Hatsun Agro Private Ltd, one of the major private dairy players down South explained, "Eastern Europe is in a position to give more milk, the milk quota in the EU would be abolished in 2015, plus higher procurement prices have also ensured better supplies. For example, New Zealand has increased its production. All these factors have contributed to a demand-supply mismatch."
According to the milk quota or dairy produce quota, each EU member state has a national quota which it distributes to its farmers, and whenever a state exceeds its quota, it has to pay a penalty to the EU. With this system abolished, easily 25-30 per cent more milk is expected in the market, further bringing down international prices, feel industry insiders.
Indian dairy majors are therefore focussing more on the domestic market. Chandramogan said that, "We have been anticipating this for a while now, and hence had already increased our focus on increasing branded products sales in India. We will not be a major exporter this year." The company had exported 12,000 tonnes of SMP in 2012-13, bringing that down to 4,500 tonnes in 2013-14, and this year isn't expecting much of exports at all. Instead, it has also brought down the sale of milk as a commodity in the dairy market. Around two years back, nearly 20 per cent of its business was as commodity, which is down to just about 4 per cent now. It has increased the share of branded dairy products to retail customers.
KMF too is keeping itself busy with supplying more milk into the domestic market. "We are implementing a school milk programme this year, according to which nearly 10 million children in Karnataka would get around 150 ml of milk every day. This takes up around six to seven lakh litres of milk every day, and hence, we are not hard-pressed for exports," said a source in the federation.
Amul's Sodhi, however, reasoned that it is eyeing new export markets like Russia, which has recently opened up to Indian dairy exports.
"Russia is a milk deficit country, and import nearly 3-4 lakh tonne every year. We are waiting for their regulatory officials to visit our manufacturing plants and approve them, so that we can start exporting to that country," he said adding that the process is likely to be completed by December.
A dairy analyst pointed out that thanks to high milk inflation, India is hardly competitive for dairy exports. "Only when the international prices are at their peak, we can export, otherwise, we are not very price competitive as such," he said. According to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda), India1,59,228.52 tonnes of dairy products to the world for the worth of Rs 3,318.53 crores during the year 2013-14.

No gloves  no masks: Dallas officials send a message of calm about Ebola riskBy Abby Phillip October 6 Follow @abbydphillip

DALLAS — Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins pulled into the Ivy Apartments community late in the evening Friday wearing suit pants and a lavender dress shirt.
There were hazardous materials trucks all around, as cleaning crews had arrived to remove materials that might have been touched by Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who is hospitalized in Texas with Ebola. The hazmat workers were covered from head to toe in bright yellow body suits, green gloves and breathing masks.
Jenkins walked into the apartment in building No. 6 to greet Louise Troh, her family and others who live with her and had been court-ordered to stay in their home because they were considered high risk after coming into contact with Duncan.
It was time to move, and Troh, her 13-year old son, a relative of Duncan's and another man — all of whom lived in the apartment — got into the judge's car for the 45-minute drive to their new, temporary home, in an undisclosed part of Dallas.
Jenkins, the judge, never covered up.
“I’m a married man with a little girl,” Jenkins told reporters later that night. “I’m wearing the same shirt I was when I was in the car with that family.
“I was in their house next to those materials, meeting with them, listening to them, and assuring them last night and again of course today. If there were any risk, I would not expose myself or my family to that risk.”
He added: “There is zero risk."
In the face of widespread fear — and in some cases misinformation — about Ebola following the first diagnosis of the virus in the United States, Dallas officials have taken a notable visual approach to make the point that, at least right now, the city is safe.

On a daily basis, workers monitoring the temperatures and health of as many as nine individuals who they believe might have had direct contact with Duncan have entered those people's homes with no gloves, no masks and no personal protective equipment whatsoever.
And city officials including Jenkins, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings and Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Zachary Thompson have interacted with the family no differently that they might have if the four people who are in a state of semi-isolation had been suspected of having come into contact with somebody sick with the flu.
“Based on our assessment, they were asymptomatic; therefore, I didn't feel they posed any threat to me,” Thompson said in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday. "There is a standard procedure for when they should be using the PPE’s (personal protective equipment). In this case we knew our nurses, our staff, had assessed that they were asymptomatic."
So far, none of the people who have potentially had contact with Duncan are showing any symptoms, Thompson said.
Yet concern and stigma are widespread in Dallas.
Photographs from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea — where the epidemic is spiraling out of control  — frequently show fully masked health workers carrying infected people to hospitals or burial sites. Those images have become closely associated with the virus and the outbreak in the public's mind.
And for one day, similar images briefly appeared in Dallas as cleaning crews removed materials from Troh's apartment that might have come into contact with the virus.

The decision for the crew to wear personal protective equipment was made by the company, the "Cleaning Guys," according to Dallas officials.
"We train for this type of thing,” company executive Brad Smith told ABC News. “Obviously, we haven't trained for Ebola because there hasn't been a situation in Texas until now."
The Ebola virus is not very hearty outside of the human body.
Still, touching and destroying potentially infected materials is far different from speaking to or being in the same room with people who might have been exposed to the virus.
And public health expert Gavin Macgregor-Skinner, who worked in Nigeria to end that country’s outbreak , said that treating people with a sense of humanity and not feeding hysteria is critical to managing the Dallas Ebola case and others that might occur around the world.
“Even in West Africa when we do contact tracing, we don’t put on personal protective equipment,” said Macgregor-Skinner, an assistant professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. “We have the six-feet rule: We stay about six feet away from people and I can interview them and I can make them feel like people.
“If they have no symptoms, we need to make them feel normal, like they’re part of the community, like they are still loved.”
Dallas officials have also urged residents to go about their normal activities and attend community gatherings and fairs without fear.
“The broader perspective is that we had done immediate disease tracking and contact tracing and the family had been identified who had had close contact and they had not shown any symptoms,” said Thompson. “Other than that one case, basically, his virus has been contained.”

Yorkshire full of home-grown cricketerscricket
Yorkshire will continue to supply England with between a third and half the Test side, writes Ted Corbett
I went to the annual cricket writers’ dinner this week and, amazingly, no-one cared to mention the name of the England captain Alastair Cook who shortly leads the one-day team to Sri Lanka and who will be in charge for the World Cup.
We must have come to the conclusion that whatever we write or broadcast we are stuck with him, or we have swallowed the belief that he is the only possible choice, and are waiting for the inevitable defeat.
Instead we concentrated on proper cricket matters like the eating of the good beef of old England, drinking the deep red wine of old France and giving all the prizes to Yorkshiremen.
As I may have mentioned before Yorkshire won the championship with a match to spare and despite the last minute ban on its captain Andrew Gale.
He was on an adjacent table so I took the opportunity to ask him about what he said to the South African Ashwell Prince during the match against Lancashire and the two-match ban that followed. In a long life I have learnt that if you ask a Yorkshire sportsman a straight question you will get a straight answer in one of the strongest accents in Britain and you have to be prepared to justify your question.
Captain Gale was no exception. He declined to – as he put it – “take the credit for the victory over Nottinghamshire” which he missed because of his ban but which settled the championship.
“It was nothing to do with winning for me. The lads had fought hard all summer for the title and were absolutely determined to win it,” he said.
Tough but polite
He looks tough but he is polite and affable and refuses to feel sorry for himself. “I know I was wrong to have a go at Prince and the ECB were quite right to punish me.”
In the long run it will not matter. Yorkshire is so strong, so full of good, home-grown cricketers from its own Academy that it will win more First Division championships even though it will continue to supply England with between a third and half the Test side.
The top three batsmen in the national averages were also in the Yorkshire team this summer, led by Joe Root. Jonny Bairstow, a fine wicketkeeper, who was — apparently — not good enough to be in the Test line-up. I hope it has nothing to do with the backing he was given so often by Geoff Boycott but no-one can be sure.
More and more lads from a sub-continental background are getting into the Yorkshire Academy and, remember, that not too long ago they were not welcome at Headingley, although eventually common sense prevailed.
I once got lost on my way to the Academy when it was in Bradford. I asked three or four white lads and they said they didn’t know. I tried a lad clearly with connections in Karachi or Lahore and he told me in an instant.
That is the way it ought to be for a county who have thrown off the daftness — that is an old-fashioned Yorkshire word if ever there was one — of only picking from men born in the county. They might even pick Cook but he would have to learn to embrace what they call The Yorkshire Way.
Don’t ask me what is meant by The Yorkshire Way. Its players talk about it all the time but it’s a dressing room secret and even though Gale and I got along famously he would not tell me, a Yorkshireman through my ancestry, my upbringing and my cricket of rather less than championship standard.

GoPro is doubling down on what it does bestGlass
October 6, 2014
GoPro, the maker of  small and rugged cameras  known for capturing surreal footage of action sports and other adventures, just offered more proof that it’s chiefly a hardware company, despite its recent claims to the contrary . Yes, it has a wildly popular YouTube channel, a channel on Virgin America’s  in-flight entertainment system , and a Microsoft Xbox channel that serve as potent marketing tools. But all those outlets depend on the one thing that makes money for the company: its cameras.
As such, it just introduced a new retail display of its wares at 500 Best Buy stores. The 6-foot-high displays  center around the Hero4 , its newest all-purpose, hands-free GoPro camera.
Well-timed for early holiday shopping, the move, according to GoPro , will triple the company’s in-store presence. The display features large monitors showcasing  daredevil videos and new perspectives  shot with its products, which do all the talking in convincing buyers to shell out hundred and sometimes thousand of dollars for the cameras and requisite accessories .
GoPro needs the boost. Its recent media marketing blitz couldn’t hide the fact that its  first earnings report  after going public was far less thrilling than the videos coming off its cameras.

Real estate sector still cool  but building for a boomReal estate sector still cool, but building for a boom
Raghavendra Kamath |  Oct 06, 2014 10:31 PM IST
Most realty experts say: Don't expect the sector to turn round soon, especially the residential segment. While the new government has raised hopes and improved sentiments of investors, companies and experts believe a revival is at least a year away. But commercial properties will be in demand.
The property sector is expected to grow at a snail's pace. High inflation and lower gross domestic product (GDP) growth won't help much.
"I do not think the real-estate price rise will beat inflation in the next one year. It can happen in two years," said Ashutosh Limaye, head of research and real estate intelligence at Jones Lang LaSalle.
"Prices will rise steadily and not exponentially as five to six years ago." He said investors' return expectations should be in line with reality.
Property prices doubled in Mumbai between 2005 and 2008. "We are at a high base. Prices cannot go up rapidly from here," said Limaye.
Amit Goenka, managing director and chief executive of Nifco, a financial services firm, said the sector will revive only after the GDP growth improves and domestic savings go up. "It will take at least a year for things to start looking up," he said. Even developers say revival is some time away. "The ground situation continues to be challenging and demanding. It will take a few more quarters for it to improve," DLF, the country's largest developer, said in the latest analyst presentation.
Global property consultancy Colliers International expects prices to go up marginally or remain stable.
"We anticipate a stable price scenario in Mumbai and the National Capital Region due to high price points. However, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata may see marginal appreciation due to increased demand," said the latest report by Colliers.
High interest rates and prices mean low affordability. Also, developers have huge inventories.
By estimates of Knight Frank, till June developers in top-six cities of the country had an inventory of 0.63 million homes.
By estimates of another, the inventory levels across most top cities have been on the rise for a year. The absorption rate (sales as percentage of the total inventory) has been declining in most top cities. Even the pre-sales (sold but not delivered) trend is weak.
But some segments could see more action. Colliers said most of these cities may see the launch of affordable projects. Many are planning to launch such projects in line with the government's agenda of focusing on this type of housing.
Limaye said cities which were industry, education, and trade and commerce hubs were expected to see heightened activity in residential properties due to the government's focus on such areas.
Investors in commercial properties can also look to better days as things are picking up.
"There has been a reasonable improvement in leasing. In two quarters, we have seen 20 per cent reduction in vacancies in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore," said Goenka.
Limaye said rents will rise rapidly in secondary business districts due to good infrastructure, accessibility to residential areas and good buildings.
The expected launch of real estate investment trusts or Reits is expected boost the commercial segment and open a new investment avenue for retail investors. But it may be a while before action starts on the Reits front. Though the central government had given a pass-through status for Reits in the Budget, developers said due to tax leakages, the instrument was not viable. So, till these are resolved, the sector may have to wait.

This Is Why Your Voice Sounds So Frickin  Weird To Youreddit
Have you ever listened to a recording of your own voice and thought, "Whoa. Do I really sound like that?" Well, it's time to face the music. You really do.
As it turns out, there's a simple explanation for why your voice sounds so different (likely lower) to you than to other people -- check it out in the latest episode from the Youtube series SciShow in the video above.
"When you hear your own voice as you talk, you're really hearing a couple different things at once," Hank Green, host of the series, says in the video. "You're hearing the sound thats coming out of your mouth... but you're also hearing the sound bouncing around inside your own head, which is conducted by your flesh and bones directly to your inner ear."
That fleshy stuff, according to Green, is better at transmitting low frequencies than high ones, which makes you think your voice sounds lower than it does to other people.
Now you know.

Festival fails to cheer loansFestival fails to cheer loans
Nupur Anand | Mumbai Oct 04, 2014 11:05 PM IST
Festive fervour ahead of Diwali appears to have done little to support banks’ sagging credit growth. Despite attractive interest rates being offered and processing fees getting waived, lenders’ credit at the start of this year’s festival season has grown at the slowest rate in at least seven years.
According to latest data, loans offered by banks during the period between August and the third week of September increased by a mere Rs 17,800 crore on an annual basis, compared with Rs 1.08 lakh crore during the comparable period of last year.
Punjab National Bank Executive Director Ram Sangapure cites low corporate demand as a reason for this slow pace of credit growth in the country’s banking system. “Corporate credit is yet to pick up. This has affected growth for the overall system. The numbers look dismal because companies have not participated in the recovery so far. In fact, demand from corporate houses, especially those from the steel, textiles, power and coal sectors, has come to a standstill.”
On a year-on-year basis, the present rate of growth in bank credit has been the slowest since June 2011, thanks to an economic slowdown. According to data from the Reserve Bank of India, annual credit growth had fallen to a single-digit rate of 9.7 per cent as of September 19, compared with 17.6 per cent in the year-ago period. The rate for this financial year so far has been 2.5 per cent, against 6.5 per cent a year ago.
The central bank has pointed out that the corporate sector is moving to alternative sources for their funding needs and tapping the commercial paper market. The resources raised through commercial papers this year, according to RBI, are “significantly” higher than last year. Financing from other sources like foreign direct investment and external commercial borrowings has also increased, RBI said in its bi-monthy monetary policy review last week.
The low pace of credit growth is more worrisome because banks’ deposit growth, at a healthy annual rate of 13.4 per cent, has been steady. In a reversal of the trend seen in the past few years, deposit growth has this year outpaced credit growth.
With demand from corporate houses remaining sluggish, lenders are increasingly banking on retail loans, such as housing and auto, to push sales. Demand for retail loans, though lower than last year, remains better that that from companies, say bankers.
“Demand for credit has not been good, despite this being a festival season. We are now beginning to see some improvement but it has so far been tepid for the banking system as a whole,” says
A Surendran, general manager & head (retail) at Federal Bank.
Bankers are now pinning their hopes on a revival in credit offtake after Diwali. They, however, contend that it might only be a modest one and a remarkable turnaround could take some time.

Japanese auto major Nissan will drive in its second model from the Datsun portfolio, a Multi-purpose Vehicle Go+, in the first part of next year as part plans to enhance its presence. The GO+ is a seven seater MPV and is among the three models under the Datsun brand that Nissan has announced that it would launch by FY16.
The company is looking to increase sales of both Nissan and Datsun branded vehicles in India to meet its target of capturing 8 per cent market share in the country, although the timeline has been moved due to the slowdown witnessed in the automobile market in the past couple of years.
“The Datsun GO+ will be launched in the first part of next year,” Nissan India operations President Guillaume Sicard told PTI.
Mr. Sicard, who assumed the role last week, said the idea was to build up the presence of the Datsun brand in India.
Earlier this year, the Datsun brand made a global comeback with Nissan launching its entry level car ‘Datsun Go’ priced between Rs. 3.12 lakh and Rs. 3.70 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) in India.
“The Datsun (hatchback) has received positive response. The product is recognised as a quality product and its delivery is up to our expectations,” he said.
It is expected to compete with the likes of Maruti Suzuki Ertiga, Honda Mobilio and General Motors’ Enjoy.
On Nissan’s ambitions in India, Mr. Sicard said: “We want to increase the sales of our two brands - Nissan and Datsun. Today we are at full speed, we want to continue to grow further.”
In the April-September period of the current fiscal, Nissan had registered sales of 25,741 units, as against 12,515 units in the same period last fiscal, up 105.68 per cent. The Indian passenger vehicle market stood at 2.5 million units last year and Nissan had 1.3 per cent market share.
Mr. Sicard said the aim would be to meet the target of capturing 8 per cent market share in India as part of global aim of the company to have similar market share 2016-17 earlier. He said the production capacity at the Chennai plant of the Renault-Nissan alliance has been expanded to up to 4.8 lakh units annually from 4 lakh earlier, which could meet requirements for the next two years.

Trio win medicine Nobel for discovering brain s  GPSprint
American-British scientist John O'Keefe and Norwegian scientists May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discovering the "inner GPS" in the brain that helps us navigate through the world.
Their findings in rats - and research suggests that humans have the same system in their brains - represented a "paradigm shift" in the knowledge of how cells work together to perform cognitive functions, the Nobel Assembly said, adding that knowing about the brain's positioning system may "help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss" that affects people with Alzheimer's disease.

"This year's Nobel Laureates have discovered a positioning system, an 'inner GPS' in the brain, that makes it possible to orient ourselves in space," the assembly said.
O'Keefe, 75, of University College London, discovered the first component of this system in 1971 when he found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room. He demonstrated that these "place cells" were building up a map of the environment, not just registering visual input.
Thirty-four years later, in 2005, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser, a married couple at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, identified another type of nerve cell - the "grid cell" - that generates a coordinate system for precise positioning and path-finding, the assembly said.
"This is crazy," an excited May-Britt Moser, 51, told The Associated Press by telephone from Trondheim.

She said her 52-year-old husband didn't immediately find out about the prize because he was flying Monday morning to the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany, to demonstrate their research.
"This is such a great honor for all of us and all the people who have worked with us and supported us," she said, adding they had been together for 30 years. "We are going to continue and hopefully do even more groundbreaking work in the future."
Hege Tunstad, a spokeswoman at the university in Trondheim, said May-Britt Moser "needed a minute to cry and speak with her team" when she first heard the news.
Edvard Moser told the Norwegian news agency NTB that he discovered he was a Nobel Prize winner when he landed in Munich, turned on his cellphone and saw a flood of emails, text messages and missed calls.
"I didn't know anything. When I got off the plane there was a representative there with a bouquet of flowers who said 'congratulations on the prize,'" he was quoted as saying.
The Nobel discoveries have also opened new avenues for understanding cognitive functions such as memory, thinking and planning, the assembly said.
"Thanks to our grid and place cells, we don't have to walk around with a map to find our way each time we visit a city because we have that map in our head," said Juleen Zierath, chair of the medicine prize committee. "I think, without these cells, we would have a really hard time to survive."
All three Nobel laureates won Columbia University's Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize last year for their discoveries. They will split the Nobel prize money of 8 million Swedish kronor (about $1.1 million).

The Nobel awards in physics, chemistry, literature and peace will be announced later this week. The economics prize will be announced next Monday. Created by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prizes were first awarded in 1901. The winners always collect their awards on Dec 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.
Last year's medicine award went to researchers who discovered how substances are transported within cells, a process involved in such important activities as brain cell communication and the release of insulin.

HEALTH CARE IN AISLE 9You Can Now Get Health Insurance At Walmart

NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is taking one-stop shopping to another area: health insurance.
The world's largest retailer plans to work with DirectHealth.com, an online health insurance comparison site and agency, to allow shoppers to compare coverage options and enroll in Medicare plans or the public exchange plans created under the Affordable Care Act.
The strategy is another step into insurance marketing as the retailer tries to use its mammoth size to expand beyond food and other basics at a time of sluggish traffic and sales. It also could help Wal-Mart compete with drugstore chains such as Walgreen and CVS, which are rapidly adding health care services.
Wal-Mart says that the program targets shoppers who have been confused by the enrollment process and about their health insurance programs. They include those whose employers scaled back their coverage to those who don't have any insurance. That has sent customers shopping around on various health care sites or at various kiosks set up by specific insurance companies.
With Wal-Mart program called "Healthcare Begins Here," customers can enroll online, by phone or at 2,700 of Wal-Mart's more than 4,000 stores, starting Oct. 10. The stores will be staffed with independent insurance agents from DirectHealth.com.
In April, Wal-Mart teamed up with Autoinsurance.com to let shoppers quickly find and buy insurance policies online. DirectHealth.com and Autoinsurance.com are owned and operated by Tranzutary Insurance Solutions LLC, a subsidiary of Tranzact of Fort Lee, New Jersey, which set up Tranzutary specifically to work with Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart won't receive commissions on health coverage sales and hopes to benefit partly by luring customers into stores. DirectHealth is absorbing most of the costs to operate the program, Labeed Diab, senior vice president and president of Wal-Mart's health and wellness division, told The Associated Press.
Wal-Mart plans to launch a TV, radio and in-store promotions campaign this month.
Since 2005, Wal-Mart has hosted health insurance agents from individual insurers in stores to field questions and enroll customers. But Diab said that with the Affordable Care Act, shoppers found the search for coverage more complicated.
He cited outside research that shows that more than 60 percent of people have difficulty understanding their health insurance options and nearly 40 percent feel they picked the wrong plan after enrollment.
"We saw a greater need to bring more transparency and simplicity," Diab said. He noted the strategy is also part of Wal-Mart's strategy to build business in wellness and health care. But he also is counting on the program to bring more customers to the store.
"The more we can broaden the assortment, the more we can educate our customer, the better off we will be," he added.
As part of Wal-Mart's expansion into health care, it is testing 11 health care clinics run by Wal-Mart itself that offer primary care such as health screenings and management of chronic conditions like diabetes. That's different from its 100 leased health care clinics in its stores that focus on basic services like flu shots.
The health insurance program works this way: For customers over 65, DirectHealth.com offers access to more than 1,700 plans from 12 carriers including Aetna, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare during the Medicare open enrollment period from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.
For customers under age 65, DirectHeath.com offers access to thousands of health exchange plans from more than 300 carriers. That open enrollment period is Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.
Customers can compare or enroll over the phone by calling 888-383-2111.

Becton Dickinson gets CareFusion for $12BBecton Dickinson to buy CareFusion for $12.2 billion

The healthcare sector has been rife with deal-making  as companies continue to consolidate in the wake of pressure to reduce healthcare costs under Obamacare. The latest: medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson, which is acquiring medical products manufacturer CareFusion. The $12.2 billion cash and stock  deal values CareFusion  at $58 a share.
News of the deal boosted Becton Dickson BDX   8% to $124.98 and CareFusion CFN  23% to $56.75 in heavy trading.
The deal “allows us to align our highly complementary technologies and products to address unmet needs in the growing $20 billion global medication management industry,” says Becton Dickson CEO Vincent Forlenza.
“It accelerates BD’s transition from a product-focused company to a customer-centric provider of innovative healthcare solutions with leading scale across the medication management value chain and expanded solutions for patient safety,” Forlenz said. “With the targeted cost savings we have identified and the growth opportunities we see in bringing CareFusion products to more patients and healthcare workers around the world, we expect this transaction to create meaningful value for our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders.”
About 77% of San Diego-based CareFusion’s sales, including infusion pumps, automated dispensing systems,  surgical instruments and medical surveillance software, are in the U.S., while more than 50% of Becton Dickson’s revenue comes from overseas sales.
Becton Dickson says the merger will  provide double-digit earnings per share growth within the first full year of the merger and $250 million in synergy related cost savings  by 2018.  The companies expect the deal to be completed by mid-2015.
CareFusion was spun off from Cardinal Health  in August  2009. In April, it paid out $40 million to settle  Justice Department allegations over sales and marketing practices over alleged kickbacks to doctors for promoting products not approved by the Food & Drug Administration.
The Becton Dickinson merger could result in a $33.2 million change-of-control payout for CareFusion CEO Kieran Gallahue, according to the company’s annual proxy.
Gallahue, who joined CareFusion in 2011,  received compensation valued at $10.8 million in the latest fiscal year and gained another $18.5 million from vested shares and exercising stock options.

NEW DELHI: Private sector lender ICICI Bank has acquired a 5.15 per cent stake in Hindustan Motors as part of settlement with the cash strapped maker of the iconic Ambassador car.
In a filing to the BSE , Hindustan Motors said ICICI Bank has acquired 1.07 crore shares of the company, totalling to 5.15 per cent stake, on September 29.
"ICICI Bank has received 1,07,43,600 equity shares of Hindustan Motors Ltd in lieu of settlement of Right of Recompense (RoR) payable to the lenders on the exit of HML from the purview of corporate debt restructuring (CDR)," the filing said.
On September 29, the board of Hindustan Motors had alloted securities on a preferential basis to the lenders, banks and financial institutions, in accordance with approval of corporate debt restructuring process.
Earlier this year, the cash-strapped company's management had declared suspension of work at its Uttarpara plant in the West Bengal.
The Uttarpara plant, which manufactures Ambassador car, had been facing severe cash crunch, and orders for manufacturing cars could not be executed. Since then the company has suspended the production of the Ambassador car.

Flipkart fumbles with its biggest-ever sale  website crashes‘Marked up’ prices, server crash spoil Flipkart party
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 06, 2014

The great deals and discounts that e-commerce majors such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and others are announcing in full-page advertisements every day this festive season may not all be for real.
India’s biggest e-commmerce company, Flipkart, in particular earned the ire of disgruntled shoppers by offering some supposedly discounted items at prices higher than what rivals such as Amazon and Snapdeal were offering.
For instance, a MacBookAir 13” was priced at Rs. 56,490 on Flipkart but Snapdeal sold it for Rs. 49,999.
In other instances, the company allegedly marked up the retail prices of some products and then offered “discounts” that brought the selling prices close to market rates.
“But the digital customer is smart. With so many social sites, it will be difficult to pull a wool over their eyes. They will see through any such attempt,” said Sandeep Komaravelly, senior VP (marketing) at rival Snapdeal.com.
To be fair, this practice of ramping up prices and then offering a “discount” was not true for all products, since a few discounts were genuine and lapped up by the customers.
Flipkart’s big festive season sale, The Big Billion Day, overburdened its servers, which crashed within two hours of the sale opening, angering shoppers further. “The traffic was heavy but our server did not crash,” a Flipkart spokesperson said, but refused to give any details.
Shoppers took to Twitter, Facebook and blogging to attack the company’s pricing.
A Twitter user, @Surnell, posted screenshots of what purported to show Flipkart raising prices of a product in the run-up to the sale only to slap a discount on Monday.

“We got a billion hits on our site today and achieved our 24 hour sales target of $100 million (Rs 600 crore) in gross merchandise value (industry lingo for sales) in just 10 hours.
We are truly humbled by the immense faith our customers have shown in us,” Flipkart’s promoters Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said in a statement on Monday evening.
Underlining the fierce battle for customers among e-commerce companies, Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, bought the domain name “bigbillionday.com” (Flipkart’s name for its sale), which redirects customers to amazon.com and trolls Flipkart.
Monday’s sale brought hordes of shoppers not only to Flipkart but to other retailers as well. “We have seen a 30% jump today and over the last week, the traffic has been 10% higher than what we get very month,” Snapdeal’s Komaravelly.
Amazon spokesperson said, “Today, on the last day of our ‘Mission to Mars’ campaign, we have witnessed a 100% increase in sales since yesterday.
It is our biggest day ever and we believe it is owed to the introduction of Dhamaka deals every hour through the day  and ensuring the availability of the deals advertised.”
Amazon will hold week three of the “Online Shopping Dhamaka” festive celebrations followed by the “Diwali Dhamaka Week” starting October 10.

Uddhav Thackeray compares Team Modi campaign to Afzal Khan s armyUddhav compares BJP campaign to Afzal Khan's army

In the worst-ever attack yet on former ally BJP, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday likened the ongoing poll campaign in Maharashtra by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet to an assault by Bijapur general Afzal Khan's army on Shivaji's dominion in the 17th century.
"What are they up to? First Modi comes to campaign, then his entire cabinet team is campaigning for votes in Maharashtra. They are like the army of Afzal Khan trying to conquer this state," Uddhav thundered at a huge public rally in the temple of town of Tuljapur.
He noted out that besides Modi, the home minister, external affairs minister, chief ministers and other top leaders were campaigning for the Maharashtra assembly elections scheduled for October 15. 
Read: Where was respect to Balasaheb when you split: Sena asks Modi
The Sena chief alleged that their whole intention is "to break the state into pieces" in the name of bringing progress and development here.
"But, the people of Maharashtra will not tolerate such attempts. They (team Modi) will be made to bite the dust," he asserted to applause from the people.
He pointed out that Afzal Khan too met a similar fate when he tried to break up the Maratha empire of Chhatrapati Shivaji.
"Do you want Maharashtra to be divided into many pieces? Then vote for BJP. Do you?" he asked the gathering, which roared back "no, no."
Modi, during his campaign trail, is noted for his interactive connect with the crowds by asking similar questions and eliciting their responses.
Uddhav recalled his previous rally in Tulzapur in the last week of September when many party activists were reluctant to snap ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party.
"The party workers wanted the Sena flag fluttering in Tuljapur and in Mantralaya (the state government headquarters). But what if the seat went to the BJP quota? The workers were still insistenent," he said.
Just then (September 25), news trickled from Mumbai that the BJP had unilaterally snapped its 25-year-old alliance with the Shiv Sena, he said.
"What BJP?... The breaking of the alliance was probably the will of Goddess Tulja Bhavani. I got this feeling," Uddhav said.
However, he acknowledged that if the late BJP leaders Gopinath Munde and Pramod Mahajan were alive, he would not have allowed the alliance to break.

Normality returns  Hong Kong govt. gets upper handUpdated: October 6, 2014 23:56 IST
Normality returns, Hong Kong govt. gets upper hand
Atul Aneja
AP A pro-democracy protester takes an afternoon nap under an overpass near government headquarters in Hong Kong.
TOPICS
Hong Kong
Authorities in Hong Kong seemed have established an upper hand over student-led protesters, who were unable on Monday to prevent civil servants from going back to work, or the reopening of schools, which had remained shuttered for most of last week.
Unlike last week’s surging demonstration of street power, the number of protesters dwindled into hundreds in the three major protest sites: Mong Kok; Causeway Bay, the shopping district; and Admiralty, the seat of government offices.
Reopening of schools
There was more bad news for the agitators when Sophia Wong, Principal Assistant Secretary of the Education Bureau announced that all 51 primary schools in Wan Chai and Central and Western districts will resume classes on Tuesday. She added that the bureau would decide on the date when kindergartens in these areas could also open.
With the government stealing a march over activists, the stage seemed set for a dialogue with the protesters, who could no longer talk from a position of strength. The Federation of Students was to meet Undersecretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Lau Kong-wah, later in the evening on Monday to prepare for talks with Chief Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.
Alex Chow, the leader of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, nevertheless kept a brave front, pointing out that the agitation would get its second wind in case the authorities were insincere about the talks.
“This is definitely not the end. We’ve never set a timeframe for how long this should go on. It’s normal for people to go home, to come and go,” said Mr. Chow.
The South China Morning Post, based in Hong Kong, quoted him as saying that, “The ball is in the government’s court … We are all waiting and watching how the government acts, to see if this is their tactic to draw this out or whether they are willing to actually hold dialogue.”
Talks on reforms
The talks are expected to focus on political reforms, rather than on seeking the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying, as had been demanded earlier.
The opposition activists are seeking open nominations for the 2017 elections to the post of Chief Executive. The Chinese government has committed itself to universal suffrage, but has also stated, as part of the Basic Law formulated in 1990, that a nominating committee will vet the candidates, based on extensive consultations for the 2017 CE’s election.
Reflecting the sombre mood in the opposition camp, Anson Chan Fang On-sang, Hong Kong’s former Chief Secretary who now heads the pro-democracy think-tank ‘Hong Kong 2020’, slammed the British government for its “profoundly disappointing responses” to the protests.
In an op-ed in The Guardian, she chastised Britain for its unwillingness to stand up to China. “Their first instinct is to keep their heads low; they just want things to carry on as before, would like the protests to disappear, and maintain good relations with China.”
Ms. Anson Chan is a regular visitor to western capitals including Washington. In April, she along with Martin Lee, another pro-democracy activist, visited Washington, where they met U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
They also spoke at the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a highly controversial U.S. government funded-foundation, well known for mentoring protest movements in Eastern Europe and Latin America.

The thrill of surprise and the agony of the miss. Earnings season returns this week.
Alcoa (AA) unofficially kicks off earnings season Wednesday. The aluminum company is still steaming from being tossed out of the Dow last year. The stock is on fire and so are earnings. Take that! Adjusted earnings are expected to jump 91% in the quarter. And the stock. It’s up more than 40% this year. Not bad for a Dow reject.
Pepsico (PEP) reports its results Thursday. The food maker is a good measure of global demand. Earnings aren’t exactly fizzy. Adjusted profit is seen rising 4% during the quarter. But guess what? Pepsico has a knock at beating estimates. It’s given investors pleasant earnings surprises the past five straight quarters. The stock’s up more than 10% this year.
Investors will also brace for news from Janet Yellen’s Fed. The Fed releases its meeting minutes Wednesday. If the words “higher” and “interest rates” are even in the same sentence, watch out. Investors will probably get cranky and start yellin’.
Get ready for a wild world of markets news this week.

The United States said on Monday it arrested a 19-year-old American at a Chicago airport as he attempted to leave the country to join Islamic State jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria.
Mohammed Hamzah Khan, who arrived at O'Hare International Airport Saturday with a roundtrip ticket to Istanbul, was charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, the Justice Department said.
Law enforcement agents who searched Khan's home in the southwest Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook said they had found multiple handwritten letters by Khan and others expressing support for the IS group, including travel plans and references to IS and jihad.
His ticket, which was purchased in in late September, had a return date for later this week, the Justice Department said.
Authorities said the investigation was still ongoing.
Khan appeared Monday morning in US District Court and remains in custody. He is scheduled for a detention hearing at 10:30 am on Thursday.
Providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Chicago Ventures invests in Curbside pickup shopping app0
Chicago Ventures was part of an initial $1.5 million seed round, led by AME Cloud Ventures’ Founding Partner Jerry Yang just over a year ago, Larkins said. The Series A round of $8 million was announced Monday, led by San Francisco and London-based Index Ventures, Larkins said.
Larkins declined to release the dollar amount of Chicago Ventures’ investment in the company.
Larkins acknowledged that the space for convenience-craving shoppers is crowded with companies offering same-day delivery, but he thinks Curbside’s approach has promise. It charges the retailer, not the consumer, for the service and avoids getting into the delivery business itself.
“They are taking a little bit different approach” by not offering delivery, Larkins said. “It’s working in the places where they’ve tried it.”
Index Ventures General Partner Mike Volpi, in a blog post released on the company’s website Monday, explained why he thinks Curbside will compete successfully against same-day delivery models from Amazon Fresh, Google Shopping Express and others. He notes that “same-day delivery is really expensive to pull off” and delivery schedules have built-in hindrances to convenience, while costs are typically passed on to the consumer.
The $1.5 million seed round was joined by Chicago Ventures, O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, TenOneTen, WGI Group and individuals including former Yahoo! president and current Costco board member Sue Decker and former Visa president and CEO Carl F. Pascarella, according to Curbside’s statement Monday. Larkins said all of the seed investors have signed on to the Series A round.

Where BJP has nothing to lose but a state togainModi in Aurangabad Saturday; strategic start to campaign. Source: Pavan Khengre
Written by Kavitha Iyer | Latur/beed | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:43 am
Of the  46 BJP MLAs in Maharashtra, the Marathwada region accounts for just two. That makes it obvious why any strategy for a change in government will have to be anchored in these 46 seats, apart from parts of western Maharashtra where the Shiv Sena and the BJP would both look to shell the NCP’s Maratha fortresses.
Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first rallies for the Maharashtra elections, it’s clear now that the BJP’s pitch is for a majority government on its own. And at the heart of the number-crunching behind that pitch would be Marathwada, a fact borne out not only by Modi’s choice of Beed and Aurangabad to kick off his campaign, but also by the fact that Amit Shah too attended a huge rally of about four lakh OBCs at Bhagvangad last Friday. The event is an annual Dussehra gathering of the Vanjara community at the spot canonised by patron saint Sant Bhagvan. Shah made a political speech, asking OBCs to rally behind Pankaja Munde and pitchforking her into a mass leader.
Ramping up its Marathwada presence is shrewd strategy for the BJP. Winning 30 of Marathwada’s 46 seats was critical to the Congress-NCP’s 2009 win. While parts of Marathwada — Latur, Nanded and parts of Hingoli — have been Congress strongholds for years, other areas such as Aurangabad and Parbhani have been the Shiv Sena’s only bastion outside Mumbai and Konkan. In the past, Marathwada’s big fight has been between the Congress and the Shiv Sena, barring Gopinath Munde’s presence in Beed and the more recent BJP-versus-NCP fight in the same district.
Congress MP from Hingoli Rajeev Satav says the fight remains one between the Congress and the Sena. “The Congress will finish first, the Shiv Sena second,” he predicts of the four-cornered contest. His maths is that the BJP and Sena don’t have a CM candidate from Marathwada, while the possibility of Ashok Chavan as chief minister cannot be ruled out. “If the BJP is committed to Munde’s legacy, why don’t they declare Pankaja as CM candidate?” he says.
There is also the Congress theory that since the NCP anyway routinely worked against Congress candidates, the impact of a four-cornered fight will be felt more by the Sena and the BJP.
But the mood on the ground indicates neither the Congress nor the Sena can fully protect its strongholds.
Seat by seat
In the Nanded-Hingoli belt, the BJP has reinforced itself by roping in Madhav Kinhalkar, who had filed a paid-news case against former CM MP Ashok Chavan and other leaders. Ameeta Chavan is expected to win easily in Bhokar, but the BJP is hardly conceding defeat. Only a couple of weeks ago, sarpanchs of about 40 villages in Bhokar were being wooed by the BJP, an effort reportedly engineered by Khatgaonkar.
In Nanded South, Chavan aide and sitting MLA Omprakash Pokarna is continued…

Andhra  Telangana struggle with farm loanwaiverPrint
Written by Sreenivas Janyala | Hyderabad | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:35 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:36 am
The TDP government in Andhra Pradesh and the TRS regime in Telangana are struggling to fulfil their pre-poll promise of waiving farm loans.
While Andhra Pradesh has tied itself up in knots on setting the scheme rolling, the Telangana government missed its own deadline to pay the first installment on September 27, but remitted it haphazardly on September 30, the end of the kharif season.
As a result, some loan accounts received the money while others did not. Due to this, the farmers whose loan accounts did not receive the money would not get benefit of crop insurance for the rabi season starting October 1, nor can they apply for fresh loans. The AP government requires more than Rs 40,000 crore to pay banks while Telangana needs Rs 17,000 crore.
Telangana Agriculture Commissioner B Janardhana Reddy said that the government has set the ball rolling on farm loan waiver.
“On September 30, 90 per cent of the farmers’ loan accounts were credited. Banks may take some time to process and hence some may not have received it in their accounts. Rs 4,250 crore was released by the government. There are close to 35 lakh beneficiaries for farm loan waiver in Telangana. In the first phase, we deposited 25 per cent of the total loan they have taken. For those who were unable to renew crop insurance, we will work out something,’’ Reddy said.
The AP government has floated another scheme to take care of the loan waiver scheme. After promising to deposit the first installment on September 30, the government said it would be able to do so only on October 15.
Like their Telangana counterparts, AP farmers also won’t get fresh loans. The government set up a Resources Management Committee to get funds to fulfil the loan waiver scheme.
TDP Rajya Sabha MP Y Sujana Chowdary, who heads the committee, said the government was setting a Farmers’ Empowerment Corporation which will issue bonds to farmers to waive crop loans.
Bad crop and debt drive two Telangana farmers to end life
Two farmers, who were heavily in debt, allegedly committed suicide in Karimnagar district of Telangana over the weekend. While one consumed pesticide, the other hung himself.
Inadequate rainfall, which led to crop failure, reportedly forced M Tirupati and D Ramesh of Kodimial village to end their lives. With 30 per cent rainfall deficit and groundwater levels dangerously low, the borewells in the state have been rendered useless.
Investigation Officer K Ravi said while Tirupati, a cotton farmer, appears to have committed suicide by consuming pesticide after his crop failed and he ran into heavy debt, police are yet to verify whether D Ramesh’s suicide is also linked to crop failure.
Telangana Agriculture Minister P Srinivas Reddy, however, assured that farm loan waiver would ease the debt burden of most farmers. So far, 187 farmers have committed suicide in the state .

All not happy with saffronCongressPrint

The congress’s attempts to get rid of an ‘anti-Hindu’ tag by celebrating Hindu festivals at the party’s Madhya Pradesh headquarters here has not gone down well with a section of its leaders.
Former PCC secretary Akbar Baig registered his protest Monday by walking into the headquarters carrying non-vegetarian delicacies and other dishes to remind the Congress that it should also celebrate Bakrid as the party swears by secularism.
“I don’t know whether it was the sight of mutton and biryani or the presence of Muslims, but except one, all leaders present in the headquarters maintained distance from me,’’ Baig told The Indian Express.
Incidentally, the party has celebrated several Hindu festivals at the headquarters since installing an idol of lord Ganesha there on August 29. In contrast, BJP in Madhya Pradesh celebrates only Ganesh Chaturthi by installing an idol, a tradition it has followed since decades.
“If they are bent on celebrating festivals, why not include festivals associated with other religions as well,’’ said Baig. The Congress leader said that he had gone to the party office during Dussehra with sweets and vegetarian items.
Baig’s action follows comments from former union minister Kantilal Bhuria, who had opposed installation of idols of Ganesh or Durga, arguing that people belonging to various faiths frequent the PCC office and such a move might hurt their religious feelings.
State Wakf Board ex-chairman Gufran-e-Azam has also spoken against celebrating religious festivals at the headquarters.
The practice of celebrating Hindu festivals was started by PCC chief Arun Yadav. On the opposition from several party leaders, he said, “What’s wrong in celebrating festivals? Our leaders used to associate with festivals outside the PCC office.’’ Congress spokesperson Sangeeta Sharma, however, said the party would celebrate Barkid on October 8. She is responsible for ensuring daily prayers at the PCC and had recently invited girls to the party office for a kanya bhoj .

Pakistan in TurkeysmirrorNew York Times | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:32 am
Having helped create the IS, Ankara has reasons to fear a Taliban-like blowback.   
Last week, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, declared that Turkey is ready “for any cooperation in the fight against terrorism.” But Turkey’s dilemma is far more grave than its leaders realise. Indeed, Turkey’s current situation resembles the early years of Pakistan’s sponsorship of the Taliban. The Islamic State is recruiting militants in Turkey. And failure to clean its own house now could lead Turkey down the path of “Pakistanisation,” whereby a resident jihadist infrastructure causes Sunni extremism to ingrain itself deeply within the fabric of society.
Although Turkey now recognises the threat, it has yet to come to terms with its own responsibility for helping to create it. As Francis J. Ricciardone Jr, the former American ambassador to Turkey, has pointed out, Ankara supported radical groups, including the Nusra Front. Indeed, during the early days of Syria’s civil war, jihadist groups funnelled fighters and resources through Turkey into Syria. Turkey’s intervention in the Syrian civil war parallels Pakistan’s support of the Taliban to affect the course of the Afghan civil war. But the jihadism abetted by Pakistan did not remain across the Afghan border. Turkey may now be witnessing the beginnings of a similar blowback. While the magnitude of Turkey’s recent engagement of jihadist proxies isn’t comparable to Pakistan’s long history of jihadist sponsorship, the late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s ill-fated relationship with the Sunni extremists of Pakistan’s Deobandi movement is still instructive for Turkey.
Pakistan’s experience with blowback began prior to Bhutto’s tenure, when General Zia ul-Haq’s regime backed mujahideen militias as proxies to combat Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Organised by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate with assistance from the United States and Saudi Arabia, the recruitment networks within Pakistan started a radicalisation process among segments of Pakistan’s population. In 1994, Bhutto began to abet militancy to secure Pakistani objectives in Afghanistan. The Bhutto government facilitated a paramilitary force of thousands of madrasa students to cross the border and take control of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. With Pakistan’s help, this militia of “Taliban,” literally “students,” conquered large swaths of Afghan territory and declared its commander, Mullah Omar, to be caliph. Their militancy soon crossed the border. After the initial stage of mobilising volunteers and weapons for jihad in Afghanistan, a second phase developed in which Pakistan witnessed a wave of anti-Shiite violence, including bombings of Karachi’s major Shiite mosques by the Taliban’s sister organization in Pakistan, Sipah-e Sahaba.
The Turkish government’s decision to turn a blind eye to IS activity within its borders has similarly led to the continued…
Turkey’s intervention in the Syrian civil war parallels Pakistan’s support of the Taliban to affect the course of the Afghan civil war.

Look whos splurgingWritten by Saritha Rai | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:26 am
The trademark austerity of southern India’s billionaires is fast disappearing
Not so long ago, billionaires in Bangalore and the rest of southern India hesitated to splurge on trophy homes, lest it be mistaken for extravagance and exhibitionism. Not anymore. In the suburbs of the bustling town of Thrissur, about 75 kilometres northeast of Ernakulam, three grand homes are getting their final finishing touches within a gated community. From the outside, the homes look modern and stylish but otherwise unremarkable. However, their indoors are gasp-worthy, fitted with accoutrements rarely seen in the dwellings of the traditional rich in south India.
Each of the three homes belonging to the family of T.S. Kalyanaraman, 66, the billionaire promoter of the jewellery chain Kalyan, stands on adjacent one-acre plots. The houses sprawl over areas of about 35,000 sq ft each and have been four-and-a-half years in the making. Each home is in a distinctive style, costs about 75 crore rupees, and is within a couple of minutes walking distance from the family’s private helipad, Kerala’s first, from where the ride to their private aircraft, parked at the Kochi airport, is just 10 minutes. The father, Kalyanaraman, and sons Rajesh and Ramesh, are scheduled to move into the homes soon.
The family has illustrious neighbours. Joy Alukkas of the eponymous jewellery chain is a competitor in the marketplace, but a friend and neighbour within the walled community. P.N.C. Menon of the real estate conglomerate Sobha Developers has plans for a future home in the gated community, which is promoted by his own company.
Thrissur ranks 138 among India’s largest cities, but a disproportionate number of successful businessmen have their roots there. Besides the two jewellery chain owners and the real estate developer, the owners of gold finance firm Muthoot finance, the Muthoot brothers, and the Gulf-based retail billionaire, Yusuff Ali, as well as the promoters of several Kerala-based banks, hail from the town. In fact, Yusuff Ali’s own Kerala home is a 60,000-sq ft, three-level waterfront residence with 11 bedrooms and a helipad that stands on three acres (to put that in context, the White House is a 55,000-sq ft dwelling that stands on 18 acres).
Like many of their successful peers with smalltown origins, Thrissur’s flourishing entrepreneurs have sprouted wings for their business but have chosen to grow their roots in their birthplace. The palatial new homes in the unlikely location of Thrissur mirror a trend visible in every corner of India, as more such homes come up in towns like Ajmer and Siliguri and Coimbatore.
“Many Indian entrepreneurs travel the world, are exposed to opulence everywhere they go, and now want the same comfort and luxury in their homes,” said Ramesh Kalyanaraman, 36, the younger of Kalyanaraman’s two sons. He said the brothers and the father travelled extensively outside India, as many as five to 10 days a month, and usually stayed in plush hotels. “When we returned home, we wanted the same level of well-being for ourselves and our families; we cannot lead two lives,” he said.
In the continued…

Dont blame MSP forinflationFacts hardly support Surjit Bhalla’s conclusion that inflation in India is entirely driven by changes in the MSP. (Reuters)
Written by Amartya Lahiri | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:20 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 8:03 am
Ill-thought-out assertions about the efficacy of monetary policy can unhinge private expectations of inflation.
The Indian Express recently published two articles by Surjit S. Bhalla on the subject of inflation in India (‘Where monetary policy is irrelevant’, September 13 and ‘RBI, we have a problem’, September 20). Bhalla’s central thesis is that inflation in India is primarily driven by changes in the minimum support prices (MSP) for agricultural goods. He then uses this “fact” to argue that, since monetary policy has no effect on inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should lower interest rates to spur growth. However, both his conclusions are problematic.
Let us start with the relationship between the MSP and inflation. Given the large share of food in the consumer price index (CPI), no one can or should argue that increases in the MSP have no inflationary consequences. Rather, the key question to ask is what factors cause the MSP itself to move. While the government possibly takes into account a number of factors in determining the MSP, a key input is clearly inflation itself. Rising overall price levels, without corresponding increases in agricultural prices, implies a loss of real purchasing power for the farmer. Increases in the MSP provide the farmer with insulation against such a loss.
In as much as the MSP itself responds to current and past inflation, a part of the reported effect of the MSP on inflation is then just the effect of past inflation on current inflation, rather than any independent effect of changes in the MSP on inflation. The MSP may well have an independent effect on inflation, but to determine that one needs to break up MSP inflation into two parts: the part that is induced by current and past inflation and the part that is not. The key test then is to see which of these two components of the MSP has the bigger effect on inflation.
Using the CPI (industrial workers) and a weighted MSP index for the period of 1976-2014, I did precisely that exercise. The bottom-line of the results is that, using the part of the MSP due to past inflation to predict inflation does almost as good a job
as using the overall MSP. Moreover, when both components of MSP changes are used to predict inflation, the effect of inflation-induced MSP is three times as high as that of non-inflation MSP. The main implication of this is that the biggest predictor of inflation is past inflation. It is clear that past MSP changes due to inflation account for a much larger part of overall CPI inflation than does non-inflation MSP.
There is an even bigger kick to these results. If one predicts inflation using both components of the MSP, but using continued…
Facts hardly support Surjit Bhalla’s conclusion that inflation in India is entirely driven by changes in the MSP. Consequently, that the RBI has no influence on inflation, does not follow either.

The Good Wife gets religion rightBy Alyssa Rosenberg October 6 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
I have written about the spark “The Good Wife” gets from arguments between its agnostic main character, attorney Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) and her daughter, Grace (Makenzie Vega), a convert to Christianity. Pop culture characters rarely talk about religion, unless it is to wonder at the practices of believers who rarely get to speak for themselves, so these discussions make Alicia and Grace feel more alive and specific than many of their fictional counterparts.

Last night, the show put on a clinic on another facet of how religion might be incorporated into pop culture beyond everyday discussions. In a very funny episode titled “Dear God,” “The Good Wife” left behind the courtroom at the request of two men who asked that their conflict over genetically modified seeds be settled in an arbitration process guided by Christian principles (for the skeptical, this conciliation process is a real thing ).
“Wendell is my neighbor,” Ed Pratt (Richard Thomas), a wealthy developer of a new seed strain who was suing a farmer (Robert Joy) for stealing the seeds, told his legal team. “I have a disagreement with him, not you all.”
Part of what worked about “Dear God” is that the targets of the humor were the lawyers rather than Ed, Wendell or their mediator, Del (Robert Sean Leonard).
The legal teams bicker over who can answer Del’s questions, assuming that legal standards about speculation, leading questions and expertise are what is important. Instead, Del keeps insisting that Ed and Wendell’s honest impressions of what they were doing is what truly matters. Trained to believe that everyone lies and that withholding information is often the best strategy, Alicia and her colleagues are flummoxed by an environment that assumes trustworthiness and good intentions.
As the case goes on, the lawyers get excited by the idea of Christianity as a tool they can use in much the same way they employ legal texts and precedents.
When Del suggests that sin cannot exist without intention, Alicia goes to Grace for help combing through the Bible to find verses to suggest the opposite. The two end up in an argument not about their usual subject — Alicia’s inability to understand Grace’s faith — but rather the practice of proof-texting , the practice of taking quotations out of context to prove a point, even though the whole of the text may not support that argument.
The conversation moved from there into a discussion of how Grace approaches the Bible. In explaining that, Grace brought Alicia closer than ever into getting why she believes. “That sounds … smart,” Alicia told her daughter. It is a wonderful scene about the law and the case of the week that also advances a long-running character thread between mother and daughter. “The Good Wife” pulled all that off while explaining a concept that might be unfamiliar to a lot of secular viewers without losing the flow of the dialogue.
Later, when the case started going badly for Wendell, his lawyer tried to shift the whole process by suggesting that the patent system could not be applied to life without violating Christian principles. It was a rhetorical move that was all about strategic advantage and not remotely about conviction. While the lawyers began behaving in arbitration exactly as they behaved in court, Ed and Wendell came to their own conclusion: Wendell admitted he had tried to get around the price of Ed’s seeds, and Ed agreed to give Wendell a discount for the sake of neighborliness. What mattered to them was not patents, profits or whether God approves of ownership of life but how to live fairly with one another.
For Ed and Wendell, the legal system was the initial venue where it made sense for their case to land, but the law turned out to be laughably insufficient to their actual priorities and needs. And for “The Good Wife,” which has always drawn a great deal of its distinctive power from its clear-eyed perspective on what the law does to the people who practice it , “Dear God” was a smart way to remind audiences of the limitations of secular deities.
If more pop culture approached faith with this sort of sophistication and humor, religious viewers and atheist or agnostic ones might find that they have more in common than we and the entertainment industry often assume.

Chase Refuses To Admit How Many People Were Actually HackedJPMorgan Refuses To Admit How Many People Were Actually Hacked
Posted:
reddit
JPMorgan Chase is refusing to say how many individuals had their personal information stolen by hackers in the recent massive security breach . But that information is critical in understanding the potential consequences of the hack.
The bank, the nation's largest by assets, disclosed last week that 76 million households were affected by the breach, which took place over the summer.
JPMorgan spokeswoman Trish Wexler said the bank is not offering additional details beyond what it has already announced.
Since disclosing the hack in a regulatory filing last Thursday , JPMorgan has only noted that 76 million households were affected. That's a huge number, just shy of two-thirds of American households, making the breach the largest cyberattack against a bank in history .
Yet the company has not disclosed a separate, presumably even larger figure: the number of individual customers whose personal information was compromised.
JPMorgan has said that no account information was stolen by the hackers, but that they were able to access contact details like names, phone numbers and email and home addresses. Internal bank information, such as what types of accounts individuals held, was also stolen. The bank has argued that because contact information was stolen, as opposed to account details, the best way to measure the size of the hack is by households, not individuals.
It seems like an obvious point to note that if 76 million households were hacked, the number of affected individuals is likely even larger. There could be many people in a single household with JPMorgan Chase accounts.
It is, however, a point worth emphasizing. Having individual customer names and email addresses will allow hackers to run phishing scams targeted at individuals, not households. For JPMorgan to publicize only the number of households at risk, without disclosing the number of individuals, gives a distorted impression of the attack's true scope.
Chester Wisniewski, an adviser at the security firm Sophos, told The Huffington Post that the attack "puts Chase customers at high risk for phishing and social engineering" scams -- even if those kinds of scams weren't the hackers' original purpose.
If the hackers "aren't interested in the information," said Wisniewski, "they will sell it to someone who is."
The sheer scale of JPMorgan's consumer banking business, and the ubiquity of its online presence, underscore the severity of the breach. JPMorgan Chase is the largest credit card issuer in the U.S. by loan value, with 65.8 million open accounts . The bank also has 30.1 million checking accounts. It's the second largest mortgage originator in the U.S., and the country's third largest auto-lender not owned by a car manufacturer. And according to its annual report , Chase.com is the most visited financial services website in America.

Flipkart s loss is competitors  gainFlipkart's loss is competitors' gain
Anusha Soni & Digbijay Mishra | New Delhi Oct 07, 2014 12:33 AM IST
Flipkart had tried to trump Amazon founder & chief executive officer (CEO) Jeff Bezos' recent visit to India with its announcement of a 'Big Billion Sale' on October 6. However, Amazon and Snapdeal seem to have gained the most from Flipkart's big billion sale troubles. "While Flipkart spent crores on advertisements, Snapdeal turns out to be a silent killer," read a tweet on Twitter. While most buyers at Flipkart complained of inflated prices, out-of-stock products and other issues, Snapdeal tried to fill the gap with better discounts, offers and services. American giant Amazon - whose monthly sale is on, prior to Diwali, had products listed on its website at much lower price points compared to Flipkart.
Snapdeal not only gained positive reviews on social media but experts claim the sale experience would also play a role in brand loyalty and customer acquisition in the highly competitive e-commerce market. At about 5.30 pm on Monday evening "CheckSnapdealtoday" was the top trend for Twitter India. "We have already witnessed 15 times growth in traffic today and more trends and clarity would emerge as the day progresses. We are keeping pace with the best deals and pricing in product-to-product compared to what other competitors are offering today," said Sandeep Komaravelly, marketing vice-president at Snapdeal. Kunal Bahl, co-founder and CEO, Snapdeal, later stated. His company clocked sales worth over Rs 1 crore a minute, with millions of products being sold in a day.

7 Surprising Reasons Turkey Is Entering The War On ISILreddit
The Turkish parliament voted by a large margin Thursday to allow Turkish troops to make incursions into neighboring countries, if necessary, to defeat the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). This authorization is necessary according to the Turkish constitution. Likewise, parliament voted to allow foreign troops involved in the fight against ISIL to be based on Turkish soil. This provision may allow the US to use its Incirlik air force base against the terrorist organization, which Turkey has so far disallowed.
These decisions are a significant turnabout from a month ago, when Turkey seemed reluctant to get involved. What is driving the ruling Justice and Development Party (Turkish acronym AKP) to join the American effort against ISIL?
1. Its European entanglements: Turkey has gotten enormous pressure from President Obama, French president Francois Hollande and UK PM David Cameron to join. For their part, they need the region's largest Sunni country on their side to avoid having the campaign against ISIL look like a Christian-Shiite Jihad against Sunnis. Turkey values its NATO membership and will want to fulfill obligations to other NATO members. President Tayyip Erdogan also very much wants Turkey to be accepted into the European Union, and may figure that proving Turkey's worth in fighting a Muslim extremism that seems threatening to Europe may gain him some good will in the EU. Also, Turkey fears that if the West does manage to inflict attrition on ISIL, the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad might benefit, but Turkey wants to see it overthrown. Being in the coalition allows Turkey to demand that pressure be kept on al-Assad to step down.
2. Turkey has backed the Syrian National Coalition and the Free Syrian Army against the Baathist government of Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. The former two organizations are dominated by a Turkey ally -- the Muslim Brotherhood. (Turkey's own AKP is mildly inflected with a rhetoric of political Islam and just passed a provision allowing middle- and high school female students in state schools to veil, a practice that had been forbidden by 20th century secular governments). In the past couple of years, ISIL has consistently defeated the Free Syrian Army. Turkey wants to build back up the Free Syrian Army "moderate" opposition to both the Baath (socialist Arab nationalist) government in Damascus and extremists like ISIL.
3. Turkey is hoping to persuade the United States to impose a no-fly zone on northern Syria near Turkey. Ankara is convinced that the Syrian Baath government deliberately uses its air power against the Free Syrian Army so as to allow ISIL to win their battles. A no-fly zone would level the playing field, perhaps allowing the FSA finally to make progress and widen its territory. (In my own view, it is highly unlikely that the US will agree to patrol Syrian skies with F-18s, nor would it be legal in international law).
4. Ahu Özyurt argues that Turkey's business classes, which largely back the ruling AKP, fear negative fallout on investment and stock valuation if ISIL continues to be strong and to neighbor Turkey. She says:
"Economically, supporting the anti-ISIL alliance might be Turkey's best bet. With every mortar shell hitting Turkey on Sept. 29-30, the stock market lost points and interest rates increased. Over the weekend, Fitch will most likely downgrade the outlook for Turkey."
5. Newly elected President Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu had feared taking on ISIL this past summer because it had taken hostage some 40 Turkish diplomats at the Mosul consulate. Last week, a deal was reached for the release of the consulate officials and workers. Had they been beheaded by ISIL, it would have deeply harmed the political reputation of Erdogan and Davutoglu. They would have looked helpless and not in control. But now that the hostages have been let go and are out of harm's way, Erdogan and Davutoglu no longer need fear looking like Jimmy Carter during the Iran hostage crisis.
6. Turkey has had fruitful negotiations with separatist Kurds of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) about having the latter cease attacks in Anatolia. The leftist PKK and its Syrian branch, the YPG, is now a major guerrilla force taking on ISIL and was largely responsible for rescuing the Yazidis trapped at Sinjar. The Kurdish town of Kobane is now under siege by ISIL, and PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is warning that if Turkey lets Kobane fall, the PKK will cut off its negotiations with Turkey. (Tens of thousands of Kurds have recently fled into Turkey from Syria in fear of ISIL). Turkey doesn't want to see the PKK and YPG strengthened, as they may be if they can claim sole credit for fighting off ISIL.
7. Tomb of the grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire is in Syria, but is considered Turkish soil. It is guarded by Turkish special ops forces. If it fell to ISIL, that would make Erdogan and Davutoglu look bad, especially since they champion pride in the Ottoman, Muslim heritage of Turkey that had been viewed negatively by previous, secular Turkish governments.

Kerala Muslims now sponsoring sacrificial meat for needful in north IndiaMuslims offer prayers on the occasion of Eid-ul-Zuha on Monday. (Source: Express photo by Gurmeet Singh)
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:31 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 5:26 pm
Muslims in Kerala are now sponsoring hundreds of sacrificial animals to their poor brethren in North and North-Eastern states on the day of Eid.
Various relief and service organisations of different Kerala Muslim sects collect the fund from community members in Kerala and the amount is handed over to co-coordinators in respective states to buy sacrificial animals.
Kerala-based Relief and Charitable Foundation of India, promoted by prominent Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar, has made arrangements to distribute sacrificial meat to 50,000 families in 15 states.
Its all-India coordinator Muhammed Shafi said there are Muslim families in many North Indian villages which would not get sacrificial meat. “In Kerala, even a mahallu with 500 families would be sacrificing 20 to 30 animals on the day of Eid.”
“Kerala Muslim families under such mahallu committees would get huge quantity of meat. Lavishness is tangible with a family of five members, sometimes, getting meat of 5 kg or 10 kg on the day. Hence, we thought to help those people who are not lucky to get sacrificial meat. This time, we have focused on flood-hit Kashmir region,’’ says Shafi.
Shafi said a section of affluent Muslims in Kerala are offering sacrificial animal in Kerala and also outside the state. “Some are sponsoring the sacrificial animal only to our scheme. We want to take two kg of sacrificial meat to a five-member family in the North Indian villages, where the animals sponsored from Kerala would be sacrificed.”
The practice of Kerala Muslims offering sacrificial animals to North Indian states had existed in the past in stray incidents of interventions, but it got an organised nature only in last two years.
“The animal to be scarified would be decided by local leaders in respective states, depending upon the ban on particular animals. In some states, only goat is allowed as sacrificial animal, whereas in other states we are allowed to kill male buffalo,” said Shafi.
Jamaat-e-Islami in Kerala has a Qurbani (sacrifice of livestock) scheme to take sacrificial meat to impoverished Muslim villages in North Indian states. Its coordinator Abdul Latheef Kaloor said their activity targeted 2 lakh families. Last year, 1.75 lakh families had benefited from this offer.
He said instead of offering the animal in Kerala, many are now willing to perform the act in other states. This would ensure that every member of the community gets a share of the sacrificial meat, he said.
Other Muslim segments in Kerala are also engaged in sponsoring sacrificial animal in North India in various extents.

Wal-Mart to expand health insurance role0
Over the past several years, Wal-Mart has moved to expand its reach beyond retail into the health-care sector, where Americans are spending an increasingly larger share of their dollars. Earlier this year, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company began opening primary-care centers at several of its locations. Hundreds of its stores include acute-care clinics that offer a basic menu of services, including flu shots and blood-pressure screenings. Wal-Mart made waves about eight years ago when it announced it would offer generic versions of some prescription drugs for just $4.
Some Wal-Mart competitors are by some measures outdoing the big-box retailer with their forays into health care: CVS, for example, has more than 800 retail clinics, according to consulting firm Merchant Medicine. Walgreens has about 400 of them, while Wal-Mart has about 100.
Wal-Mart first began hosting agents from individual insurers in its stores in 2005. The newly announced offering expands on that, with the agents able to guide customers through thousands of plans from hundreds of carriers. DirectHealth.com agents will receive a commission if they enroll an in-store customer in a health plan.
Diab said Wal-Mart hopes this one-on-one service will become a gateway for customers to come to their stores for all of their health-care needs.
"You're educating the consumer on a very, very complex part of the [health-care] space," Diab said. "And when you do that, they want you to take care of their prescription needs, their over-the-counter needs, their optical needs, the clinics."
The program, known as Healthcare Begins Here, kicks off October 10 and will run in stores through December 7, closely tracking with the Medicare open-enrollment period and partially overlapping with the open enrollment period for federal health insurance exchanges. The company said it will monitor the success of the program and potentially bring it back next year.
Wal-Mart will initially offer the program at 2,700 of its 4,311 U.S. stores. Marcus Osborne, Walmart's vice president of health and wellness payer relations, said the company selected locations based on customer interest and demand.
"We know where Medicare-eligible customers live today, and where there's need for that, and where there are larger numbers of potential customers who could avail themselves of the public exchange," Osborne said.
Wal-Mart's expansion of its health and wellness offerings comes as the company is facing flat comparable store sales and slower foot traffic in its U.S. stores. Price-conscious consumers have been slow to open their wallets, even though the economy is showing steady signs of improvement. Meanwhile, the company is investing heavily in ramping up its e-commerce operation and in building new stores, including in its small-format Neighborhood Markets concept, which it hopes will help create greater opportunities to boost sales.

(The deal's value raised…)
NEW YORK: Facebook has closed its acquisition of mobile messaging service WhatsApp in a deal that is now worth $21.8 billion, up from the original $19 billion deal struck, thanks in part to the social network giant's rising stock price since February.
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook said Monday that it has named WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum to its board of directors. WhatsApp is by far Facebook's largest acquisition, and bigger than any that Google , Microsoft or Apple have ever done.
The deal's value raised eyebrows when it was announced on February 19, though analysts said it makes sense for Facebook to buy the popular messaging service.
WhatsApp has been growing rapidly, especially in Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia. It has more than 500 million users.

Ceasefire violations continue as Pak troops open fire at Arnia  RS Pura sectors; 5 deadPakistan continues to violate ceasefire, kills 5 civilians
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu/New Delhi, October 06, 2014

The Indian government hardened its stance and asked the Border Security Force (BSF) to “retaliate with full force” after five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in firing by Pakistani forces along the border in Jammu on Monday, official sources said.
 
Tensions flared after four Pakistani civilians, including two children and a woman, were killed in retaliatory firing by India as home minister Rajnath Singh and defence minister Arun Jaitley warned Pakistan to stop such attacks if it wanted peace talks with India.
 
“Ceasefire violation must stop. Pakistan must realise that a decisive government has come to power, which will not take such instances lying down,” Singh told HT in an interview.
Read: Pak must realise Modi govt not UPA, says Rajnath Singh
 
India and Pakistan exchanged fire in Arnia and RS Pura sectors late on Monday, the heaviest firing between the two countries since India called off bilateral talks last month. Jaitley said the repeated ceasefire violations would not help normalise relations between the two countries and Indian armed forces were responding to all provocations from across the border.
 
"This is resulting in a series of ceasefire violations as a result of which innocent civilians have lost their lives. Pakistan must realise that the kind of environment it is generating between the two countries is certainly not going to help in normalising relations. The onus of creating a positive environment is on Pakistan which is utterly failing to do so," Jaitley said.

A senior government official told HT on condition of anonymity that border agencies, mainly the BSF and the army, had received instructions to not just match mortar for mortar but “outnumber the number of mortars in retaliation”.
 
“There is no hesitation to our response now. If Pakistan fires five mortars, we can retaliate with 10,” he said.
 
The violence puts more strain on already-tense ties between India and Pakistan after New Delhi called off planned foreign secretary-level talks following the Pakistani ambassador’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders last month.
 
Worst affected by the Pakistani firing in India was Mashain-de-kothe village, where four members of a family were killed. Mortars also landed at Arnia town, about three km from the International Border (IB), forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.
 
“When firing started we thought it would be another routine thing. But when heavy mortars started pounding our homes and heard cries, it was our worst nightmare,” said Soma Devi, a relative of the family that lost four members to the firing.
 
BSF sources said India will not have a flag meeting after the firing which began late last Thursday in a bid to disrupt Dussehra celebrations. Media reports said three militants were killed as the army foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Tangdhar sector.
 
The Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning what it described as India’s “unprovoked firing”.
 
“The government of Pakistan has lodged a strong protest with the government of India through diplomatic channels and called for restraining its forces from constant violation of the ceasefire," it said in the statement.
 
With tension prevailing on the border, the traditional exchange of sweets between Indian and Pakistani troops at the Attari border in Punjab on Eid was called off. However, sweets were exchanged at Chakan-da-bagh area in Poonch.

The healthcare sector has been rife with deal-making  as companies continue to consolidate in the wake of pressure to reduce healthcare costs under Obamacare. The latest: medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson, which is acquiring medical products manufacturer CareFusion. The $12.2 billion cash and stock  deal values CareFusion  at $58 a share.
News of the deal boosted Becton Dickson BDX   8% to $124.98 and CareFusion CFN  23% to $56.75 in heavy trading.
The deal “allows us to align our highly complementary technologies and products to address unmet needs in the growing $20 billion global medication management industry,” says Becton Dickson CEO Vincent Forlenza.
“It accelerates BD’s transition from a product-focused company to a customer-centric provider of innovative healthcare solutions with leading scale across the medication management value chain and expanded solutions for patient safety,” Forlenz said. “With the targeted cost savings we have identified and the growth opportunities we see in bringing CareFusion products to more patients and healthcare workers around the world, we expect this transaction to create meaningful value for our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders.”
About 77% of San Diego-based CareFusion’s sales, including infusion pumps, automated dispensing systems,  surgical instruments and medical surveillance software, are in the U.S., while more than 50% of Becton Dickson’s revenue comes from overseas sales.
Becton Dickson says the merger will  provide double-digit earnings per share growth within the first full year of the merger and $250 million in synergy related cost savings  by 2018.  The companies expect the deal to be completed by mid-2015.
CareFusion was spun off from Cardinal Health  in August  2009. In April, it paid out $40 million to settle  Justice Department allegations over sales and marketing practices over alleged kickbacks to doctors for promoting products not approved by the Food & Drug Administration.
The Becton Dickinson merger could result in a $33.2 million change-of-control payout for CareFusion CEO Kieran Gallahue, according to the company’s annual proxy.
Gallahue, who joined CareFusion in 2011,  received compensation valued at $10.8 million in the latest fiscal year and gained another $18.5 million from vested shares and exercising stock options.

How a pro-rape forum actually brought out the best in RedditAn image from one of Reddit’s grosser forums, “The Philosophy of Rape.” (Reddit)
Reddit hit either a new high or a new low last week, depending on whom you ask.
The source of the division is a quiet, sparsely populated new forum called “Philosophy of Rape”  — a subreddit that, in an introductory post “as serious as a heart attack,” advanced rape and other sexual violence as a “corrective” for women’s “bad behavior.”
Since then, several media outlets have covered the forum, though it hasn’t gained much in the way of actual traction. (As of this writing, it has 55 subscribers, most of whom joined late last week.) Most of those subscribers seem to have joined solely to shout down the concept of “philosophical rape,” or call out the forum’s creator for unforgivable trolling.
“I feel like this should be reported to the FBI,” one user wrote on an early post.
“I actually did already,” another commenter responded. “I had the info for their cyber crimes unit.”
And that’s a heartening response, right? On one hand, r/PhilosophyofRape is an extreme, self-evident example of everything that’s wrong with Reddit and the pseudonymous Web more generally: the lack of moderation or adult oversight; the anarchy; the quiet, fungal flourishing of fundamentally disgusting (even criminal!) chatter; the needless, never-ending trolls. (Because, to be clear, it’s absolutely possible that’s all r/PhilosophyofRape is — an indeterminable game of trolls.)
(Reddit)
But whatever the exact motivations of the forum’s founder, r/PhilosophyofRape has also become a convincing argument for Reddit’s most fiercely held principle: that Internet users, given the agency, can effectively police and govern themselves. We’re so familiar with that philosophy of self-governance failing — the armchair sleuthing/ digital witch hunts , the stolen nude pictures , the doxing and bullying and general abuse — but this is one instance, at least, in which the system worked.
For the uninitiated, here’s a quick rundown of how that system works. On Reddit, users can post to one of many thousands of topical forums, called subreddits. Each subreddit is policed by a moderator or a team of moderators, generally the people who started the subreddit, and they make all the rules. Reddit, the corporate entity, has a few rules of its own, mostly the ones they’re required to uphold by law: no child porn, no copyright infringement, no posting other people’s personal information.
(Reddit)
But generally, Reddit believes, the inmates should get the keys to the asylum. Reddit doesn’t screen posts or forums or proactively monitor content, as a rule. Instead, the site trusts the proverbial crowd to set its own standards and punish users who don’t adhere to them.
“The system has its flaws,” Erik Martin, Reddit’s general manager, told The Post in May . “But it’s a powerful system that for the vast majority of [the Web site] works great.”
That’s a critical policy — and not only as a philosophy on the Internet and the nature of self-governance. Because Reddit is the self-proclaimed “front page of the Internet” — a fair descriptor, given its profound influence on the greater media ecosystem — Reddit’s lack of moderation is arguably responsible for some of the more unfortunate cultural failings of the past couple years, from the misidentification of the Boston bombers (a case that was quietly settled just last week ) to the ongoing Celebgate scandal.
In both the cases, more temperate voices failed to sway the larger forum community. Good/reason did not triumph; Reddit’s overtaxed administrators — there are less than a dozen for a community of more than 3 million registered users — eventually had to step in.
But things seem to be unfolding otherwise in r/PhilosophyofRape. The forum’s inaugural post — a kind of Elliot Rodger-style manifesto — was overwhelmingly voted down by readers, an expression of community disapproval. The most popular comment on the post, left last week, says only “kill yourself. Before it’s too late.” (“I would never [tell] someone to kill themselves,” another user followed up. “This guy, however, needs some sort of divine intervention.”)
(Reddit)
In consequent posts to the forum, readers have pointed out the lack of logic in his arguments, the probability that he’s just a troll, and the best way to report him to police. They have, in other words, done the right thing.
And yet, lest you give humanity too much credit, Reddit still hosts plenty of unpleasant, NSFL and even illegal material: Far from the spotlight of Celebgate, a subreddit called /r/PhotoPlunder trades in the misappropriated nudes of non-celebrity women, most of whom lack the legal resources to get their pictures down. (The subreddit’s moderators claim they only allow photos that women have posted publicly, but when you’re sourcing from anonymous image host Imgur, it’s impossible to tell.) /r/watchpeopledie has nearly 45,000 subscribers; the provenance of the gore therein is frequently unclear. Meanwhile, Reddit has, since 2012, struggled with accusations that the site condones child porn  — and while administrators have made it clear that’s not the case, there’s no question that underage photos have circulated in forums such as /r/youngporn.
Will anyone ever speak up there? Will anyone report those users to police? Thus far, that seems unlikely: /r/PhotoPlunder and /r/watchpeopledie are two years old and popular; /r/youngporn boasts more than 10,000 readers.
Maybe Redditors can indeed be trusted to govern themselves — to be responsible for their own souls , as Reddit chief executive Yishan Wong infamously put it in September. But neither their souls, nor their rules, seem to adhere to any standard code of law or morality. And missing that, Reddit will always be a quicksand of extremes: There’s abject depravity, sure — but there’s also, once in a while, real evidence that even anonymous, lawless people on the Internet can be a force for good.

Nurse in Spain contracts Ebola in first transmission outside AfricaBy Elahe Izadi and Roberto A. Ferdman October 6 Follow @ElaheIzadi Follow @robferdman
Health officials confirmed on Monday that a Spanish nurse, who treated a priest repatriated with Ebola last month, has contracted the virus. (Reuters)
In the first known case of Ebola transmission outside of Africa, a nurse in Spain has contracted the deadly virus after caring for a sick priest who had been flown back from West Africa for treatment, Spanish health minister Ana Mato said at a news conference Monday .
Two tests confirmed the diagnosis of the woman, Mato said. She was part of a medical team treating Manuel Garcia Viejo, the priest who died Sept. 25 of Ebola, according to the BBC .
The infected health worker's only symptom so far is a fever, and her condition remains stable, Mato said. Authorities are trying to determine how exactly she contracted Ebola and whether the team caring for the priest observed proper medical protocols, Mato added.
Ebola is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person exhibiting symptoms.
Authorities are already trying to trace all of the people the health-care worker may have had contact with, said Madrid's primary health-care director Antonio Alemany,  according to the Associated Press . The 30 health care workers who came into contact with her will be under a 21-day period of monitoring, the incubation period for the disease to take hold, NBC news reported .
The nurse worked as a sanitary technician, entering the priest's room once to treat him and one other time to collect his belongings, according to NBC News. She began showing symptoms Sept. 30 and went to a Madrid-area hospital Sunday, AP reported.
There have been more than 7,400 confirmed, suspected and probable cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to World Health Organization figures released Friday . The death toll in the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history has surpassed 3,400.
According to the WHO, "exposure of health-care workers ... continues to be an alarming feature of this outbreak." As of Oct. 1, the WHO said, 382 health-care workers have been infected by Ebola in West Africa; 216 of them have died.

India under-reporting dengue cases:studyPrint
Written by Pritha Chatterjee | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:17 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 9:42 am
India may be grossly under reporting dengue cases. A study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene on Tuesday has found that in the period 2006-12 there were an average of nearly six million cases annually — 282 times the annual average of 20,474 cases reported by the Ministry of Health.
According to the joint study by the INCLEN trust, ICMR, the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare and Brandeis University in Massachusetts, “The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) captures only 0.35 per cent of the clinically diagnosed dengue cases in India”.
CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STUDY
The study analysed retrospective data from 10 medical colleges across five regions of the country and the clinically diagnosed cases in public and private hospitals from a single representative district, Madurai, which was extrapolated to the national level. It also used a Delphi panel, a statistical tool comprising a structured group of experts, to arrive at an estimate of the correct number of clinically diagnosed cases.
The study puts the economic costs of dengue at $1.11 billion or $0.88 per capita and says that 80 per cent of the treatment expenses went to private centres. The study has been funded by Sanofi which, the authors said, was not involved in the process.
According to Dr N K Arora, from the INCLEN trust, who is the corresponding author of the study, “To estimate the total disease burden, first we collected data from all government and private hospitals and nursing homes from a single district to arrive at an adjustment factor on the total number of cases. Based on national data, this factor was then extrapolated to the national level.”
According to Dr Arora, the main reason for this gross under reporting was the absence of private sector data.
The cost of a hospitalised episode in the public sector came to $197.03, and $ 248.11 in the private sector. For ambulatory or out patient treatment, the cost in the public sector was $ 23.49 and $ 26.09 in the private sector.
Senior government officials said the study had also considered suspected dengue cases from the private sector. According to a senior official from the NVBDCP of the Ministry of Health, which supplied the national data for the study, “The study includes reporting from private hospitals, which primarily rely on rapid diagnostic tests. The kits have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. We consider them to be probable or suspected cases and not confirmed ones.”
Explaining that the government had not missed out on this data “entirely”, the official explained, “During this period, while our confirmed cases were over 22,000, the data on suspected cases was four-five times more. Since 2012, most states are also trying to get data from private hospitals”.

Protests for Jaya: Private schools will notshutPrint
Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:12 am
The decision by management associations to close down private schools in the state was withdrawn on Monday following strong criticism from educationists and parents. On Sunday, an association of private schools had announced the closure of their institutes on Tuesday in solidarity with the former CM.
The state school education department that was silent on the decision had reportedly asked the association to withdraw their announcement following criticism.
A statement on Monday evening announced the withdrawal of the decision keeping in the mind the welfare of schoolchildren. Moreover, senior teachers pointed out that a quarterly examination was scheduled for Tuesday.
P B Prince Gajendra Babu, general secretary of the State Platform for Common School System, an organisation that opposed the move to close down the schools said any such decision by a group of individuals or unions is illegal. “A Private body managing a school is only the agent of the government. Principal of a private school can declare a holiday for a school only with a prior approval of the official of education department,” said Babu.
Meanwhile, a group of AIADMK leaders met governor K Rosaiah on Monday evening. Sources in the party said they had sought his help for getting Jayalalithaa transferred to a jail in Tamil Nadu if she is again denied bail.

Kerala Muslims fund Bakrid animals for poor in otherstatesPrint
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:09 am
Muslims in Kerala sponsored hundreds of sacrificial animals for the poor in north and north-eastern states this year on the occasion of Bakrid on Monday. Individual attempts to intervene and sponsor had been reported in the past, but the practice has been organised and streamlined in last two years.
Ahead of the festival, various Muslim relief and service organisations in the state collected funds from the community members and the money was given to coordinators in respective states to buy the sacrificial animals.
Kerala-based Relief and Charitable Foundation of India, promoted by prominent Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar, ma-de arrangements to distribute the sacrificial meat among 50,000 families in 15 states this year. The organisation’s all-India coordinator Muhammed Shafi said there are Muslims families in several north Indian villages which do not get the sacrificial meat.
“In Kerala, even a mahallu with 500 families would be sacrificing 20 to 30 animals on the day of Bakrid.’’
“Kerala Muslim families under such mahallu committees get huge quantities of meat. A family of five members, sometimes gets upto 5 kg-10 kg of meat on the day. Hence, we thought of helping those who are not lucky enough to get the sacrificial meat. This time, we have also focused on the flood-hit Kashmir region,’’ Shafi said.
He added that a section of affluent Muslims are offering sacrificial animals in the state as well as outside it. “Local leaders in respective states will decide upon the animal to be scarified depending upon the ban on particular animals. In some states, only goat is allowed as a sacrificial animal, whereas in other states we are allowed to kill male buffaloes,’’ Shafi said. The Jamaat-e-Islami in Kerala has a scheme called ‘Ourbani’ aimed at taking sacrificial meat to impoverished Muslim villages in north Indian states. Its coordinator Abdul Latheef Kaloor said the scheme targeted two lakh families this year.
Last year, 1.75 lakh families had benefited from it. He said many in Kerala are now willing to perform the sacrifice in other states. It would ensure that every member of the community gets a share of the sacrificial meat, he said.

No headway in Burdwan blastprobePrint
Written by Madhuparna Das , Liz Mathew | Burdwan/new Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:04 am
West Bengal Police has failed to make any major breakthrough in its probe in the Thursday’s explosion at a rented house in Burdwan, and has come under severe criticism for failing to collect intelligence about the bomb manufacturing unit that was in operation for over two months. The probe team has still not established where the large quantity of bombs and explosive materials were headed.
With the two key suspects — Shakil Ahmed and Shobhan Mondal — dead and the third — Abdul Hakim — battling for life in the ICU of Burdwan District Hospital, the investigators are probing the Bangladesh origin of Shakil, believed to be the kingpin of the bomb-making unit.
“We are trying to find if any member of the group had any links with underground outfits in Bangladesh,” said Director General of Police G M P Reddy assuring that the case is being thoroughly investigated.
A report submitted by Burdwan SP on the blast indicated that some members of the group could have links with the Jamat in Bangladesh.
Sources said the investigators are contacting Bangladesh authorities for more details on Shakil’s background. “We are collecting information on his background and verifying his Bangladesh links. In Nadia, we do not have any criminal record against him. But we are interrogating his father-in-law to know more about him,” said SP of Nadia district, Arnab Ghosh.
According to the information gathered by police, Shakil had crossed into India from Bangladesh in 2009 and started staying at Barbakpur village in Karimpur in Nadia district, five km from the international border.
Also known as Shameem and Salim Gazi, he managed to procure Indian voter ID card a year later by introducing his father-in- law Azizul Gazi as his “father”.
According to the CID, Shakil had deep religious moorings and used to deliver speeches in a madrasa in Simulia in Burdwan on issues relating to protection of Muslims in the border areas.
Meanwhile, the CID got the custody of Hassem Mollah, who was arrested from Purbasthali on Sunday. Teams of CID also conducted raids at Simulia, Mangalkot and Purbashthali in Burdwan.
Sketches of two other suspects, identified as Abul Kalam and Kausar, were released and distributed to all police stations across the state.
Amidst the demand for handing over the probe to National Investigation Agency (NIA) by the BJP, a top NIA official said that they have not yet received any order from the Union Home Ministry to visit the spot and take over the probe. “We can visit the spot only if the (Union) Home Ministry issues orders. As of now, we have not received any such instruction,” said IG (NIA) P V Ramasastry.

Professor kills sons  commitssuicidePrint
Express News Service | Hyderabad | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:59 am
An assistant professor working in a private business school killed his two young sons before throwing himself in front of a train near Secunderabad railway station Saturday night. Police found the partially burnt bodies of Vithal (9) and Nandu (5) Monday evening in a pit on a vacant plot owned by Dr Aluru Raghavendra Guruprasad. The 44-year-old was an assistant professor at Icfai Business School in Medchal on the outskirts of the city.
Police suspect that Guruprasad killed his sons Saturday afternoon and tried to burn the bodies unsuccessfully and later buried them in the plot in Kalpataru Residency, located in a deserted area in Medchal. Before committing suicide, Guruprasad wrote a text message on his mobile phone that he killed the boys and buried them in the plot, but did not send the SMS to anyone. Police found the draft message when they checked his phone on Monday morning, and eventually located the plot.
Concerns grew about the well-being of the two missing sons after Guruprasad threw himself before a train Saturday night near Secunderabad Railway Station. He had taken them from his ex-wife’s house before killing himself. Since then, there had been no sign of the boys. Hyderabad Police had launched an inter-state manhunt to locate them, and had sent one team to Guruprasad’s home town Kadapa, but in vain.
Guruprasad, who has authored and co-authored more than 30 scientific publications, and his wife Suhasini got divorced last year.
As per a court order, he was allowed to meet his two sons twice a month for a few hours. He was apparently distraught and angry over not getting enough time with them.

PM used Thackeray as pretext  it wonthelpWarning against any such move, he said, “Nobody should dare to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra, or else 10 crore Marathi people — of the total 11.40 crore population in the state — will not hesitate to take to the streets.”

Raj Thackeray, the MNS president, discusses the Shiv Sena-BJP and Congress-NCP splits, the MNS roadmap, and Narendra Modi. Is it true that Uddhav Thackeray called you soon after the split with the BJP?
Yes. I got a call from Uddhav Thackeray asking about my health. I told him I had a fever, but it was nothing to worry about. What’s so important about it? When Uddhav was unwell and in hospital, I was by his side.
Why didn’t the Sena and MNS forge an alliance?
Uddhav and I did not talk politics. Moreover, the question did not arise as the Sena was in alliance with the BJP until September 24. A new alliance cannot be formed overnight; it has to be worked out in advance. Again, why should I make myself available to the Sena when it wants? Had the Sena-BJP alliance been intact, the MNS would have been their target. I believe in Ekla Chalo Re.
What is your view of the split between the BJP and the Sena?
It was obvious from the beginning that the BJP was going to break the alliance. And if someone couldn’t sense that, they should not be in politics. After the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP was determined to go it alone. For both the BJP and the NCP, it was a well-planned decision. Sharad Pawar had called a senior BJP leader assuring him that if you split, I will take the decision within half an hour. After the Sena and the BJP split, the Congress and the NCP split within 30 minutes.
How do you explain Narendra Modi’s public statement that he will not attack the Shiv Sena as a tribute to Bal Thackeray?
The prime minister used Bal Thackeray as a pretext to explain why they don’t want to attack the Shiv Sena. I don’t think it is going to help them to win support from Sainiks or the people.
Will the split work to Uddhav’s advantage?
After the split, he should have taken a hard posture. After I criticised the BJP for betraying the alliance, Uddhav declared that they would withdraw from the NDA. But the next day he changed the stand. What message are they sending to the people? They are fighting each other in elections, but are in alliance in the BMC (Mumbai’s municipal corporation) and the NDA.
Why is your campaign BJP-centric?
Not at all. I attacked the BJP’s claims of seeking an absolute majority when they have 53 candidates imported from the Congress, the NCP, the Sena or continued…

Close to 21,000 Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel will be recruited
Emphasising on the need for improving basic amenities and passengers’ security, Union Minister for Railways D.V. Sadananda Gowda maintained that the Railway Ministry would focus on the issues by taking up new initiatives and recruiting additional personnel.
Inspecting the premises of Tirupati railway station here Monday, Mr. Gowda said that the government would recruit close to 21,000 (17,000 men and 4,000 women) Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel. “We have received several complaints from the passengers over the safety aspects in trains. Addressing such issues would be our main priority, apart from roping in new technology for minimising accidents,” he said.
Mr. Gowda further said though some regions have been accorded due importance in the past, for the development of railways, the future activities would be undertaken without favouritism to a specific region. “The railways, throughout the country, will be treated as a single unit and there will be no difference between zones and divisions,” he maintained.
Referring to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Railways, Mr. Gowda termed it as a necessity as the Ministry had been functioning with a meagre budget. “My predecessors have announced developmental projects to the tune of Rs. 5 lakh crore, whereas the income of railways is quite less. “Development will be taken forward by seeking assistance of private entities in building infrastructure, through FDI. The operations will, however, remain with the railways,” he said.

For clarity on Hong Kong
Hong Kong
Hong Kong has been rocked by a spate of student-led protests that have swept across the city’s sensitive financial, administrative and shopping hubs. The agitation has sharply brought into focus the “one country-two systems” policy that defined Hong Kong’s transition from an erstwhile British colony to a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The protesters are clamouring for full democracy, that includes open nomination of candidates for the post of Chief Executive (CE) of the territory in the elections scheduled for 2017. Their protests have acquired a sharp and emotive edge after Beijing was accused of reneging on its commitment to premise the entire electoral process from 2017 on universal suffrage, including the choice of candidates for Hong Kong’s highest office.
The high-profile protests that could, if they get prolonged, threaten Hong Kong’s status as one of Asia’s premier financial centres need to be analysed in their fuller context. During the entire period of British rule — a full 155 years following the Opium Wars — democratic advancement in the territory was minimal. Post-1997 under Chinese sovereignty, the democratic reform process has begun to take shape, based on the Basic Law adopted by China in 1990. Under its terms, the CE would be elected by universal suffrage in 2017; but a committee would also be formed that would supervise nominations. While the agitating students, seeking unconditional democracy, may be unhappy with this law, the accusation that Beijing has reneged on its legal obligations is entirely flawed. It is highly unlikely that despite the considerable force of the social media at their command and the sizeable mobilisation on the streets, the protesters will manage to persuade Beijing to change its mind on the fundamentals of its “one country-two systems” policy, which allows the people of Hong Kong to retain their distinctive legal and political system. Yet, Beijing may seriously consider addressing other aspects of alienation in Hong Kong, including the dislocation of identity because mainlanders, prospering from China’s economic boom, establish businesses in Hong Kong, elbowing out sections of the locally entrenched elite from their vantage positions. Besides, skyrocketing property prices are causing people, in some cases, to spend nearly 70 per cent of their incomes on mortgage payments, dimming hope for a bright future, especially among young people. While it may be inclined to stick to its guns, a better-represented nominating committee, not shy of either holding extensive consultations or allowing more open-minded candidates to enter the electoral fray, may serve the immediate purpose of correcting the democratic imbalances that have been exposed by the protests.

China begins building largest hydropower station in Tibet

(The first generator is expected…)
BEIJING: China has started building its largest hydropower station over the Yalong river in Tibet today to tap the rich water resources in the southwest of the plateau.
The hydropower station, which straddles the Yalong River in Sichuan's Ganzi Tibetan autonomous prefecture, has an installed generating capacity of three gigawatts with a total reservoir capacity of 10.8 billion cubic metres, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
The first generator is expected to come into service at the end of 2021 and the entire station is to be completed in 2023.
The Yalong is a tributary of the Yangtze River. Its source originates from the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau in southeast Qinghai, and its confluence with the Yangtze is in Panzhihua in southwestern Sichuan.
China has reported to have built about 23 dams of different sizes on the same river.
China also plans to construct huge dams over the Brahmaputra river in Tibet which has raised concerns in India.
A subsidiary of the State Development and Investment Corporation is in charge of the construction and management of the new hydropower station over Yalong river, Xinhua reported.
The hydropower station is among a string of hydroelectric installations that have been built or will be built along the Yalong River.
They are planned to supply electric power to China's southwest regions as well as eastern areas.

Martin Feldstein: Why the Fed will go fasterMartin Feldstein: Why the Fed will go faster
Martin Feldstein |  Oct 06, 2014 09:50 PM IST
The United States Federal Reserve has emphasised that its monetary policy will be determined by what economic indicators show. But it would require some extremely unlikely data to change the Fed's implicit plan to end its purchases of long-term assets (so-called quantitative easing) in October 2014 and to start raising the federal funds rate from its current near-zero level sometime in the first half of 2015.
The financial markets are obsessed with anticipating whether rates will rise in March or June. Although my own best guess is that the Fed will start to raise rates in March, the starting date is less important than the pace of the rate increase and where the rate will be by the end of 2015.
There is a substantial range of views among the members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The midpoint of the opinions recorded at most recent FOMC meeting implies a federal funds rate of 1.25-1.5 per cent at the end of 2015. Even by the end of 2016, the midpoint of the range is less than three per cent.
In my judgment, such rates would be too low. At a time when inflation is already close to two per cent or higher, depending on how it is measured, the real federal funds rate would be at zero at the end of 2015. Instead of ensuring price stability, monetary policy would be feeding a further increase in the inflation rate.
Although it is possible to argue about the precise appropriate level of the fed funds rate, the Fed's own analysis points to a long-term rate of about four per cent when the long-term inflation rate is two per cent. The most recent value of the consumer price index was up 1.7 per cent year on year, and the 12-month figure would have been even higher but for the anomalous decline in the most recent month. In the second quarter of this year, the annualised inflation rate was four per cent.
The Fed prefers to measure inflation by the price index for personal consumption expenditure (PCE). Its relaxed attitude about inflation reflects its focus on the longer-term past, with PCE inflation at just 1.5 per cent for the 12 months to August of this year, the same as the "core" PCE inflation rate, which excludes food and energy. But PCE inflation has also been rising, with the most recent quarterly value at 2.3 per cent year on year in the April-June period.
So if price stability were the Fed's only goal, the federal funds rate should now be close to four per cent. The Fed's rationale for continuing its ultra-easy monetary policy is that its "dual mandate" requires it to be concerned with employment as well. Its monthly statements emphasise that there is still "a significant underutilization of labor resources", reflecting not only the 6.1 per cent unemployment rate, but also the millions of part-time employees seeking a full-time job and those who are not officially counted as unemployed because they are not actively looking for work.
The Fed is certainly correct that current labour-market conditions imply significant economic waste and personal hardship. But economists debate the extent to which these conditions reflect a cyclical demand shortfall or more structural problems that a monetary stimulus cannot remedy. A recent study by a team of Fed economists concluded that nearly all of the current decline in the labour-force participation rate reflects the aging of the population and other structural causes.
Recent research also indicates that increases in demand that would cause a further reduction in the current unemployment rate would boost the inflation rate. An important study co-authored by Alan Krueger of Princeton University, who served as Chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors until last year, showed that the inflation rate reflects the level of short-term unemployment (lasting less than six months), rather than the overall unemployment rate. Longer-term unemployment implies a waste of potential output and a source of personal suffering, but it does not have an impact on the rate of inflation.
Mr Krueger's analysis indicates that the rate of inflation begins to increase when the short-term unemployment rate falls to 4-4.5 per cent. With short-term unemployment currently at 4.2 per cent, the inflation rate is indeed rising, and Mr Krueger's research suggests that it will increase further in the months ahead.
Similar studies by Robert Gordon of Northwestern University and by Glenn Rudebusch and John Wiliams of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank point to the same conclusion about the role of short-term unemployment and the irrelevance of long-term unemployment in the inflation process. While not all researchers agree with this analysis, I think the evidence is strong enough to represent a warning to the Fed and to market participants.
Indeed I would not be surprised by a continued rise in the inflation rate in 2015. In that case, the Fed is likely to raise the federal funds rate more rapidly and to a higher year-end level than its recent statements imply.

Ajit Balakrishnan: The other e-commerceAjit Balakrishnan: The other e-commerce
Ajit Balakrishnan |  Oct 06, 2014 09:44 PM IST
Indians are ecstatically buying mobile phones, apparel, and innumerable other goods and services online at knock-down prices. The first stage of e-commerce, in which wholesalers are disintermediated and retailers swarm to buy their supplies online, has arrived - with more than half a million transactions happening every day fuelled by more than $2 billion of foreign capital that has poured into the industry.
Yet this type of e-commerce is, in the broader scheme of things, a relatively frivolous part of the overall promise of the Information Age; the bigger promise is making high-quality healthcare and education more affordable and available to all citizens. This is its really worthwhile promise.
Late last year, the American analyst Mary Meeker, speaking at an international conference, estimated the percentage of Indians who have at least a basic form of internet access as 11 per cent of our population. This figure, termed the internet penetration percentage, is 78 per cent for the United States. Russia, she estimates at 48 per cent, China at 43 per cent, Brazil at 45 per cent and even Indonesia at 23 per cent. What is coming in India's way?
The first obstacle to a greater spread of the internet in India is cost. The next hundred million possible users of the internet in India today work as shop assistants, or as hawkers, or as street vendors, and earn less than Rs 9,000 a month, according to the report, How India Earns Spends and Saves, from the National Council of Applied Economic Research. An affordable internet connection for them means one priced at less than Rs 100 a month, always-on and unlimited usage.
Why are internet connections so expensive in India? When I send an email from my phone from my home in Colaba, Mumbai, to a friend in Mahim in central Mumbai, see the path the email traverses: from my phone via spectrum to the nearest cellphone tower (in Colaba), then from the base of the cell tower via underground cable to the base of a cell tower in Mahim, then via undersea cable to the United States to my friend's email service provider's facility; a response from there traverses all the way back via undersea cable to a landing point in Mumbai, then travels by underground cable to a cell tower in Mahim and then via spectrum to my friend's phone. His responses to me have to travel the same tortuous path. All this intercontinental travel adds up the cost. In addition, if there was fibre-optic cable underground infrastructure and a system of internet exchanges in India that covered all our major cities, my email message would have travelled via local wi-fi through this fibre-optic channel and back, all within India.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), as early as 2010, pointed all this out in a consultation paper. Its main recommendation was that a National Optic Fibre Agency be set up and at a cost of Rs 65,000 crores a fibre-optic network be laid across the country as a public utility. Since then, Bharat Broadband Network, the entity that will execute this plan, has come into existence and pilot projects have been undertaken in Ajmer in Rajasthan, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Panisagar in Tripura. Similarly, a National Internet Exchange (NIXI) has come into being with traffic exchange points in the seven largest cities in India.
The other day, on a trip to Bangalore, I checked the path that an email I sent on my phone took to reach my office in Mumbai. And here it is: Bangalore-Delhi-London-Newark-New York-Palo Alto-Tokyo-Singapore-Chennai-Hyderabad-Delhi-Mumbai.
I suspect that between Trai's noble goal as expressed in its 2010 recommendations and reality there lies India's political economy. Telecom companies, internet service providers, and application and content providers have been reluctant to peer with each other at NIXI. Enforcing this peering and swiftly executing the visionary national optic-fibre plan does not appear to be on anybody's policy agenda.
It was Thomas Birkland in his book An Introduction to the Policy Process who pointed out that in political decision-making something can be seen to be a condition about which nothing much can be done, or it can be seen to be a problem about which something can be done. For example, young children being made to work in factories was for a long time seen to be a social condition about which nothing could be done, till public opinion changed and it began to be seen as a problem. Once this change of perception happened, no doubt because of the work of social activists, laws against child labour were enacted, firm public action was initiated against employers who used child labour. I wonder what it will take to get India's poor broadband penetration to be seen as a problem and not as a condition. And enable real, serious e-commerce to take off in India.

Lanco: Fighting a grim battleLanco: Fighting a grim battle
Dev Chatterjee | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 12:45 AM IST
In August, Hyderabad-based Lanco Infratech sold its Udupi power plant to Adani Power at an enterprise valuation of Rs 6,000 crore. The move was aimed at reducing Lanco's debt ofRs 36,700 crore. While Lanco is to receive Rs 2,000 crore in cash, Adani Group will take over debt of Rs 4,000 crore.
But analysts say this isn't enough for Lanco to get out of the debt trap. Most of the company's projects are facing litigation relating to fuel supply, cost of generation and/or off-take disputes, apart from rising interest payments on its loans.
"We believe issues of cash-flow crunch are unlikely to be resolved in the near term, despite the Udupi stake sale and CDR (corporate debt restructuring) being approved, as these will only help put equity in stuck, under-construction projects. In the medium-to-long term, problems due to projects facing issues of fuel security or non-viable power purchase agreements will emerge," Emkay Research analyst Amit Golcha said in a report dated August 18. "We do not see a significant upside unless clarity emerges on fuel supply, especially for merchant/gas plants, offtake and offtake disputes, and debt reduction."
This is bad news for Lanco's investors, who were expecting the company to turn around, in line with the overall economy, owing to a stable, pro-business government at the Centre. Since January this year, the company stock has fallen 17 per cent; in the past five years, it has declined 98 per cent.
And, the company's mounting debt is eating into its cash flow. In 2013-14, the company paid interest of Rs 2,762 crore, while its operating profit stood at Rs 1,449 crore. In 2012-13, operating profit was Rs 2,665 crore, while interest payment stood at Rs 2,421 crore, showing the company's inability to generate enough money to repay its loans in recent years. In 2013-14, the company's debt-to-equity ratio was 25.18, compared with 9.26 in 2012-13; in 2012-13, its return on equity was a negative 22.74 per cent.
Issues before Lanco
In a statement in September, the company admitted it was in financial woes, and was taking steps to raise funds. Citing the micro-economic environment in the past three years, Lanco said it couldn't raise funds either through an initial public offering or a qualified institutional placement, as initially planned.
"Lanco plans to sell 3,000 Mw of assets to raise Rs 5,000 crore and reduce additional debt of Rs 15,000 crore," the company had said. It added the financial health of state government-owned electricity distributors should be improved on a priority basis so that they could pay power generation companies.
But analysts aren't enthused by these arguments. "For Lanco, we believe the issue of cash flow crunch is unlikely to be resolved in the medium term, given most projects are likely to be under stress. Cash flow from the Udupi deal and CDR will merely postpone the issue," they say.
Trouble Down Under
During the quarter ended June, the production of Griffin Coal, Lanco's Australian subsidiary, hit a low of 0.61 million tonnes (mt), down 25 per cent year-on-year.
Lanco had acquired Griffin Coal for $605 million (A$750 million) in 2011.
Initially, it was planned Griffin Coal's production would be increased to five mt a year. However, since Lanco acquired the company, its production has declined 40 per cent. Since then, it has also been losing money, following depreciation and interest expenses, according to stock exchange data.
"The coal production is controlled to the extent of local market requirement," a company spokesperson said in an emailed response.
In the past, the company had said it would sell part of its stake in Griffin. But owing to low valuations, it has decided to postpone the sale. After the surge to almost Rs 15 in May this year from its all-time low of near Rs 5 in August 2013, Lanco's stock is back to below Rs 7 levels currently. In this scenario, it may not be easy to raise significant money via the equity route without sizeable equity dilution. As such, the wait for investors to expect a turnaround in Lanco's fortunes has been extended.

SC panel suggests steps to regulate govt advertisingPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:43 am
Advocating strict regulation of expenditure and content of advertisements in the media by governments and politicians, a Supreme Court panel has recommended a slew of measures to “keep politics away” from such ads to check “misuse and abuse” of public money.
The court-appointed high-powered committee stated that only pictures and names of the President, Prime Minister, Governors and Chief Ministers should be published in government advertisements without mentioning or using names and pictures of political parties and their office bearers.
Headed by eminent academician Professor N R Madhava Menon, the three-member panel suggested ways to prevent splurge of the public fund. The panel said expenditure on public advertisements should be declared by each ministry and public sector undertaking and that it should be audited by the CAG.
The report suggested there be an implementation committee, headed by either an ombudsman or Cabinet Secretary or Secretary Information and Broadcasting Ministry, to maintain a distinction between legitimate message of government from that of political message till a law is enacted.
It said government advertisements should not be used to the advantage of the ruling party and for assailing the opposition. It also endorsed a suggestion by the Election Commission that there must be severe restrictions on such advertisements six months prior to elections.
The committee, comprising T K Viswanathan, former Secretary General of Lok Sabha and Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, recommended that there should only be a single advertisement, preferably by the I&B Ministry, in respect of commemorative advertisements that are published on birth and death anniversaries of important personalities.
The committee prepared its guidelines after consulting provisions of various countries and meeting all state governments and political parties.
Based on these recommendations, the SC will issue “substantive guidelines” to be followed by the central and state governments and their agencies such as the Directorate of Advertising and
Visual Publicity (DAVP) and information departments in states.
Approving curbs on “politically motivated” advertisements by governments and leaders at the cost of public funds, the SC had in April set up a panel to frame comprehensive guidelines to help end the abuse of public ads for political mileage. It will take up the case next on October 9.

Former minister Sao was arrested from house of human traffickerPrint
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Hazaribagh | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:38 am
Former Jharkhand Agriculture Minister Yogendra Sao, who was arrested in Delhi on Saturday, was reportedly hiding in the house of an alleged human trafficker who has at least one arrest warrant pending against him.
Sao, a Congress MLA from Barkagaon, was arrested on a non-bailable warrant issued against him by a Hazaribagh court. The warrant was issued after the leader of a banned outfit told the police that the minister had given him money, guns and bikes to begin his group, ‘Jharkhand Tiger’. Later, the arrested leader of another group — Jharkhand Bachao Andolan — also told the police that Sao supported his organisation.
On Saturday, when Jharkhand’s CID and the Delhi Police came to arrest Sao in Shakurpur’s J J Colony, the alleged human trafficker, Pannalal Mahto, was at home. The police teams reportedly interacted with him, but CID personnel did not arrest him.
The police said the team was not aware of Mahto’s antecedents. “The CID team was not aware that this man had one or two warrants out against him. They will go back to arrest him,” DGP Rajeev Kumar said, without giving a timeline for the arrest.
Baidnath Kumar of NGO Diya Seva Sansthan, however, contradicted the DGP’s claims, saying that the CID had contacted him beforehand for Mahto’s details. Kumar’s NGO meticulously documents human trafficking cases in the state and has earlier been consulted by the CID for data.
Aradhna Singh, the officer in-charge of Khunti district’s anti-human trafficking unit, has confirmed that there are four cases pending against Mahto. “The warrant against him and his wife Sunita Devi was obtained only ahead of (Durga) Puja and we were preparing to conduct a search operation,” the sub-inspector said.
“He runs his activities in the name of Pannalal Placement Agency, located opposite Subash Place police station in Delhi. He has always been a major trafficker, but his name would not come up in FIRs because he is well-connected,” Singh said.

NYT says sorry for Mars cartoonExpress News Service | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:36 am
The New York Times has apologised for a cartoon on India’s Mars Orbiter Mission, following criticism that it insulted India. The cartoon — which showed a rustic farmer leading a cow by a rope knocking on the door of an ‘Elite Space Club’ through whose window two western gentlemen wearing suits can be seen lounging on couches — was panned for being racist and for stereotyping Indians.
The cartoon was carried with an article titled ‘India’s Budget Mission to Mars’, a reference to the frugality of the Mission, which was achieved at a tenth of the cost of NASA’s Maven, which entered the Martian orbit just ahead of Mangalyaan.
“A large number of readers have complained about a recent editorial cartoon in The International New York Times, about India’s foray into space exploration. The intent of the cartoonist, Heng Kim Song, was to highlight how space exploration is no longer the exclusive domain of rich, Western countries,” Andrew Rosenthal, Editorial Page Editor, wrote on The New York Times’s Facebook page.
“Mr. Heng, who is based in Singapore, uses images and text — often in a provocative way — to make observations about international affairs. We apologize to readers who were offended by the choice of images in this cartoon. Mr. Heng was in no way trying to impugn India, its government or its citizens. We appreciate that readers have shared their feedback, which we welcome,” Rosenthal wrote. Heng is a veteran cartoonist whose work has appeared in a large number of publications over the past three decades. His cartoons focus on a wide range of international news events, and on leaders from Barack Obama to Xi Jinping.

One simple trick to see if earnings will be goodThis one simple trick, discovered by a doctor, tells you if earnings will be good or bad

Do you want to know if a company’s earnings will be good or bad? Of course you do. And this one simple trick, discovered by a doctor, will help you do it.
Michael Probst, AP
No, really. The doctor in question, Eric So, holds a doctorate in business administration from Stanford, so he’s someone you should listen to in financial matters. And the simple trick really is pretty simple.
The indicator you should watch: Whether or not a company changes its earnings reporting date, and whether than change moves the date forwards or backwards.
Not surprisingly, if the date moves up, the news is usually good. If it moves back? Probably not good. Professor So, who is the Sarofim Family Career Development Professor and an assistant professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. says the simple rule is human nature. People rush home to tell their families good news, and tend to keep quiet about bad news.
Professor So looked at eight years’ of earnings announcements – 19,000 firms between 2006 and 2013. Firms that move up their announcements earn 2.6% more than the firms that delay announcements over the month following earnings calendar revisions.  “The magnitude of this mispricing is massive,” So said in a statement.
He said he believes that investors overlook the significance of the date shifting because it is typically announced as a simple calendar listing. “It comes across as a boilerplate disclosure that doesn’t appear to contain information about the nature of the news, only when the news is to be announced,” he said.

Code and cupcakes: A woman developer gives back to moms  daughters2
While still in her hometown, she said, she started a computer-science degree and taught herself HTML. After leaving Alliance in 2006 with an unfinished degree, she said, she found work as a developer and designer and started the Columbus, Ohio, chapter of Girl Develop It, a non-profit provider of Web development courses for adult women. In the spring of 2013, she moved to Chicago to teach at Dev Bootcamp, a coding school.
Now she is a freelancer, a situation that gives her more time for passion projects like Code and Cupcakes, she said.
A single mother, Myers said she had put her undergraduate degree on hold due to strained finances and parenting responsibilities. Now, with some experience, she’s working to complete her bachelor’s in computer science at DePaul University.
Myers said she wants to make Code and Cupcakes available to anyone with an interest. She said skills like coding can change someone’s life.
“The opportunity to learn about technology and how to use it did open up opportunities to make our lives better,” Myers said.
Myers said not growing up with advanced technology gives her a unique appreciation for it. The same can’t be said for her daughter, whose appreciation for technology stems from understanding how to create and build with it. 
The program is open to girls as young as 7, though teenagers might benefit more from the lessons, Myers said. Either way, she said, young people should be more interested in producing technology than simply consuming it.
“It really worries me that they don’t know how to create it,” Myers said. “That means everything they’re consuming is being created by other people.”
Myers said she wants to instill a desire to create and that she hopes to expand the scope and frequency of the program. She said Chicago offers little of this type of access and education.
“I don’t see how we can continue to progress and innovate if we’re stifled in terms of the people who know how to create,” she said.

Joe Walsh and Kent Frayn were roommates at the University of Illinois when they came up with the idea for DropCatch, a magnetic bottle opener that not only lifts caps but also magnetically stores up to 60 of them on the same wood device. Now 24-year-old alumni, they’ve raised nearly $50,000 on Kickstarter and are selling the DropCatch for $60 apiece, with wood crafted in Logan Square and assembly in the West Loop. John Carpenter found them a perfect fit for his series on Chicago Makers. “It’s a conversation piece,” Walsh told him.

How to get more women into coding? Jen Myers, a designer and developer, will host workshops to teach mother-daughter pairs the basics. “I know what it’s like to not have access to these type of things,” Myers told Amina Elahi. “There’s always this sense of if I had this earlier, I could be farther now, or maybe it would’ve been easier earlier in my career.” Her teaching assistant at Code and Cupcakes will be her 9-year-old daughter Elizabeth.
Jamie Hodari and Justin Stewart opened Industrious, a coworking space in Chicago, a year ago, with quirky antiques and creaky wood floors adding charm beyond cubicle style. “Everything good is unexpected in the office context,” Hodari told James Janega. (That gives me the sads. Let’s fix that.) “No one expects even the barest moments of warmth or hospitality, so moments matter in that context.” It’s one of a handful of lessons Hodari and Stewart think they can take on the road as they prepare to expand their brand to Atlanta, Philadelphia, Brooklyn and St. Louis.
A hybrid work-and-workout facility set to open in December in the West Loop will be the first Midwest facility from Brooklyn Boulders, a New York-based indoor rock-climbing company. “It’s loud, it’s dusty, it’s gritty, it’s kind of almost obnoxious, to the point that people really love it,” community developer Jesse Levin said. (Sounds kind of like a newsroom.) It will include a 1,000-square-foot collaborative workspace with standing desks, exercise-ball sitting desks and above-desk pull-up bars. The goal: to meld physicality with productivity.
Innovative alternative food sources always raise attention; fortunately, we don’t have to eat this one, at least not directly. Inc. reports on Dayton, Ohio-based EnviroFlight and its effort to turn black soldier fly larvae into a low-cost, high-protein feed for livestock. First, founder Glen Courtright had to get the insects to mate in captivity en masse. (I KNOW.) “When they mate, they move in tail to tail,” he explains. “You know it’s working if you see them drop. Boop, boop. It looks like little black rain drops.” Believe it or not, it gets more dramatic from there.

Portage Park earns historic bungalow district designation0
"There is a changing of the guard, and there are young people buying them," said Mary Ellen Guest, the association's executive director. "They either are really preserving them or they know that the shell is marvelous and they are modernizing the entire inside.
"We are very supportive of both of those" projects, she continued. "We are not the bungalow police. One of the beautiful things of these homes is they are adaptable, and people are adapting them for each generation."
Armrhad Johnson is among that new generation of bungalow owners intent on preserving the past. As a first-time homebuyer, he bought a three-bedroom, one-bath bungalow in the city's Auburn Gresham community in 2009 and tackled its interior.
The stairs to the attic were relocated from the bathroom to an addition built at the back of the house. The electrical system was upgraded. The brick fireplace, painted white, was blasted with baking soda, and despite the five hours of mess, attractive pale brick was discovered underneath. The shag carpet in the living and dining rooms was pulled up to reveal the original wood floors, with sections of a newspaper from the 1940s stuck to it. The floor was then refinished.
In 2011, Johnson and his wife, Cicely, received the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation bungalow award for the best interior restoration of a Chicago bungalow. In 2012, the neighborhood's bungalow district was listed on the national register.
"Even if my house wasn't to become part of the historic district, I wanted to keep the history alive," he said. "I just wanted the comfort of knowing everything is done right and everything is historically preserved. From what I hear, these houses will last another 100 years."
To help preserve, update or make the homes more energy efficient, the association maintains a resource and referral list that includes more than 350 companies vetted by the association. Companies cannot pay to be on the list.
To offer more help, the bungalow association is sponsoring the Chicago Bungalow and Vintage Home Expo at two locations in the next six months: Oct. 25 at the Jacoby D. Dickens Center at Chicago State University on the South Side, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., and March 7 at an undetermined location on the North Side. The event, which will include workshops, demonstrations and face-to-face mini-consultations with residential architects, is free.
Last month, more than 100 people attended a seminar about expanding bungalow attics.
"We think this trend of folks really wanting to learn how to work on their homes is really good news for city neighborhoods," Guest said.
The Portage Park district, bounded by West Pensacola Avenue, North Lockwood Avenue, West Hutchinson Street and North Central Avenue, includes 189 historic bungalows built from 1915 to 1930, as well as other bungalows, two-flats and brick garages.
The association will mail letters to each home in the new district to make them aware of the designation and what it means. It does not mean homeowners are prevented from making changes to their homes.
In fact, to be eligible for an eight-year property tax freeze on a district home, owners have to undertake renovations that are valued at 25 percent of the home's market value.
Forty years ago, Annette Ledermann and her family moved into a 1927 corner bungalow in Portage Park, paying $49,000 for the home. She has found that trying to keep an old house intact is expensive, but looking back, she's so glad she resisted making major changes.
Guests still "ooh and "ahh" over the art deco bathroom with its big mirror, the kitchen with its metal cabinets, the original light fixtures, stained-glass windows and plastered cove ceilings.
"These homes aren't being made anymore, and they have all the bells and whistles and they're so strong," Ledermann said. "All of these houses around here have such style and personality."

The Explosion of Crayon Colors Since 1903This article originally appeared in Business Insider .
First invented in 1903 , the original Crayola box contained only eight colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, and black. It sold for only a nickel.

A  chart posted on Reddit  shows how Crayola crayon colors have grown from eight basic hues to dozens in a little over 100 years.
Now, there are 120 colors in the Crayola color wheel. The names have evolved as well to include colors like “denim,” “screamin’ green,” “dandelion,” and “razzle dazzle rose.”
Stephen Von Worley , a visualization researcher at Data Pointed , created the  visual crayon chronology with his pseudonymous friend who he calls "Velociraptor." They used Wikipedia’s list of Crayola colors and added the standard 16-count crayon box released in 1935 for schools to create the beautiful graphic.
The pair also figured out that the average growth rate of crayon colors was 2.56 percent annually, meaning that the number of colors doubles every 28 years.
So by 2050, our future children could be coloring with 330 different colored crayons.
You can see an interactive version of the so-called “ Crayon-Bow ” at Von Worley’s Data Pointed website that allows you to scroll over to see the crayon names.

Consciously Designing Your Ideal Businessreddit
A couple weeks ago, I wrote about the importance of designing your business around your life in my article "Is Your Business Taking Over Your Life?" It's so easy to allow your work to consume you to the point where you have little time or energy left to live the life you truly desire.
If you are working 70-80 hours, it's going to be hard to fit your life in around the edges of that.  So, it's essential to step back and take stock of what your ideal life would look like, so you can make sure your business supports what you really want.
Now, once you've consciously envisioned the life you desire, it's time to consciously design your ideal business.  From my perspective, this begins by defining the powerful difference you are passionate to make through your life and business.
Who do You want to Positively Impact - and How?
This is the key not only to your happiness in your business, but also to the revenue and profits you'll generate. Think of this as your true north, the right direction both for your life and for the business in which you will be the most successful.
When you are excited about how you are helping others, the difference you are making in their lives, you will become highly motivated to do whatever it takes to succeed. You will also attract the right customers, the ones who are strongly attracted to being helped by you.
Why? They seek the solutions you offer to their problems and the specific manner in which you meet their needs. You will also attract the right business partners, those who are aligned with your vision and priorities.
So, what is the overarching purpose or vision for your business?  Thought of differently,  what would be missing in your customer's lives if your business didn't exist? What specific and value does your business provide your customers or clients?
What is the #1 Value You Provide Customers?
Once you've identified the difference you want to make, it's time to envision your market niche. They either have a problem you can solve or a need you can fill. Problems show up in two ways: either something your customer wants to get rid (and the negative emotions they associate with it) of or a dream they seek to achieve (and the positive feelings they seek to magnify in their life.)
While a specific problem, such as weeds in the garden, needs a solution for getting rid of the weeds, a need is a deeper. Think of a need as an area of their life or business that requires information, training, or new skills. Examples of needs include: knowing how to consciously build a business or how to save and invest the money needed for retirement.
What does your ideal customer look like? How old is your typical customer? Are they male or female? What are their struggles, needs, interests, and desires? What problems can you solve for them? What needs can you fill?
Utilize information such as this to develop a robust picture of your ideal customer. This is call your customer Avatar. Understanding the products and services that your Avatar wants, at what price, and how they want to consume the products and services is the foundation for the financial success of your business.
Drill Down to Understand Your Customer.
Think of Las Vegas a few years back when they tried to pitch their city as a "family vacation spot."  They really missed their Avatar on that one and their economy suffered. These days they send the message that Vegas is the place for "adults who want to have naughty fun" -- a message that really speaks to their niche and what they offer. While this isn't the highest conscious difference, that isn't what Las Vegas is aiming to be for others.
How are you going to know all this information? How are you going to know what your clients and customers want, what form they want it in, and what they want to pay for it? The most simple and direct way is this -- ask them. If you already have a business, talk to your customers.
If you are planning a business, connect with and have conversations with people who are interested in what you are passionate about providing and see what they want, how they want it, and what they are willing to pay for it. You can do this in-person, through online research, and with surveys.
Once you have that information from your prospects or existing customers, revisit what you are excited about and see where that converges with your market. Out of all your customers problems and needs, what are YOU most excited about providing? This is the heart-pumping lifeblood of your ideal business. It's what will get you up in the morning with a powerful feeling for what you will accomplish in the day ahead.
What Most Excites You as a Business Owner?
To be highly successful in your business, it's important that your Avatar is someone you relate to, connect with, understand, and enjoy doing business with. If you don't like or relate to your business Avatar, maybe it's time to redesign your business toward the clientele that does excite you and who really wants what you have to offer.
All of this certainly makes sense when you are consciously designing a new business venture, yet it is just as important to consider when you want to revitalize an existing business. All businesses that become growth leaders in their market, have a clear vision of their purpose and how it best relates to their ideal customer. They know exactly which products and services are right -- and at what price. You must as well.
Being a leader in your market niche is a long-term proposition. Running a business in a conscious sustainable manner requires thinking ahead into the future. It includes anticipating the evolving problems and needs of your customers and how these will converge with your long-term vision for how you want to develop and grow your business.
Begin with Your Long-Term Vision - then Stick to It!
Start thinking ahead now. What type of business do you envision owning in three years?
What are the characteristics of your office and the people you work with? How large of an operation do you desire?  How large is your customer base? Size does matter -- and bigger is not always better. Larger operations have different challenges. For example: how do you keep up standards of personalized customer care as you grow beyond what you can personally provide or supervise?
These days there are many options for digital product delivery and virtual operations as well. These can scale more easily and quickly, yet offer less customer interaction, engagement, feedback, and loyalty. What type of interactions do you want you and your business to have with your customers?
How fast do you want to grow? Growing fast is exciting and it brings challenges. Faster is not always better when it comes to quality and sustainability. So what is the right pace for your business to grow?
Especially if you are an early-stage business, growing rapidly should be one of  your primary goals. It is easy to double and triple numbers when you are small. Consider that if you grow at 100 percent, you double each year. If you grow at 28 percent , you double every three years.
If you are a non-venture capital business, that is a privately held business, and don't have a large amount of capital, I suggest that you plan on doubling within three years, which requires 28 percent growth -- while maintaining the awareness that 100 percent or more growth is not only possible, it is attained by many small entrepreneurs. Which brings us to the natural question -- why not you?
How FAST Will You Grow Your Business?
While shooting for something that feels realistic within your current set of beliefs, open you mind to up-shifting your beliefs about what is possible and therefore up-shifting your growth rate as well.
Answering these questions will help you envision the size, structure, and growth rate you want to plan for in your business. Consciously designing your business by always keeping these questions in mind will insure that your business makes a big positive difference in your customer's lives, returns the profits that come from providing that big value, and supports you in living the life you desire.
In my next article, we'll explore your own ideal role in your ideal business and how to choose it, so that you both maximize your business growth and your own personal fulfillment and happiness.
I'd love to hear what has worked well for you in consciously designing your business in our discussion below.

Is a Marine veteran close to being let out of a Mexican jail  or notBy Dan Lamothe October 6 Follow @danlamothe
Marine veteran Andrew P. Tahmooressi, is shown here in Afghanistan with 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines, as he was combat meritoriously promoted to sergeant in February 2012. He has been held in a Mexican jail for more than six months, and was the subject of a congressional hearing last week. (Photo by 1st. Lt. Chris Harper/Marine Corps)
The 911 call recording is filled with confusion. Andrew P. Tahmooressi, a Marine Corps veteran who had recently left active duty after two deployments to Afghanistan, had been pulled over near the Mexican-American border by Mexican authorities. He had taken a wrong turn while carrying guns and ammunition registered in the United States, and was unsure what to do next.
“Hi, I’m having a little bit of an emergency here,” Tahmooressi told the 911 operator March 31. “… I’m at the border of Mexico right now. My problem is, I crossed the border by accident and I have three guns in my truck, and they’re trying to… take my guns from me.”
The veteran, a sergeant in the infantry, added that “I’m not sure if I crossed yet.” He was taken into custody, and has remained imprisoned in Mexico ever since. He attempted to kill himself in April because he was afraid that prison guards would rape and torture him, his mother Jill said.

The Marine’s predicament was the subject of a hearing on Capitol Hill last week. The Marine’s mother was flanked by television personality and veterans advocate Montell Williams and two other friends, and she urged lawmakers to push the authorities in Mexico to release her son from jail. Rep. Ed Royce (R.-Calif.) said that he had spoken recently with Mexican officials and was “confident that a humanitarian release will occur very soon” so the Marine veteran can receive treatment for post-traumatic stress, diagnosed following his deployments to Afghanistan.
That hasn’t occurred yet, however. Jill Tahmooressi told Checkpoint that the case is still proceeding slowly through the Mexican legal system. Authorities overseeing the case could make a ruling in coming weeks; they recently received independent verification from a Mexican doctor that Tahmooressi has post-traumatic stress, a possible step toward his release.
Mexican authorities haven’t yet rested their case against Tahmooressi, a point of frustration for those advocating on behalf of the Marine. A spokesman for his family, Jonathan Franks, said Monday that they “implore” the Mexican attorney general’s office to “to complete the necessary bureaucratic steps to move the case forward.”

The case has become a popular cause for conservative and veteran advocates, who say the U.S. government has not done enough to secure the Marine’s release. But legal experts say the case is complicated because possessing the weapons in Mexico is a serious offense – even if he did declare he had them when he crossed into Mexico and asked for directions back to the United States.
Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary said last week that he was aware a petition asking President Obama to intervene in the situation directly has received more than 100,000 signatures, but he was not ready to say what the White House would do.
Williams attributed Tahmooressi’s arrest to his post-traumatic stress disorder, and said more should be done to secure his release.
“We caused his arrest because we have not treated him appropriately, and we should work with our allies to be as compassionate as we can be to let this young man come home and get the treatment he deserves,” Williams said in an interview, hitting similar themes to comments he made on Capitol Hill last week.
Andrew Bartholomew, who served with Tahmooressi in Afghanistan, said his friend’s treatment in prison has improved greatly since the case began receiving media attention, and he has done his best to remain optimistic that everything will end well.
“I’ve spoken with Andrew over the phone several times since his arrest and he seems to be doing alright,” Bartholomew. “Much better, at least, than I would be doing if I were in his shoes.”

Oral argument in Heien v. North CarolinaBy Orin Kerr October 6
I attended the oral argument this morning in the Supreme Court’s first case of the new Term, Heien v. North Carolina . I had a long preview of Heien here . He are some impressions of the argument.
On the whole, I thought the argument was puzzling. A large chunk of the argument time was spent on Justice Scalia’s insistence that the Court could not render a decision on the rights question alone without also ruling on whether the exclusionary rule was available. I found this odd for two reasons. First, the state had never argued the exclusionary rule. The state’s Brief in Opposition had argued that it would be better to review a different case in which the exclusionary rule issue was also part of the case, a position the Justices presumably weighed before granting cert on just the rights question.
Second, the logic of Davis v. United States is that the Court is free to rule on substantive Fourth Amendment issues even when there is no remedy. It’s fine to consider rights when there are no remedies, Davis concluded, because the two are conceptually distinct questions. More broadly, the Court often rules on one issue and remands for other issues that need to be resolved before we know which side will win. Given that, it was puzzling that so much argument time was spent in Heien considering whether they could decide the rights issue without also deciding the remedy in the same case.
Perhaps the Court will dismiss Heien as improvidently granted and later take a different case in which the exclusionary rule issue is presented? It’s a possibility. But that path would seem pretty puzzling in light of cases like Davis.
In the time not spent considering whether the Court could decide the case, there was a lot of discussion of how a reasonable mistake of law standard would be different from the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule or qualified immunity. Is the proposed standard any different, and if so, how? Both the state and the U.S. suggested that the reasonable mistake of law standard is similar to qualified immunity but doesn’t go as far. The state suggested that there could be a difference if a prosecutor tells the agent that the search is legal, presumably when the prosecutor is relatively straightforwardly wrong. There would be no reasonable mistake of law, as the prosecutor was clearly wrong, but prosecutorial approval could trigger qualified immunity. The U.S. suggested that the reasonable mistake of law standard should be for close calls, unlike qualified immunity that applies unless the error was clear.
How might the Court rule? I’m not at all sure. Justice Kennedy suggested that he would say that the good faith exception applies to the facts of Heien, and that he wanted to reach that issue. Justice Kagan seemed sympathetic to the defense’s argument on the rights issue. Justice Breyer seemed open to allowing a reasonable mistake of law claim if it could be narrow. And a lot of Justices didn’t give any sign one way or the other, perhaps in part there was so much focus on the remedies issue. Given the close connection between rights and remedies in the case, it may not matter which side in Heien wins on the only briefed issue, that of rights. The rights issue isn’t really where the action is, and it’s hard to predict if that means the Justices will give the rights issue to the defense and wait for another case on the exclusionary rule, or, alternatively, import exclusionary rule concepts into the rights issue to resolve the ultimate disposition of such cases now even though the remedies issue isn’t before them.

NEW YORK — Hilton Worldwide says it will sell the storied  Waldorf Astoria New York to the Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group  for $1.95 billion, but the U.S.-based hotel chain will continue to run the legendary property for another 100 years.
"We are very excited to be entering into this long-term relationship with Anbang, which will ensure that the Waldorf Astoria New York represents the brand's world-class standards for generations to come,'' said Christopher Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton Worldwide, in a statement.
As part of the agreement, the Waldorf, a New York City landmark, will undergo a significant renovation.  Money made from the sale will enable Hilton Worldwide, the largest hotel group in the world based on number of rooms, to buy more properties in the USA.
The deal is scheduled to close on Dec. 31, but if that closing time is delayed, the companies must finalize the purchase no later than March 31.
The Waldorf Astoria New York is the flagship for Hilton Worldwide's Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts brand, which has 27 luxury hotels worldwide, and another nine in development. The fabled New York property is the only hotel in the Waldorf chain being sold to Anbang.

Heres what the Ebola epidemic (still) looks like in West AfricaBy Sarah Larimer October 8 Follow @slarimer

Last week, health officials announced the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States . On Wednesday, the patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, died in a Dallas hospital .
Since the first U.S. diagnosis, an American freelance journalist was stricken with Ebola; he was repatriated from Liberia and is now receiving treatment in Nebraska . There have been scares in the  Washington area , South Florida and Newark, N.J., as fears of infection worsened.
And a Spanish nurse who was treating an Ebola-stricken priest became infected herself , in the first case of Ebola transmission outside of West Africa.
But as the attention shifted to U.S. concerns and the situation in Europe, the death toll has continued to rise in West Africa, where medical teams are still scrambling to contain the deadly virus.
UNICEF estimates at least 3,700 children in West Africa have lost one or both parents to Ebola since the outbreak began this summer. These three siblings in Monrovia struggle to get by together. (AP)
There are now more than 8,000 confirmed, suspected and probable cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to World Health Organization figures released Wednesday, hours after Duncan's death in Dallas. Nearly 4,000 deaths have been reported in the region. The situation is especially dire in Sierra Leone, which this month reported a one-day death toll of 121, according to Reuters , and Liberia, where more than 2,000 Ebola deaths have been recorded.
Here's how the epidemic and the response looks in those countries now.

The ongoing Ebola outbreak is the worst in history . Medical workers are overwhelmed by those seeking care, families struggle with dead and dying relatives, and children have been left orphaned and abandoned.
In Nigeria, the spread of Ebola appears to have been stopped ; there have been no new cases in Africa's largest country since the end of August.
But in Sierra Leone, the Guardian reports that the rapid escalation of cases has drawn comparisons to how the virus spread in Liberia, where Duncan was reportedly infected .
"The disease has reached every county of Liberia," Anthony Banbury, head of U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, told the BBC . "It is clear that the international community has to have a rapid and very strong response to get this disease under control before it wreaks much more massive havoc in these countries and possibly other ones."

A year later  Orissa braces for anothercyclonePrint
Express News Service | Bhubaneswar/muzaffarnagar | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:17 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 2:33 am
Bhubaneswar: Just about a year after cyclone Phailin ripped through south Orissa, the state is bracing for another cyclone hitting its coast. IMD said Monday that an upper air cyclonic circulation over the Gulf of Thailand has already led to the formation of a low pressure area over the Andaman Sea.
The low pressure would concentrate into a depression in next the 24 hours. IMD officials said that there is possibility that the depression would become a cyclonic storm. SC Sahu, director of IMD Bhubaneswar, said that whether it becomes a cyclonic storm would be known on October 10.
Muzaffarnagar tense after cattle slaughter rumours
Muzaffarnagar: Tension prevailed in Muzaffarnagar on Monday night as a tractor was burnt in Budhana area of the city after villagers alleged that it was carrying slaughtered cattle. The police later confirmed that the allegations of cattle slaughter were false.
A senior police officer said that the tractor was passing through Hariyakheda village when villagers allegedly saw an animal with ‘white skin’ and got agitated. “They believed that dead cattle were being transported after being sacrificed on Eid.
They were, in fact, animal skins and were being brought from a village in Baghpat,” said the officer. Senior superintendent of police H N Singh said, “We recieved information that the tractor was set aflame. We are looking into the allegations and extra security has been deployed.”

Delhi confidential: AirpriorityExpress News Service | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:09 am
Air priority
The broadcast of PM Narendra Modi’s maiden radio broadcast — Mann Ki Baat — was not limited to the 15-minute airtime it got on All India Radio at 11 am on October 3. In addition to offering the voice-over free of cost to private radio channels, private news channels and even community radios, many of whom aired it live, AIR and DD News repeated the broadcast in all regional languages the same evening. It seems like the public broadcasters wanted to leave no stone unturned to ensure that the PM’s radio debut was disseminated as widely as possible.
Not welcome
On a recent visit to New Delhi, Chhattisgarh’s former home minister Ramvichar Netam realised what it means to be out of power. Netam, who lost the Assembly elections last year, checked into Chhattisgarh Bhawan as a private guest, which meant he had to pay. But when he was handed the bill, he asked the staff to collect the payment from the Chhattisgarh government. “Or wait for five more years till I come back to power,” he is reported to have told the staff. Puzzled, the staff informed the state government. The Chhattisgarh Bhawan is understood to have received instructions from the state government not to take any bookings from Netam or his friends in the future.
Interpreter perks
Being the Prime Minister’s interpreter has its perks. Vinay Mohan Kwatra, who was joint secretary (counter-terrorism) in the Ministry of External Affairs, was hand-picked for Hindi-to-English interpretation for PM Narendra Modi. Kwatra has sat through all the PM’s meetings, including with SAARC heads of state. Last month, he travelled with Modi to the US and sat in his meeting with Obama. Kwatra is now set to be appointed for the sought-after position of joint secretary (Americas) as incumbent Vikram Doraiswami is headed for Uzbekistan as India’s envoy.

India finally has a talking PM:ShahPrint
Express News Service | Pune | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:06 am
BJP President Amit Shah continued his onslaught on the Congress and the NCP, claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has put India on the global map and restored national pride with his recent speeches in the US and his interactions with Japan and China.
“Finally, India has a talking Prime Minister,’’ he said at a poll rally in Hadapsar, where he was campaigning for BJP candidates of Hadapsar and Purandar Assembly seats. “Did anyone here know about the former Prime Minister’s visits to foreign countries?,’’ he asked. “Today, the world knows about the Prime Minister’s visit to Japan and Chinese president’s India visit. People heard the Prime Minister at Madison square,” he said. Shah also recalled the PM’s Independence day speech, saying that his Make in India campaign was well received and it was because of the people’s mandate that the country boasts such leadership.
Shah said Modi wanted Maharashtra to grow on all fronts and added that the state’s growth had suffered a setback in the Congress-NCP’s 15-year regime.

(The deal's value raised…)
NEW YORK: Facebook has closed its acquisition of mobile messaging service WhatsApp in a deal that is now worth $21.8 billion, up from the original $19 billion deal struck, thanks in part to the social network giant's rising stock price since February.
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook said Monday that it has named WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum to its board of directors. WhatsApp is by far Facebook's largest acquisition, and bigger than any that Google , Microsoft or Apple have ever done.
The deal's value raised eyebrows when it was announced on February 19, though analysts said it makes sense for Facebook to buy the popular messaging service.
WhatsApp has been growing rapidly, especially in Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia. It has more than 500 million users.

Kashmir flood victims face eviction

Srinagar
If Eid was just a happy memory for most people in Srinagar on Monday, the flood victims camping at a marriage hall in Sanat Nagar were deprived of that too as threat of eviction loomed over them. The marriage hall, which gave shelter to hundreds after the floods, has 26 families living in it. Their houses gone with the floods, they have nowhere to go. But at 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday, they must leave.
Syed Shamir, a volunteer managing the camp, said he would like the people to stay. “But this camp has to end at some point. The government has to step in and help these people,” he said. Mr. Shamir said the Deputy Commissioner of Srinagar, Farooq Shah, has asked them twice to shut down the camp. Mr. Farooq Shah, however, said: “We have identified places for 16 camp sites which will be monitored by the government. We will not let people be homeless. In one week, we will be doing the rehabilitation work.”
Mr. Shamir said he had visited the DC’s office and got many promises, but seen little work.

Stocks closed slightly lower Monday as the major indexes failed to build on Friday's rebound.
Tech stocks led the decline as the Nasdaq composite index dropped 20.82 points, or 0.5%, to 4454.80.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 17.78 points, or 0.1%, to 16,991.91 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.08 points, or 0.2%, to 1964.82.
On Friday -- at the end of a wild week marked by anxiety over Hong Kong protests, slowing global growth and Ebola -- the U.S. stock market staged a strong rally after a report showed a pickup in hiring last month, with the Dow pushing back above the 17,000 level.
But many investors remain uncertain about the outlook for stocks as the Fed nears the end of its stimulus program and considers raising rates.
"The tug of war between the bulls and the bears is ongoing now," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.
Some encouraging corporate news helped boost several stocks:
•Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) stock jumped 4.7% to $36.87 on news that HP will split into two : Hewlett Packard Enterpirse, led by HP CEO Meg Whitman, will sell computer servers, data-storage gear, software and other services to corporations. HP Inc. will consist of the PC and printer business and will be led by hardware chief Dion Weisler.

More apps target the busy apartment market0
Apartment List says it wants to save renters the aggravation and wasted time of tramping through prospective units that are just plain unsuitable. It has unveiled Look, which it says gives apartment hunters 360-degree, detailed views of rooms, floors, ceilings, exteriors and community amenities of units listed on its site. The effect is somewhat like looking at an interiors version of Google Street View. The company says it has photographed the interiors of more than 30,000 apartments (mostly large multiunit buildings, so far) in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Washington and Denver.
Doorsteps.com/swipe If you're not sure what you'd like in an apartment, the Doorsteps Swipe app would be happy to tell you. The company likens its service to the popular dating site Tinder, which matches couples based on their reactions to pictures of prospective dates.
If you're an apartment-hunter looking at properties through its app, you can give a thumbs up or thumbs down to the photographs you've seen. After a few of those, it claims, its algorithm gets a sense of what you find attractive, and will offer you feedback about what you like and dislike in terms of price and apartment amenities, to help you tailor your search.
Forrent.com Much of the rental industry seems to target its services to singles, couples and roommates, so people with kids may have to work harder to find an appropriate rental. ForRent.com has introduced a filter for schools based on verified attendance zones.
Renterresume.co One area of burgeoning interest in the multifamily apartment world is the development of tools to help landlords screen prospective tenants quickly.
RenterResume says its app has targeted its tenant-qualifying services toward small and midsize property managers. Based on criteria chosen by the landlord, the app will screen and provide approvals in real time, according to the company. There's no cost to the landlord. The would-be tenant pays a flat fee that can be applied to applications with landlords who use the service.
Zumper.com In the same vein, Zumper charges tenants a fee to use its Zumper Rental Application (aka Zapp), and in return will attach a credit report to rental applications they send to landlords.
Renters who use the app can send Zapp to any rental listings they find on zumper.com that display the Zapp logo. The company says it is aiming to create an industry standard for the apartment-rental application form. The Zapp feature began with San Francisco listings and plans to expand to Chicago, New York, Boston and Los Angeles.
And, Zumper reports that it surveyed monthly apartment costs for vacant units on its site (it claims to have a half-million listings) for August.
The survey found that among median rents for one-bedroom units, the six most-expensive locations were San Francisco ($3,100); New York ($2,995); Boston ($2,250); Washington ($2,100); Miami ($1,750) and Chicago ($1,737).

We know very little about Deen Dayal Upadhyaya today but that’s unlikely to stay that way.

Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. Photo credit WikimediaIn 1968, the year Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King were gunned down in full public view, it was hardly surprising that the murder of an Indian political leader in the dark of night should have escaped the world’s notice. But it shook the Sangh Parivar (then headed by “Guruji” Madhav Sadashiv Golwalker, with the Bharatiya Jan Sangh as its political wing. It also included the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parsihad or student wing, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, which worked among tribal communities, the Rashtriya Sewika Samiti or women’s wing and Vidya Bharati which ran the Saraswati Shishu Mandir schools) to its foundations and profoundly impacted Indian politics in subsequent decades.
Who was he? Students can get all the way through school and graduate college without once having heard of him and not drop a single mark. Yet today, he is the “guiding force” of the government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi rarely makes a speech without a reference to him or his vision, the Central Board of Secondary Education holds an all-India essay competition on him, big ticket Central government schemes are named after him and the PM’s signature Make In India program is dedicated to him (or rather, “laid at his feet”). His birth centenary (2015-16), the PM has decreed, will be marked by year-long celebrations.
Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, regarded by the political right as one of the 20th century’s most original thinkers, philosophers and economists, has thus far rated no more than a cursory mention in post-graduate lectures on political thought. But now, the long-dead stalwart of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, precursor of the BJP, has begun to enter the national consciousness and gradually permeate political discourse.
Subramanian Swamy, who wrote a paper on Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s philosophy of Integral Humanism way back in 1977, finds a receptive audience at Delhi’s highbrow, left-centrist dominated India International Centre when he speaks of Upadhyaya’s economic thought. Minister for Culture Shripad Yesso Naik creates consternation among his bureaucrats when he wants a blueprint for Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s centenary celebrations, because they’ve never heard of the Sangh icon. Similarly, the Publications Division is thrown into a flap when Information & Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar wants a book on Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, published during the previous NDA regime and subsequently forgotten. The minister now wants a compilation of Upadhyaya’s work published.
As for the Prime Minister, he rarely loses an opportunity to place “Deen Dayal-ji” front and center.
May 20, Central Hall of Parliament, after being elected PM: “Antyodaya, the service of the downtrodden, was Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s mission. That is why I say our government is for the poor and deprived. The coming year is important for us all. It will be his centenary year...we have to strive to fulfil his dreams. The party and government must decide how to celebrate the event.”
June 11, maiden speech in the Lok Sabha: “We are people who have grown up with the ideals of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya...who taught us the principle of Antyodaya. This government's priority is the benefit of the most underprivileged, going by the ideals of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Lohia and Gandhi.”
Sept 25, launch of Make in India: “In my personal life, in my political journey, today is very significant. It is the anniversary of Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, whose ideas inspired us to begin this political journey. (He) gave the philosophy of Integral Humanism to the world. On the anniversary of such a great man, who lived and strived for the country, I lay the Make in India program at his feet. We are determined to fulfil his dream.” (The speech was preceded by a flurry of tweets by the PM on Integral Humanism as the “guiding force”.)
A year ago, addressing BJP workers in Bhopal, he prophesized: “When the country celebrates Deen Dayal Upadhayaya's birth centenary in 2015-16, the BJP will rule most states.” In his meeting with BJP leaders on May 31, his first after the landslide Lok Sabha victory, a prominent item on the agenda was turning the centenary into a major event and promoting Integral Humanism.
Modi’s enchantment with Deen Dayal Upadhyaya is of long standing. He has unfailingly observed the late ideologue’s birth and death anniversaries and brings him up frequently in various contexts. Sample the speech kicking off his 2007 election campaign in Gujarat: “When Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya was alive, we celebrated even if our candidates could save their deposits in local elections. In those times, the municipality of Botad voted the Jan Sangh to power and Pt Deen Dayal came to felicitate the citizens. So it was you, the citizens of Botad, who laid the foundation of the BJP, who recognized our worth all those years ago.”
In a 2011 speech he said, “In the body of BJP as a party, in the ideology of BJP, rests the soul of Pt Deen Dayal-ji.” His blog offers a link to the site “Deendayal Sansar” – currently “under maintenance”.
Not to be outdone, BJP president Amit Shah, who was once treasurer of the Deen Dayal Research Institute (DRI) – a frontline Sangh organization dedicated to putting Integral Humanism into action – inaugurated his term on August 9 by saying: “In the year ahead, we will be celebrating the silver jubilee of Integral Humanism. Year 2015 marks the centenary year of our ideologue Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. This provides us with an opportunity to enlighten the masses....dedicate ourselves to Integral Humanism...propagate Deen Dayal-ji’s philosophy. I believe the ideals of Integral Humanism are not restricted by time. This is an invaluable treasure of ideas [and] can enable us to find solutions to [all] our contemporary problems. The government will function in the light of these principles.
The government has certainly lost no time in launching a raft of pro-poor programs named after the ideologue:
Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana – a livelihood and skill development program
Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana – a rural electrification scheme
Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana – a skill development scheme dovetailed with Make in India.
Sources in the Ministry of Human Resource Development have it that a commission may be set up to revisit NCERT school textbooks, hitherto dominated by Congress heroes, so that “nationalist” leaders like Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee can be included. Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, the Sangh Parivar’s ‘policy guy’, who heads an important Sangh affiliate – the Rambhau Mhalge Prabhodhini – says, “I believe some plans are already afoot in this direction. The level of literacy regarding Integral Humanism and Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya is low, because he was consistently disregarded by the powers that be.”
The HRD ministry has already set the ball rolling with an essay competition on the life and times of “renowned thinker Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya” by the CBSE. Gujarat, naturally, went the extra mile. In Ahmedabad, 450 schools celebrated his anniversary last fortnight.
Even as the I&B ministry scrambles for material on Upadhyaya with the objective of bringing out a series on him, the RSS publication wing, Suruchi Prakashan, is preparing a blitz of books by, among others, the former HRD Minister Murli Manohar Joshi and RSS veteran Bajranglal Gupta.
Are these early signs of the iconization of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, to proceed apace with the de-iconization of Jawaharlal Nehru? A Surya Prakash, veteran journalist and leading light of right-wing think tanks, likens the hold of Nehruvian thought on the intellectual ecosystem of the country to the proliferation of Congress grass (parthenium), which strangles all other plants. De-weeding, he says, is imminent.
ABVP activist Rashmi Das probably speaks for lakhs of swayamsevaks when she says it’s high time the political right developed its own iconography, to challenge the domination of the left. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya has been added to the pantheon of Mahatma Gandhi and Ram Manohar Lohia (both already appropriated by Modi). Certainly, Upadhyaya appears to represent a counter-to-Nehruvian thought and its hallmarks, like state control over the economy, an idealistic foreign policy as represented by Panchsheel and pro-minorityism.
Which brings us to the question: who was Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and what is Integral Humanism all about? For a man who has schools, colleges, roads, hospitals and a slew of government schemes named after him at both central and state levels, very little is known about him outside Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) circles. “Google Guru” offers limited assistance. Gathering information involves a trek to Delhi’s crowded Jhandewalan, a locality distinguished only by the fact that it houses the unpretentious RSS HQ, Keshav Kunj. In the neighbourhood stands a far more impressive multi-storeyed structure, the Deen Dayal Research Institute – repository of all things Deen Dayal.
From the many dusty volumes, pamphlets and CDs emerges a saintly, almost Gandhi-like figure, with a predilection for austerity made palatable by a sense of humour and a willingness to get his hands dirty. By all accounts, the orphaned son of a humble railway employee, born in 1916 in a village near Mathura, showed early signs of intellectual precocity. He won awards and scholarships from the Maharaja of Sikar and later, industrialist Ghanshyam Das Birla. Turning down all offers of government and private sector employment, he joined the RSS. He kept company with Nana Deshmukh and Sundar Singh Bhandari, RSS pracharaks who went on to play a critical role in anti-Congress politics in the 1960s and 70s.
Rising rapidly through the RSS ranks, he started a series of publications including its current mouthpiece, Panchjanya. When this was banned, he started another. That, too, was suppressed. Undeterred, he launched a third. He served as compositor, machine man and despatcher and never missed an issue.
In 1951, he joined the RSS’s political wing, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, under Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and soon became its general secretary. Mukherjee famously said, “If I could get two more Deen Dayals, I would change the political map of India.” Mukherjee was murdered shortly thereafter – a fate his protégé would meet some 15 years later. In the meantime, he was the party’s “mind, heart and soul”, taking it from four seats in 1957 to 35 in 1967.
Anecdotes on Deen Dayal abound, creating a mythology to which every Sangh worker subscribes. In a recent lecture, KN Govindacharya, who parted ways with the BJP under controversial circumstances, recalls how Upadhyaya expelled seven of the nine Jan Sangh MLAs in Rajasthan for opposing the Zamindari Abolition Act, political considerations be damned. He was capable of bold, principled decisions.
At the same time, he was self-effacing, reluctant to hold office and ran the party by dint of moral authority over his workers. For all his dedication and commitment, he had a light touch and could laugh when shouldered aside by the self-important or rowdy. He washed his own clothes, wore his banians until they were tattered, had his hair cut by street barbers and could whip up a mean khichdi for a sick associate.
While Deen Dayal was credited with a genius for organization, he proved to be the Sangh’s foremost thinker. He outlined his philosophy for governance to some 500 party workers in 1964 and presented an expanded version at its plenary session in 1965. The final version was delivered in the form of four lectures in Bombay, titled “Integral Humanism”. According to BJP veteran LK Advani, the title was chosen to contrast it with the thesis of ‘Radical Humanism’ put forward by MN Roy, the former Communist leader.
Integral Humanism was adopted by the BJS as its official doctrine and subsequently passed on to the BJP. The Sangh saw it as a home-grown, entirely indigenous economic and political philosophy that reconciled socialism and capitalism.
Subramanian Swamy, in his book Hindus Under Siege, explains: “IHT [Integral Humanism Theory] recognized that in a democratic market economy an individual has technical freedom of choice but the system without safeguards fails to accommodate the varying capabilities and endowments of a human being. Since the concept of survival of the fittest prevails in such a system, therefore some individuals achieve great personal advancement while others get trampled on or disabled in the ensuing rat race. We need to build a safety net into our policy for the underprivileged or disabled while simultaneously rewarding the meritorious or gifted. Otherwise, the politically empowered poor in a democracy who are in a majority will clash with the economically empowered rich who are the minority, thereby causing instability and upheaval in a market system.”
In a subsequent book, India and China, A Comparative Perspective, Swamy says IHT was the only alternative to Marxism and capitalism presented after 1947, but did not gain currency for political reasons. While capitalism suffers from the “one dimensional concept of the human pursuit of material progress”, IHT envisages a system that permits competitiveness while seeking adjusting complementaries, harmonizing material progress with spiritual advancement.
Advani devoted a chapter in his book My Country, My Life to his “political guru”, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya in which he says, “Deen Dayal-ji felt that both Capitalism and Communism were flawed philosophies...one considers man a mere selfish being hankering after money, having only one law, the law of fierce competition...whereas the other views him as a feeble lifeless cog in the whole scheme of things. The centralization of power, economic and political, is implied in both. They pit one section of society against the other, the individual against the collective, man against nature.”
Integral Humanism, he adds, did not receive the attention that western political theories did. But it is “worthy of being placed alongside the works of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, with both of whom Deendayal-ji had so much in common.”
In the 1950s and 60s, Upadhyaya was lambasted for being right-wing and pro-capitalist, but insisted the BJS stood for a socialist economy, with a 1:20 ratio between the lowest and highest incomes and nationalization of infrastructure industries. Nehru, he said, was a socialist when it came to levying taxes but a capitalist when it came to amassing profits.
He certainly favoured economic freedom and opportunities for entrepreneurship, and criticized the government of the day for stifling avenues of investment. He had a horror of statist monopolies. On the other hand, he emphasized decentralization of the economy, so as to empower local communities to make economic and developmental choices. He did not favour big business; he preferred the Gandhian ideal of large production from small units, “manufacture by the masses for the masses”.
He spoke of a “national sector”, a sort of public-private partnership that would facilitate self-employment and individual entrepreneurship. In brief, says Mahesh Chandra Sharma, who heads the Research and Development Foundation for Integral Humanism, Upadhyaya wanted economic freedom, along with the Right to Work. He wanted private ownership of the means of production but not centralization of ownership.
In agriculture, he favoured land ownership and strongly opposed Soviet-style cooperatives, then a hot topic of discussion. Dr Mahesh Chandra Sharma’s book Economic Philosophy of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya quotes him as saying, “We should finish the unaccomplished task of land reforms and agricultural marketing.” Upadhyaya wanted self-reliance in foodgrains but warned against building up excessive buffer stocks that would distort the market – a tune many economists are singing in the wake of heavy procurement by the Food Corporation of India. Nor did he believe that government administered prices could combat inflation.
He was no admirer of the planning process and strongly critiqued all the Five-Year Plans for failing to focus on employment, infrastructure, agricultural production, education and public health. Upadhyaya spoke of appropriate technology as opposed to arbitrary mechanization, advocated sustainable consumption and set out principles of corporate ethics and social responsibility.
Two of Upadhyaya’s acolytes sought to put his theories into practice. Dattopant Thengadi founded the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, which went on to become the biggest trade union in the country. He also launched the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and famously turned down a Padma Bhushan from the Vajpayee government because he disapproved of its policies. Nanaji Deshmukh set up the Deen Dayal Research Institute, which created a model of rural development based on self-reliance. The fact that it boosted economic prosperity in the several hundred villages in Chitrakoot where it was applied attracts a great deal of attention from development agencies worldwide and drew fulsome praise from former President APJ Abdul Kalam.
How much of Upadhyaya and Integral Humanism has Modi put into practice? If Nehru was the Fabian socialist and Manmohan Singh the Keynesian, is Modi the Integral Humanist? Analyst Alam Srinivas says: “Modi has absorbed and assimilated the RSS economic thought, including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and interpreted it to suit the current context. He has modernized and contemporized old ideas to give them a new look, which appeals to all generations.”
He finds Modi’s approach practical and commonsensical, based on the freedom of stakeholders to take their own decisions and choose their own modes of development. The role of government is that of facilitator. Upadhyaya would doubtless also have approved the egalitarian approach to development and welfare; in Modi’s Gujarat, government schemes and projects are not intended to benefit one section or the other.
Swadeshi (Made in India) translates into Make in India: invite foreign capital to boost Indian manufacturing, domestic consumption and exports, in pretty much the same way as China. Decentralization, Modi-style, involves setting up hubs where small- and medium-scale enterprises proliferate around one big central industry – as he has done in Gujarat. It also means democratization of opportunity, offering the same incentives to every entrepreneur. His “7M” formula – Man, Material, Machine, Motive, Management, Money and Market – is borrowed from Upadhyaya.
In agriculture, he treads the parallel tracks of land ownership – as a means of production – and farmers’ cooperatives – as a means of agricultural marketing. He breaks problems down to find practical solutions. If the fundamental problem of the agricultural sector is boosting farm incomes, that is what he seeks to redress. Like Upadhyaya, he had no use for the Planning Commission and its top-down approach. He also subscribes to the public-private partnership (PPP) model, redefined as P4 or people-public-private partnership – a bottoms-up approach Upadhyaya would have appreciated.
Sahasrabuddhe sees the impact of Upadhyaya in the Clean Ganga, Swachch Bharat and skill development programs as well, all of which gel with the holistic approach to human development. Even the government’s foreign policy, he says, carries the stamp of Integral Humanism. Given that it is the BJP’s ideological cornerstone, naturally it has an important place in the PM’s scheme of things.
What about Upadhyaya’s political thought? Integral Humanism believes Dhamma is the guiding principle of the state. Dhamma is distinct from religion; it is the moral compass of government. He rejects statism and espouses liberal notions of individual liberty, within the parameters of social responsibility. His state was secular and unitary, albeit one in which power was decentralized. Upadhyaya accepted that western concepts of ‘nationalism, democracy, socialism, world peace and world unity’ were good ideals even though they did not appear to have worked well in practice.
Modi, then, has brought Deen Dayal Upadhyaya to life. But is he reconciled to his icon’s death? Will his government pick up the threads of a 56-year-old murder investigation that came to nothing?
On February 11, 1968, Upadhyaya boarded the first-class coupe of the Sealdah-Pathankot Express from Lucknow, bound for Patna. His body was found lying parallel to the railway tracks outside Mughalserai station in the early hours of the morning. A commission was appointed to probe the murder and concluded that he had been pushed out of the compartment by unidentified thieves, struck his head against a traction pole and died. It was murder, but was it assassination?
Recently, Madhya Pradesh BJP general secretary Arvind Menon kicked up a political storm by alleging that the Congress was indirectly responsible for Upadhyaya’s death. Congress leader Ajay Singh responded by challenging Menon to name the murderer. Singh pointed out that BJS leader Balraj Madhok, in his autobiography Zindagi Ka Safar had alleged that Atal Bihari Vajpayee exhorted him to float the accident theory about Upadhyaya's death and he was shunted out when he refused to do so. It was common knowledge, said Singh, that Vajpayee became the Bharatiya Jana Sangh president after Upadhyaya’s death.
Advani writes: “Till date, his murder has remained an unsolved mystery, although outwardly it appeared to have been a case of ordinary crime. The government accepted the demand of a group of MPs belonging to different political parties for a judicial enquiry, which was headed by Justice YV Chandrachud. The report he submitted, in which he said that he found no political angle to the murder and that it was a case of ordinary crime, satisfied no one.”
Nanaji Deshmukh punched holes in the Chandrachud commission’s findings. “Even the Sessions Judge of Varanasi disbelieved the CBI story that two petty thieves had murdered Punditji,” he wrote. The commission’s report did not explain why Upadhyaya was standing near the door of the bogie, or why he was clutching a Rs 5 note in his hand. Nor did it deal with the presence of a stranger in the bogie, which railway staff had testified to. The theft motive, too, was dubious because his suitcase and watch – the only items of value he was carrying – were untouched.
The timing of the death, too, remains a mystery, with the state CID and CBI giving separate versions. The commission itself acknowledges that the symmetrical, neat manner in which the body was found did not argue death from a single impact with the traction pole. Govindacharya points out that the extent of injuries – his head had sustained a huge gash and his arms and legs were broken – also did not gel with the accident theory. Private investigations conducted at the time, he says, traced the killer to Nepal and identified him as a “Pathan”.
Had Upadhyaya survived, there’s little doubt he would have impacted the politics of India. He, rather than Vajpayee and Advani, would have steered the fortunes of the political right. Deshmukh played a critical role in the struggle against Emergency but retired from politics and left the field to the younger duo. Thengadi, who evinced no interest in politics, nonetheless made it clear that the NDA regime had strayed from the party’s principles. His BMS staged a rally against its economic policies and the SJM’s mouthpiece described them as “anti-national”. For all its lip service to Upadhyaya, the Vajpayee government made no attempt to propagate or apply his teachings. He remained unknown to the nation at large.
An omission that the Modi government appears set to rectify. It’s early days yet, but Sahasrabuddhe says the government is doing its homework and will roll out plans for a grand centenary next year. There’s “no doubting its passion and commitment”. The Deen Dayal Research Institute is already a hub of frenetic activity as it deals with a flood of queries from government departments trying to familiarize themselves with Upadhyaya and his works, in between preparations to welcome Narendra Modi on October 11. He will address invitees on the life and times of Nanaji Deshmukh, the man who attempted to actualize Integral Humanism in a cluster of villages. Deen Dayal’s votaries would love to see Modi do so across the nation.

Waldorf Astoria New York to be sold for nearly $2 billionThe hotel -- which occupies an entire city block in Manhattan -- will be sold to Anbang Insurance Group Co. Ltd., which is granting Hilton a management agreement to continue to operate the property for the next 100 years.
Hilton said the Art Deco-style property will undergo a "major renovation."
The Waldorf Astoria New York is the flagship hotel of Hilton Worldwide’s luxury brand, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts. Since 2007, Hilton has expanded the brand to 27 locations, including Chicago.
Hilton, which also owns the Conrad brand, and its rivals Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc and Marriott International Inc are enjoying strong business due to an increase in business and leisure travel.
The Waldorf Astoria New York hotel was bought by founder Conrad Hilton in 1949, eighteen years after it opened in Park Avenue.
It was the setting for the “Weekend at The Waldorf,” the first movie shot entirely outside Hollywood's studios, and its $1,000-per-week Suite 2728 was home to Marilyn Monroe when she fled her troubled life in Hollywood.
The hotel's Towers presidential suite, which ranges from 1,600 to 2,000 square feet, now costs about $1,609 per night for a single person, according to its website.
Hilton said on Monday it intends to use the proceeds from the sale to acquire more hotel assets in the United States.
Earlier last year, a group including Zhang Xin, co-founder of Shanghai's Soho China, took a 40 percent stake in midtown Manhattan's General Motors Building, one of New York's most-valuable office towers, said Doug Murphy, director of analytics at Real Capital Analytics Inc., a research firm that tracks commercial real estate sales. That $1.4 billion deal was the largest Chinese purchase of a U.S. building before the pending Waldorf sale, he said.
Including Anbang's purchase of the Waldorf from Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Chinese investors will have bought $2.7 billion of New York-area real estate in 2014, topping last year's $2.6 billion, according to Real Capital.
In the past few years, the Chinese government has allowed the country's insurance companies to allocate a portion of their funds into global real estate, Mallory said. With concerns about volatility in the property market at home, New York and and other major markets around the world, including London and Paris, “tend to be safe havens for any global investor,” he said.

Reflection on Mindfulness in Businessreddit
One of the gifts of being a student is getting a second chance each year to focus on resolutions. If something didn't stick after New Year's, the first day of school brings with it the perfect time to try again.
As a second-year MBA candidate at NYU Stern, I still make those aspirational first-day-of-school resolutions. This year, one such commitment was to set aside time each week for reflection. In business school, I've received incredible opportunities to develop knowledge, advance my career and interact with extraordinary individuals. Because this two-year experience is nothing if not intense, however, I often sacrifice moments for self-reflection because I focus my energy on short-term to-do lists.
Enter my resolution to spend some time taking in the bigger picture.
To my great fortune, I have a partner this year in my effort to pause and reflect. The Stern School of Business has joined with Global Spiritual Life at NYU, with support from the Lenz Foundation, to introduce the NYU Mindfulness in Business Initiative . The first event of the year featured Dan Harris, best-selling author and co-anchor for ABC's Nightline. Being in business school, I expected Harris's recommendations for mindful living to consist of checklists and frameworks. Instead, he shared with us his path to meditation, and the clarity he's found as a result. He made no promises, but offered a convincing case about the value in stepping back and gaining the presence of mind to become aware of thoughts and impulses before acting on them.
Prior to the event, I held some unfair judgments about the practice of meditation. It couldn't be for me. I don't have incense at home, I admit to worldly ambition and have never seriously considered giving up red meat. Harris introduced me to a very different personification of meditation: a practice to increase self-awareness, humor and compassion, to reduce stress and to allow for measured decision-making.
Given the desirability of those characteristics, I began minimizing the stigma I associated with meditation in favor of more open consideration as to how to achieve a mindful state. For students frequently pressured by peer comparison, demanding schedules and the always popular "what do you want to do with your life?" inquiry, I see the Mindfulness in Business Initiative playing a natural role in the future of business education. Among the tools we should have at our disposal upon graduation is the ability to respond to stimuli with thoughtfulness instead of blind reactivity. This capability can only gain value as life and work continue to increase in complexity.
I meditated for the first time this morning. Truthfully, I feel like an impostor calling what I did meditation. I failed over and over again, catching myself thinking about reading assignments I've already missed, the temperature in my apartment, that song in my head that's stuck on repeat, and a host of other questions, reminders and random thoughts. I walked out the door, however, not thinking about the failure. I thought about trying it again tomorrow. I thought about taking little steps to quiet my mind, better myself, and make that latest resolution stick.

6 Habits to Work From Home Successfullyreddit
The digital era allows many of us to work from home, but it's important to implement these six habits if you want to stay productive.
Odds are, you've worked from home at least once in your professional career. It's growing to be a more popular option, especially with the onset of newer technologies that allow us to connect remotely with greater ease and more personal interaction. Working from home is sometimes seen as an option less productive than working from an office, but under the right conditions, it can actually be more productive.
Make sure you're using these strategies to work from home successfully:
1. Turn off the distractions. It's tempting to play music or have a television on as background noise, and for some people, it can help set a relaxing environment, but the minute you find yourself distracted by it -- turn it off.
2. Establish a work environment. If you can, dedicate a specific room of your house to become a "work zone." Try to use this space only for working and avoid working elsewhere in your house. This will help it feel like a miniature office, and will motivate you to focus on work when you're there.
3. Resist the temptation to constantly connect. Working from home is a good chance to focus on tasks instead of back-and-forth communication. Don't be afraid to disconnect from your chat program and put your nose to the grindstone.
4. Have regular touch points. Set specific times to catch up on communication, whether that means holding a mini meeting, logging into a chat program or simply checking your email.
5. Keep your normal schedule. Try to start and stop working around the same time you usually do. This will help you get in a "work day" mentality.
6. Draw a line. Working from home too often can put you in a constant state of feeling "on duty." Make sure, at the end of the day, you disconnect from "work mode" however you can. Close the door of your office. Shut down your email. Turn off your phone if you have to.
It's good to utilize a blend of working from home and working in your office; that way, you get the best of both worlds. Eventually, you'll master the art of working from home, and your cumulative productivity will skyrocket.

Demand for grants: Centre likely to seek minimalfundsPrint
Written by Surabhi | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:47 am
To keep its spending under check, the government is expected to seek a minimal amount in its first supplementary demand for grants that will be tabled in the Winter Session of Parliament, expected to begin next month.
The government is likely to limit its requirements at about Rs 8,000 crore in the demand for grants although the finance ministry has just asked government departments and ministries to submit their estimates for additional funds.
“The calculations are just being started but it is expected to be about Rs 8,000 crore or so as major spending requirements will be taken up in the March session. Most fund requirements will be met with internal savings as of now,” said a senior government official.
Among the major items that may need cash as of now is the CST compensation to states governments for which the Centre is planning to release the first installment later this year. States have said that Rs 13,000 crore is due in arrears and the Centre is keen to start payments in order to move ahead with the roll out of the goods and services tax.
The official said that big spending items like fuel subsidy is expected also to be taken up towards the end of the fiscal.

Raj targets Modi: has hiddenagendaWarning against any such move, he said, “Nobody should dare to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra, or else 10 crore Marathi people — of the total 11.40 crore population in the state — will not hesitate to take to the streets.”
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:47 am
In his first such attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Monday accused him of a “hidden agenda” to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra, adding that he would “join hands with” the Shiv Sena “if such a situation arises”.
Speaking to The Indian Express, he said, “Can you imagine a Prime Minister holding 23 rallies for the Maharashtra assembly polls? Why is he so focussed on Maharashtra? …There is a larger design behind this campaign. It is not confined to just displaying the political might of BJP or Modi. It is aimed at wielding control of the financial capital of India.”
Warning against any such move, he said, “Nobody should dare to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra, or else 10 crore Marathi people — of the total 11.40 crore population in the state — will not hesitate to take to the streets.”
He said, “If such a situation arises, I will join hands with the Shiv Sena and all those who are committed to the cause of the Marathi Manoos in Maharashtra to save Mumbai.”
Asked why he did not reconcile his differences with the Shiv Sena after it split from the BJP, Thackeray said, “I am firm on ekla chalo re… as my politics is not for money or power alone.”
However, he added, “After the split, Sena president Uddhav Thackeray called me and asked me about my health. I said yes, I have fever… The question is if the Sena-BJP alliance was intact, would the MNS matter… But when it comes to fighting for Mumbai, I am ready to shake hands with all for the greater cause of the Marathi Manoos.”
Alleging that Modi cannot look beyond Gujarat, he said, “It is a systematic move to undermine socially and economically empowered Maharashtra. How else does one explain their move to shift the Reserve Bank of India (divisions) from Mumbai to Delhi? Or a bullet train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad? …If the issue was related to administrative inconvenience, it should have come up when the RBI operations started. Now, in this age of technology, physical distances hardly matter.”
While emphasising that he has “nothing against Modi”, Thackeray also criticised him for interfering in the state’s affairs. “If we look at the developments and the BJP campaign closely, we can get a glimpse of their hidden agenda. It will surface gradually. And that is what has got me worried,” he said.
Alleging that Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel also comes to Mumbai and asks industries continued…

FDI in LLPs to be freed from seeking governmentnodPrint
Written by Amitav Ranjan | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:46 am
Foreign direct investments in limited liability partnerships would soon be freed from seeking government nod. All that an LLP would need to do is submit an undertaking from its partners and a certificate from a chartered accountant on the extent of foreign control in it.
Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion — after consulting Reserve Bank of India and Department of Economic Affairs — has concluded that in sectors or activities where 100 per cent FDI is allowed under the automatic route, the foreign investor would not require government approval.
“This would free the FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion Board) from the burden of dealing with all cases of foreign investment in LLP without any substantive issue,” the RBI said while giving ‘no objection’ for automatic route sectors.
In sectors where FDI is restricted to below 100 per cent but under the automatic route, the RBI wants the LLP to furnish the undertaking and the CA’s certificate before being allowed to take the FDI through automatic route.
That is because of the basic difficulty inherent in the nature of governance of an LLP where the degree of control does not depend on the capital of profit share of the investors but on the “qualitative provisions of the partnership agreement”.
“Thus, both for FIPB as well as for RBI, it will be difficult to assess whether the degree of foreign control agrees with that defined for companies (24, 49 or 74 per cent) which reflects the comfort of regulators on how much foreign control can be ceded in a given sector considered strategically important,” RBI said.
After certification, the proposed norms would provide the LLPs, existing or new, the same FDI status as available to Indian companies through automatic route in sectors with cap on investments. The new rules, mooted last April, were sent to Ministry of Corporate Affairs on September 25 for concurrence.
They would be an improvement over existing rules whereby LLPs have a restricted regime as any FDI or any form of foreign investment in LLP, direct or indirect, needs prior FIPB. FDI in LLP is not permitted in sectors with caps.
Restrictions would continue in sectors that are eligible to accept 100 percent FDI under automatic route but are subject to FDI-linked performance related conditions; sectors eligible to accept FDI under government approval route; agricultural/plantation activity and print media; and, prohibited sectors not eligible to accept FDI.
LLPs have become the globally-preferred vehicle of business to overcome tax issues and red tape that otherwise dog foreign investors. Owing to flexibility in its structure and operation, it would be useful for small and medium enterprises, in general, and for the enterprises in services sector, in particular.

CBEC to port regulators: Need faster customsclearancesPrint
Written by Shruti Srivastava | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:45 am
Amid increasing pressure from developed nations to ratify the WTO trade facilitation agreement, the central board of excise and customs (CBEC) has asked regulatory agencies handling clearances to upgrade their facilities and increase their manpower at various ports to facilitate round-the-clock clearances.
India is yet to ratify the agreement, a key area of interest for developed nations that would reduce transaction cost and smoothen the movement of cargo across the globe.
All WTO members are simplifying or have already simplified their customs procedures in view of the impending agreement.
In a meeting chaired by revenue secretary Shaktikanta Das last month, agencies including food safety and standards authority of India (FSSAI), plant protection, quarantine and storage department, animal quarantine department and drug controller of India among others, were asked to “benchmark their infrastructure and manpower required for 24X7 operations at ports in order to bring down the dwell time”.
“The customs department clears only after receiving clearance certificates from other regulatory agencies. However, despite the 24×7 port operations announced two years back, other agencies have been found lacking. This leads to congestion at the sea and air ports. The board has asked them to assess their dwell time, the volume handled and manpower required to speed up the customs clearance,” a government source told The Indian Express.
The source said that in a lot of cases, clearances for products are pending since April 2014. For instance, some cases regarding chocolates and olive oil are pending with the FSSAI since April-May this year. “The total clearance time has been on a rise for some of these agencies,” the source added.
The UPA-II had announced round-the-clock customs clearance in August 2012 to remove constraints for international trade. Earlier the import and export cargo, delivered at a time when clearance facilities were unavailable, had to wait till the facilities opened to move on to their destination.
To remove the piling up of cargo, the measure was announced on a pilot basis at Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai airports and Chennai, Kolkata, Kandla and JNPT, Mumbai, sea ports.
At that time, other government agencies such as concerned port authority, drug controller, FSSAI and private players like custodians, customs house agents, banks etc were asked to synchronise with the extended work hours.
Further, for bringing down the compliance cost and time, the department is also considering doing away with physical submission of some documents like bill of entry and shipping bill. This will be done by using digital signatures based on electronic data interchange (EDI), the source said.

Gold sinks to 15-month low on dollarrallyPrint
ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:42 am
Global gold price continued its downward slide and hit a 15-month low of $1,183.46 per ounce on Monday before recovering as the US dollar continued to remain strong, dampening investors’ appetite for the yellow metal.
Dollar has an inverse relationship with gold and as the US currency appreciates, investors move their investments from gold to dollar, thereby weakening the precious metal.
Bullion has dropped by over 14 per cent in the last six months from over $1,380 per ounce in March. While it hit a 15-month low on Monday it later recovered to trade at over $1,190. Even in India the price of gold (standard) in Mumbai has fallen by around 12 per cent from over Rs 30,000 per ten grams to Rs 26,560 per ten grams now.
Experts feel that the precious metal is on a downward trajectory and the trend in India will be in line with the global movement.
“Since there is a correlation between gold and dollar, currently gold is being weighed down by the dollar strength and higher interest rate scenario. It is on a downward trajectory for now and even in India the trend is likely to remain in line with the global decline as rupee has not depreciated much against the dollar,” said Rajini Panicker, head of commodities at Phillip Capital.
There are expectations that US Federal Reserve may go in for interest rate hike in June 2015 and while dollar will rise on that account, it will further dampen investor sentiment on gold and other commodities.
Had the rupee depreciated against the dollar, the fall in gold prices in India would have been more pronounced, however, it has largely remained stable over the last three months even as other emerging market currencies fell by over 15 per cent against the dollar. A stable rupee means that the percentage decline in gold prices in rupee terms will be in line with the fall in dollar terms.

Big Billion Day sale: Flipkart faces social media backlash over crashes  misleading pricingThe Big Billion Day sale seems to have earned Flipkart more angry customers than satisfied ones.
ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:41 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 7:06 am
Billed as India’s largest discount sale ever, e-commerce company Flipkart’s ‘Big Billion Day’ sale on Monday brought with it some unwanted backlash on the social media, with disgruntled shoppers taking to Facebook and Twitter to vent their ire over server “crashes” and “misleading” pricing claims.
The website’s servers seemed clearly overloaded within a couple of hours of the sale opening early in the morning. Many users complained of landing on error pages or seeing their transactions being interrupted midway through. Additionally, consumers claimed that offers advertised by Flipkart in the newspapers were not available on the website.
“The traffic was heavy but server did not crash,” a Flipkart spokesperson said, but refused to give any details. A statement by Flipkart founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said: “Our technology team has been dedicated towards addressing errors and providing constant support to accommodate the largest scale of traffic and customer visits e-commerce has witnessed across the country.” CEO Sachin Bansal claimed his company hit its target of $100 million in gross merchandise value (value of goods sold) in 10 hours.
The day also saw significant offline and online activity by Flipkart’s rivals Snapdeal and Amazon India, with Snapdeal running a campaign with the tagline: “For others it’s a big day. For us, today is no different.” Amazon has been running a sale from October 4-6, calling it the ‘Mission to Mars’ weekend.
“Snapdeal had a record breaking day of sales on October 6. We witnessed sales of over a crore rupees a minute, with lakhs of products being sold in a single day,” its co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl said in a statement.
Flipkart had run massive marketing campaigns, with advertisements splashed across newspapers and outdoor media announcing its discount sale on Monday. Within hours, though, exasperated users took to Twitter, Facebook and blogging to attack the company’s pricing claiming that in some instances, the “discounted offerings” were actually priced higher than on rival e-tailing sites while in other cases, the mark-up prices were seen to have been first hiked, and then ‘discounted’ to a prices close to market rates.

Wall St dips in choppy trading; GT Advanced Technologies tanksWall Street falls in choppy day; traders wary before earnings
By Reuters | 7 Oct, 2014, 03.01AM IST
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.72 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 16,991.97, the S&P 500 lost 3.06 points.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: US stocks fell in choppy trading on Monday, with traders nervously eyeing the start of earnings season, while the S&P 500 failed to remain above a key technical level.
With top economic indicators, including payrolls, out of the way, equities had little in the way of catalysts. The recent strength in the US dollar and continued weakness in the European economy cast a shadow over the earnings season that is about to begin.
"Markets are reflecting nervousness around third-quarter earnings given the strong dollar and a very weak macro environment in Europe," said Jim Russell, senior equity strategist for US Bank Wealth Management, which manages $120 billion in assets out of in Cincinnati.
"It is very possible that estimate cuts are in front of us," he said.
Micron shares fell 4 per cent to $32.57 after Samsung unveiled plans to spend $14.7 billion on a new semiconductor facility.
Hewlett-Packard posted the S&P 500's largest gains, up 4.7 per cent to $36.87 after it said it would split into two listed companies and eliminate another 5,000 jobs.
GT Advanced Technologies , Apple's partner in a sapphire glass plant in Arizona, said it had filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection and its shares tumbled 92.8 per cent to 80 cents.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.78 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 16,991.91, the S&P 500 lost 3.08 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 1,964.82 and the Nasdaq Composite
dropped 20.82 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 4,454.80.
The S&P 500 was unable to hold above 1,975, "which is proving to be a real resistance point," said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.
The benchmark's 50-day moving average stands just below 1,975 and it has closed below that average for five straight sessions.
About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, below the 7.2 billion average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.
The largest per centage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was CareFusion, up 22.9 per cent after medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson agreed to buy it for $12.2 billion in cash and stock.
On the Nasdaq, a top mover was also related to an acquisition, with Durata Therapeutics up 74.6 per cent to $24.24. Actavis said it would buy Durata for about $675 million.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Petrobras , up 14.24 per cent to $15.96 and Bank of America, up 0.06 per cent to $17.30.
On the Nasdaq, Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, down 76.4 per cent to $1.57, joined GT Advanced Tech and Micron among the most heavily traded.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,676 to 1,383, for a 1.21-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,612 issues fell and 1,044 advanced for a 1.54-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

corruption & bribery
Fasts, protests and special prayers for the early release of AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa continued across Tamil Nadu on Monday even as the stage has been set for the hearing of her bail plea in the assets case in the Karnataka High Court on Tuesday.
Anticipating a large number of AIADMK cadre flocking to the garden city, the Bangalore Police imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 in a one km radius around the Karnataka High Court and around the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison, where Ms. Jayalalithaa and the other three convicted in the wealth case are lodged.
Bangalore Police Commissioner M.N. Reddi said security had been tightened and over 2,000 personnel led by a Joint Commissioner would be deployed at both places.
In Tamil Nadu thousands of AIADMK cadres and sympathisers held rallies, human chain formations and prayers for Ms. Jayalalithaa’s release. Party cadres organised a special ‘yagam’ at the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai.
Schools to work
Meanwhile, a day after the Federation of Association of Private Schools in Tamil Nadu announced that member-schools would remain closed on October 7 to express solidarity with Ms. Jayalalithaa, came a U-turn on Monday evening with the declaration that schools would function on Tuesday.
Another potentially huge embarrassment was averted with the prosecution team in the appeal by Ms. Jayalalithaa and others making it clear that it was functioning under a GO — appointing Bhavani Singh as Special Public Prosecutor in the case — issued by Karnataka in 2013 and not the one issued by the prosecuting agency in Tamil Nadu, the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption.

First ride: 2015 Ford F-150 tops out at $61 0001
The powerful engine also has less mass to move around. Ford is betting big on aluminum for this new generation of trucks, becoming the first automaker to introduce on a large scale a vehicle with a completely aluminum body.
The switch from steel means the top-end Platinum model sheds 762 pounds compared with the outgoing generation. By keeping the engine’s power the same, this pickup has noticeably more pickup.
Lean on the throttle and this EcoBoost rewards you with smooth, robust acceleration and a hearty engine note (that’s artificially piped through the truck’s speakers). The power and response make it clear a V-8 is becoming irrelevant.
The transmission feels quicker and more eager than most of Ford’s rivals. The ride quality is as supple as any full-size truck, despite riding on 20-inch rims. And the cabin keeps outside noise outside.
This EcoBoost model is also the new top-dog in towing for the light-duty truck segment Ford says, capable of lugging 12,200 pounds behind it.
During our testing, the new F-150 hauled a 10,000-pound trailer. It never blinked. There’s no escaping the weight of a loaded three-horse trailer behind you, but the engine and transmission felt like they could keep going all day.
The $61,000 sticker price is a lot of money for any vehicle, and a cool $20,000 higher than what the average full-size truck buyer paid in 2013, according to Edmunds.com. It’s also quite a jump from the outgoing generation of high-end F-150s -- previously the truck maxxed out at around $56,000 if you tried hard to add every option.
But for Texas-sized luxury and capability, Ford’s F-150 Platinum lives up to its name.

The 24-year-old succumbed to bullet injuries sustained in police firing during a clash in Ahmedabad’s Shahpur area on Sunday night.
A 24-year-old youth on Monday succumbed to bullet injuries sustained in police firing during a clash in Ahmedabad’s Shahpur area on Sunday night.
According to the police, a mob clashed with the police on Sunday when two police officials had gone to Shahpur to apprehend a local man allegedly involved in a cow-slaughter case. As the crowd swelled, stone pelting began and the police opened fire and lobbed tear gas shells to disperse the crowd.
Ashraf Khan, resident of Pathar Wali Masjid locality in Shahpur, was killed in the firing by Crime Branch officials. “He sustained a bullet injury in the stomach and lost a lot of blood,” A.K. Sharma, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) told The Hindu.
Khan is named as an accused in the FIR registered by the police against 15 persons on charges of rioting and attempt to murder.
The police fired five rounds from their pistols and lobbed nearly 70 tear gas shells.
The festival of Eid turned into an occasion for mourning for the devastated family members of the deceased. They told The Hindu that Mr. Khan, a tailor, was returning from work when he got caught in the crossfire. They alleged that he passed away on Sunday night itself, but the police and the hospital authorities, where the youth was admitted did not declare him dead for fear of sparking tension on the eve of Eid.
“We want to know who killed my son, who fired. I want justice for my son,” Naseem Bano, the mother of the deceased told The Hindu. Mr. Khan was slated to get married on October 19.
Previously on two occasions, similar scuffles took place between the people and the police on the issue of cow-slaughter and animal cruelty. In the run up to Eid, the police, as well as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, had stepped up checks on rustlers.
“There are many people who are involved in the illegal trade of cow-slaughter as the cow is cheaper than the goat. Also, many a times, animals are found crammed in vehicles which also amounts to animal cruelty,” Mr. Sharma said.

NEW DELHI: Over the top telecom player Skype today said it will stop calling facility from its application on mobile and landlines within India from November 10.
"As of November 10, 2014 Skype will end support for calling within India, meaning calls to mobiles and landlines from Skype within India will no longer be available," Skype's parent company Microsoft said in a statement.

It added that Skype WiFi and SMS messages are also available to users in India.
People prefer to use Skype for making free calls using Internet service. The application has witnessed increasd adoption with boom in smartphone in India.
Telecom operators in India have made hue and cry over applications like Skype cutting their revenue share.

MFL plans modern logistics parkUpdated: October 6, 2014 22:14 IST
MFL plans modern logistics park
N. Anand
fertiliser
Madras Fertilizers Ltd (MFL) is scouting for a joint venture partner to develop a portion of its vacant land into a ‘modern logistics park’.
MFL has already appointed a consultant to study the feasibility of developing a modern logistics park at a cost of over Rs.280 crore.
The company has about 130 acre of vacant land within its premises and four acres at Manali New Town.
The company is located between Chennai Port and Kamarajar Port/L&T Kattupalli Port with road and rail connectivity. The Park will come up within the main premises. About 51 acre have been earmarked for the propose park that is expected to house a container freight station, inland container depot, scientific warehouses with cold storage, and auto carriage with all infrastructural facilities.
The consultant, it is learnt, has submitted three reports. The first two pertain to the advantageous, and the last one is about land use plan, project and operation costs and revenue and profitability factors.
The consultant is reported to have suggested an upfront payment of Rs.66.62 crore by the promoter for the land and also an assured minimum revenue share of 7 per cent to MFL.
The revenue share will increase at the rate of five per cent every year up to 30 years, according to company sources.
MFL board will meet soon to float a tender to select the partner after getting formal approval from Department of Fertilizers. The consultant has been asked to study the worthiness of the new partner, the financial status and infrastructure facility.
“We have several options lined up for this project. It may come up on BOT (build, own and transfer) public-private-partnership or joint venture model. The idea is to make better use of the vacant land to earn more revenue,” aver a top official of MFL.

Why Careers Are a Thing of the Pastreddit
Story of the Jacks
"Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a f**king big television, washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers ... Choose fixed interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home." Such goes the life advice Irvine Welsh gave to Generation X in the opening of his antihero novel Trainspotting. 20 years later, the Generation Y, also called millennials, is redefining professional success and personal status symbols.
Career? Nowadays it is commendable to drop out of college to become an entrepreneur. In fact, Silicon Valley billionaires such as Peter Thiel have even set up " dropout grants " to support students who are wishing to drop out of school to start a new company.
Family? It is fine to live together permanently with no strings attached and no kids.
Big television? Already a relic, as social media have replaced the time millennials used to spend watching television.
Car ownership? According to a 2014 study of the Rockefeller Foundation, 66 percent of millennials rate "reliable public transportation" as one of the three most important factors in deciding where to live. Go, figure.
Home ownership is also no longer hip, as millennials are renting instead of buying . On the cool scale, living permanently in a luxury hotel or serviced condominium is the new having a mansion in the suburbs.
In short, millennials don't like commitments, and jobs are no exception. The average millennial is expected to change between 15 and 20 jobs in the course of his or her working years; long gone is the lifelong loyalty to a corporation with steadfast servitude for years on end, waiting for the next promotion.
"My résumé doesn't fit into a page!" complains the quintessential "Jack" at the age of 28. As a millennial born between the early 80s and late 90s, Jack has long discovered that job-hopping is the secret to success in an intensely competitive world. "Why bother with a career when there are no guarantees?" he asks, having held a variety of unrelated jobs in six short years, despite his background in chemical engineering at a prestigious college.
Thanks to the failure of social safety nets, especially after the Great Recession, the millennials have grown cynical of long-term careers and all the benefits associated with it such as prestige, job security and a hefty pension. Entrepreneurship is on the rise and accumulating experience in a job is not as important as it used to be.
How did this happen, and all so fast?
Let's be honest. The demise of specialized careers had already started with the rise of liberal arts education whereby somebody who studied anything can go on to work in anything. A guy like me who studied political science in college could then go on to become a management consultant-turned-pharmaceutical manager-turned-reporter-turned-technology entrepreneur, with still decades to go in the work force.
To add to that came the worldwide web, which trivialized specialization. Thanks to the virtually infinite amount of organized data on the Internet, we all started acting as single-serving physicians, handymen, gym instructors, publishers, cooks, photographers, psychologists, translators and many more in various points of our daily lives.
Specialization was once the virtue of the most prized worker. "The division of labour [...] increases very much dexterity of the workman," Adam Smith had observed in his seminal Wealth of Nations, but modern trends are tearing apart the Smithian order of capitalism in favor of the Jacks of the world.
Story of the freelancers
It is only in the last few years that the jack-of-all-trades transformation of the labor force has become relevant for everyone. Increasingly, it is not only the Ivy League kids and the tech whizzes who shun traditional careers. The zeitgeist they have created is trickling down all the way to unskilled labor. And that is made possible by the rise of mobile applications.
By allowing real-time exchange of information over a purpose-built computer program, mobile apps are now used by many ordinary men and women to monetize their time, rather than a hard-earned skill.
Instead of being a cook or plumber for life, they are now getting paid as a cook, plumber, driver, bodyguard and many other professions simultaneously on an hourly basis. Within a few years of their launch, companies such as Uber and Lyft have turned regular guys with cars into part-time taxi drivers, while companies like FancyHands let people do others' chores on daily rates and those like HourlyNerd allow more sophisticated freelancers to sell consulting projects by the hour.
Generalist entrepreneurs and their freelancers are shaping the new order of business. So, what does this mean for the world?
For one, it means that more full-time jobs will be replaced by part-timers because it is mutually efficient. Just as auctioning off time by the hour affords the freelancers to maximize the financial return on their time, along with personal schedule flexibility, it also allows the companies to hire labor only as needed, scale up and down as demand fluctuates and not worry about cumbersome layoff processes.
In fact, by 2020, more than 40 percent of the US workforce will be so-called contingent workers, according to a study conducted by the software company Intuit.
This also means that with the rise of mobile applications and the so-called sharing economy we are finally nailing the coffin of specialization. The future of business belongs to many careerless entrepreneurs with good ideas, their hourly freelancers of all trades and the investors who will back their ventures.

Why Your Company Resists Innovation  and What to Do About Itreddit
I recently gave a presentation to the Innovation Partnership Program, an initiative from Singularity University where execs from Fortune 500 companies get to meet with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.
The goal of this get-together is to help these companies look over the horizon, see the future that's coming, and better prepare themselves to take advantage of it.
Executives will take these lessons back to their companies, and hopefully drive innovation within their organizations.
But it's going to be tough work. In fact, most will fail.
Truly disruptive ideas are first seen as bad ideas
Once you get a glimpse at the future, you need to innovate, to disrupt the status quo. You need to come up with new and better ideas that will let your company adapt to the future.
But here's the thing, truly innovative ideas - the ones that provide a leap forward - are, at first, seen as bad ideas by almost everyone. Even worse, the experts in the field will have a lot of valid evidence of why it's a bad idea (after all they call it conventional wisdom, not breakthrough wisdom).
The truly disruptive and innovative ideas are unwelcome. If everyone thought they were good ideas, they would have already been implemented.
Important new insights happen when people overturn the accepted wisdom.
Companies resist innovation like an immune system
Even if an idea is good, trying to get it implemented within an already successful company is hard work.
The average organization resists innovation like a body's immune system resists disease. A company is made up of individuals, and each one has a chance to quash challenging new ideas. That's the smart move, the safe move. Add up the collective opinion of everyone involved within the company, and you've got a powerful force pushing in the opposite direction of disruption.
Embracing new ideas requires being comfortable with the real prospect of failure. A core competency of running a successful company is eliminating failure. And so, successful companies develop that immune system by default. They achieved market dominance through innovation, and yet they inherently resist innovation to maintain their hold.
Consider Kodak
If you want to see this cycle play out, consider Kodak, best known for its dominance over film photography for over a century. It began to struggle in the late 1990s because people started adopting digital camera technology.
Technology that Kodak invented.
Even though it invented the future of photography, and had a dominant market position which it could have exploited, Kodak was incapable of taking advantage of this opportunity.
Imagine the strength of Kodak's internal immune system battling against the innovation of digital technologies.
Shield and protect innovation
Most companies are aware of this immune system, but they're incapable of resisting it, in the same way that you can't control your body's immune system directly. They've come up with a few clever ways to protect innovation within their organization, to give it a fighting chance.
One idea is the creation of a Skunk Works , named after the famous group within Lockheed-Martin that developed many of its famous aircraft designs, like the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird.
The term "skunk work" now means to create an autonomous team within an organization, freeing it from the bureaucracy and control that would kill off innovation.
This is moving in the right direction.
Search outside for breakthroughs with incentive challenges
An even more effective method of driving innovation is to push the search for ideas outside the organization itself, with incentive challenges: award a financial prize to anyone who can reach a breakthrough.
This idea is hundreds of years old.
The Longitude Prize awarded a huge sum to anyone who could determine longitude on Earth within a few dozen nautical miles. The Orteig Prize encouraged Charles Lindbergh to attempt the first non-stop flight from New York to Paris. And more recently, the Ansari XPRIZE provided $10 million to the first private vehicle to reach space.
The government's DARPA advanced military research group has run a series of incentive challenges seeking breakthroughs in autonomous vehicles and battlefield robotics.
In each case, breakthroughs were achieved in an unconventional method by surprising innovations.
Outside of the organization's immune system, crazy ideas are able to be tested and considered without being resisted at every level.
Instead of limited innovation within the organization along a few directions, you can literally have tens of thousands of people working on your problem, racing to find the solution.
It's only once they've been proven to work, are they brought back into the organization to be implemented.
Incentive challenges work
The number of successes in innovation challenges are countless. The Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X Challenge provided a way to extract spilled oil from water that was 10x more effective than traditional methods.
Goldcorp offered a $575,000 prize to find new deposits of gold in their mines and have turned this into more than 8 million ounces of new gold discoveries.
The marketplace for challenges is huge and growing even bigger. According to a recent McKinsey report, investment in incentive prizes over $100,000 exceeded $330M in 2010 .
That's why I'm bullish about incentive challenges. I think they offer one solution to the problem of innovation. They allow disruptive ideas to reach their potential, before they get quashed by the company's immune system. It's a model that is proven to work.
You spend the same money (actually, usually less), and only pay for results - when the breakthrough has been achieved.
The XPRIZE Foundation - the organization that has run many of the recent incentive challenges - thinks this model will work for a wider audience. That's why they spun off HeroX , a platform where ANYONE can create and run an incentive challenge.
I know, it's kind of meta. Test a new idea in incentive challenges by spinning off a new platform.
Christian Cotichini is the CEO of HeroX.com , an open platform for incentive competitions.

The Number of Public Sector Jobs Has Not Exploded Under ObamaNo openings for him in the public sector.
Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
This article originally appeared in Business Insider .
If you think the Obama administration has been characterized by a big expansion of government employment, you're wrong.
Advertisement
Bill McBride at Calculated Risk has updated his charts of public sector payrolls under President Barack Obama and his recent predecessors.
Calculated Risk
As you can see, it's not even close.
Obama in the dark blue line has seen a sustained and violent slump in public sector employment since he became president, and we're not even close to closing the gap.
Reagan had a brief decline in public sector employment, but it came back fast. All the other presidents saw only gains on this measure.
So what's the takeaway?
Partisans will point out that Obama doesn't deserve any "credit" for the decline in government employment, because most of it has happened at the state and local levels.
And that's true as far as it goes, but it misses the simple story, which is that the Obama economy is facing a headwind that simply has not been seen in decades. If it hadn't been for the collapse in public-sector employment, the jobs picture would currently look much brighter than it is.

I've been amused along the way by GOPpers pretending to be all about job creation as they cut jobs right and left in the public sector during a recession and economic recovery. Great plan guys!   More...

By: Helene Cooper
It is hard enough to push away family and friends, shunning an embrace or even a shake of the hand to protect yourself from Ebola. But imagine trying not to touch your 2-year-old daughter when she is feverish, vomiting blood and in pain.
Precious Diggs, 33, had heard all the warnings from public health workers here in Liberia. But when her toddler, Rebecca, started “toileting and vomiting”, there was no way she was not going to pick her up. “Na mind, baby,” Diggs whispered in her baby’s ear. “I beg you, na mind.”
Here in the heart of the worst Ebola outbreak in history, the question of whether to touch a stranger has only one answer: you don’t. But even in more intimate circles, in families and among lifelong friends, Liberians are starting to pull away from one another.
Liberia used to be a tactile place. Everybody kissed friends, strangers and cousins, regardless of whether people met every day or had not seen one another in 20 years. The double-cheek kiss was the standard greeting. People often held hands while singing hymns at church, and after services sometimes took up to an hour to disperse, going systematically from cheek to cheek. At parties, new arrivals took the hand of each seated guest as they bent down to kiss and chat.
That’s all gone now. Ebola is spread through bodily fluids: vomit, blood, faeces, tears, saliva and sweat. Close contact has become taboo.
The Liberian government has decreed that taxis — which used to cram up to eight people — take just three people in the back seat. Sylvester Vagn, 40, said that even with only two people sharing the taxi with him, he jams his body against the door now. Whichever arm is closest to his fellow passengers, he places it across his body and practically out the window. “And I bring jacket.”
Clara K Mallah, 27, wears long sleeves, pulling them over her hands whenever her 3-year-old niece comes running up to her. She makes an exception only for her 52-year-old mother, a diabetic amputee who never leaves the house. “If my mom could walk,” she said, “I wouldn’t touch her.”
Those family ties expose the fragility of the belief that you can completely protect yourself from Ebola by keeping your hands to yourself. Can you really not touch an ailing mother?
When Ephraim Dunbar, 37, got a phone call in late August that his mother had taken ill, he rushed to her house in Dolos Town, the enclave near Harbel where dozens of people have succumbed to Ebola. He found her in bed, vomiting blood. He did his best not to touch her. But as she grew worse, he gave her milk, and tried to soothe her. His skin touched hers. His mother died the next day.
Just after his mother’s funeral, Dunbar got fever. For 15 days, he fought Ebola. When he got out of hospital, he found out that four of his sisters, his brother, his father, his aunt, his uncle and his two continued…

You can be the bearer of bad news and still be loved by your staff.
Most bosses want to be liked. But as a manager, you sometimes have to deliver bad news, enforce the rules, assign dreadful projects, and give critical feedback. However, if you're a truly great leader, your employees will like and respect you despite those occasions.
In a recent LinkedIn post , Bernard Marr, an enterprise performance expert and author of " 25 Need-To-Know Key Performance Indicators ," shares 10 signs you're a great boss. Here are some of our favorites:
 
1. You have a clear vision and effectively make decisions.
"The captain must steer the ship," Marr says. The best managers have a clear vision of the department or company's future that he or she can communicate to their employees.
Effective bosses are also effective decision makers, Marr adds. They don't overthink every tiny thing. "Being able to make decisions quickly and decisively — and then take responsibility for the outcome (see No. 2) — is an important business skill, especially when managing others," he says.
 
2. You hold yourself and others accountable.
Most bosses hold their staff accountable, but the best ones hold themselves accountable, too. "This means adhering to the same guidelines [you] set for [your] employees and taking responsibility for both team successes and failures," Marr says.
 
3. You don't micromanage.
"The best bosses understand the art of delegation," Marr explains. "They don't interfere in the day-to-day and minute-to-minute workflow or processes. In essence, learning to delegate instead of micromanage is about trust."
 
4. You put your employees first, and show appreciation for them.
Great managers understand that there must be a balance between the company or client's needs, and the needs of their employees, Marr says. "The best bosses are willing to listen and talk about any issues an employee may be having because they understand that a happy employee is a more productive employee."
They also give deserving employees a pat on the back, and "understand the importance of recognizing and appreciating employee contributions," he explains. "This doesn't have to mean bonuses or fancy corporate awards, but regular and meaningful expressions of appreciation."
 
5. You're dedicated, but have good work-life balance.
You can't be a truly effective and respected manager unless you're passionate about your work. Marr says the best bosses "live and breathe their jobs and strive to do the best work possible," yet they have lives outside of the office, and understand the need to balance work and family, and work and play. "And they set a good example of how to do that for their employees."

SEBIs attachment proceedings cross 1 500-markregulatory policy and organisation
As SEBI tightens noose on defaulters and market manipulators, the number of attachment proceedings initiated by the market regulator against those having defaulted on payment of penalties has crossed the 1,500-mark.
SEBI began initiating attachment proceedings against defaulters, including individuals and companies, nearly one year ago as part of the greater powers granted to it by the government.
Since then, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has launched 1,539 attachment proceedings for the recovery of penalties imposed in as many as 449 cases.
These proceedings involve attachment of bank accounts, moveable and non-moveable properties, shares and debentures, among others.
After clearance from Parliament earlier in August, the government has notified the Securities Laws Amendments Act, which authorises SEBI to pass orders for attachment of properties, arrest and detaining of defaulters in prison and for disgorgement of ill-gotten money, among others.
Before the Act, the market watchdog was exercising this power through an ordinance, which was promulgated thrice.
The attachment proceedings have been launched by SEBI to recover collective penalties totalling close to Rs 2,000 crore imposed on various entities in matters related to violations of capital market norms.
In some cases, the attachment orders have been revoked after the concerned entities made the outstanding payments.
SEBI Chairman U K Sinha had said in August that attachment powers have helped it recover about Rs 20 crore till that time.
On October 10 last year, SEBI had initiated its first recovery proceedings by ordering banks to attach accounts of Pyramid Saimira’s former promoter P Saminathan who was penalised for various market norms violations including fraudulent trading activities.
As per a government ordinance, SEBI has been granted powers to pass orders like search and seizure, attachment of properties, arrest and detention of defaulters.
The ordinance was earlier promulgated by President Pranab Mukherjee on July 18, 2013 after the cabinet gave its approval to amend the SEBI Act, 1992. The ordinance got re-promulgated on September 16 and again on March 29.
Besides bank accounts, SEBI has also in various proceedings ordered depositories, NSDL and CDSL, to attach the demat securities accounts of the erring entities.

Indians to benefit from new Irish-UK visa dealEuropean Union
("This agreement will make…)
LONDON: India will be one of the first countries to benefit from a new joint visa scheme signed between Ireland and the UK here today.
The scheme, allowing visitors to the UK and the Republic of Ireland to use a common short-stay visa, was ratified by the British and Irish governments and will help travellers from outside the European Union (EU) move freely between the two jurisdictions on a single permit.
India and China will be the first two non-EU countries to benefit from the new regime.
The agreement was signed at the Irish Embassy here by UK home secretary Theresa May and Irish Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald .
"This agreement will make it easier and more attractive for travellers to visit both Ireland and the UK, while at the same time strengthening Common Travel Area borders," said May.
Fitzgerald said it was a "landmark scheme" that "but a few years ago would have seemed an impossibility".
"It is truly remarkable, and a potent symbol of the transformation in British-Irish relations, that the home secretary and I are today jointly launching an initiative of unprecedented cooperation between our countries," she said.
Fitzgerald said it was "an historic development in the operation of the Common Travel Area", the arrangement that allows free movement between UK and Irish citizens.
"Our aim is to boost tourism and business travel to our countries and, together, we are sending a clear and powerful message that these islands are open for business," she added.

This is what happened after the Supreme Court passed on same-sex marriage casesBy Abby Ohlheiser October 6 Follow @abbyohlheiser

On Monday, the Supreme Court’s surprising decision to pass on five same-sex marriage cases caught officials in Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana and Wisconsin — not to mention many gay couples in those states — off-guard. The decision effectively cleared the way for same-sex marriages to begin in those five states.
In Virginia, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals announced that it would issue a mandate at 1 p.m. allowing same-sex marriage to begin in the state.

After that happened , some clerk’s offices were crowded with eager couples celebrating the decision, and waiting to get marriage licenses.

Several county clerks announced decisions to immediately begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses. But thanks to the surprising timing of the decision, many early-adopting offices found themselves waiting around for couples to show up. In an e-mailed statement to The Post, Monroe County Clerk Linda K. Robbins said that her county office in Indiana would begin issuing “marriage licenses to all couples, regardless of gender.” But no one had shown up by late morning. “I am so surprised,” she said. “We have had a lot of calls, and perhaps they are making better plans since it appears to be no need to rush it.”  
In Clark County , at least one couple was done waiting.

Milwaukee County Clerk Joseph J. Czarnezki told The Post that his legal counsel advised his office that it could begin issuing licenses “as soon as we received word” of the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear the case. But, he said Monday morning: “Nobody’s come in yet.”

You really do love your dog like its a babyBy Rachel Feltman October 6 Follow @rachelfeltman
He's just part of the family. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)
Scientists have validated what you already knew: The love you feel for your pup can be downright maternal.
In a small brain-imaging study published in PLOS ONE , Massachusetts General Hospital researchers had women look at pictures of their young children and their dogs — as well as unfamiliar babies and dogs.
"There was a common network of brain regions involved in emotion, reward, affiliation, visual processing and social cognition when mothers viewed images of both their child and dog," the study states . But unfamiliar photos didn't have the same effect.
The results suggest that these brain networks may be important in forming and maintaining strong emotional bonds, the researchers said in a statement .
But brain response to children and dogs wasn't entirely the same: An area of the brain vital to processing faces was activated more by a dog picture than a child's face, while parts of the midbrain were more active in response to children. It may be that facial cues are more important in human-to-dog communication, given our lack of common language. And the midbrain areas could be vital in forming human-to-human pair b0nds, National Geographic reports .
These results aren't exactly surprising. For many young Americans, dogs seem to be replacing children as a late-20's family addition. And since previous studies have indicated that dogs form bonds with their "parents" in much the same way that human babies do, it's only fair that we love them back in the same way.

Simple trick to see if earnings will be goodThis one simple trick, discovered by a doctor, tells you if earnings will be good or bad

Do you want to know if a company’s earnings will be good or bad? Of course you do. And this one simple trick, discovered by a doctor, will help you do it.
Michael Probst, AP
No, really. The doctor in question, Eric So, holds a doctorate in business administration from Stanford, so he’s someone you should listen to in financial matters. And the simple trick really is pretty simple.
The indicator you should watch: Whether or not a company changes its earnings reporting date, and whether than change moves the date forwards or backwards.
Not surprisingly, if the date moves up, the news is usually good. If it moves back? Probably not good. Professor So, who is the Sarofim Family Career Development Professor and an assistant professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. says the simple rule is human nature. People rush home to tell their families good news, and tend to keep quiet about bad news.
Professor So looked at eight years’ of earnings announcements – 19,000 firms between 2006 and 2013. Firms that move up their announcements earn 2.6% more than the firms that delay announcements over the month following earnings calendar revisions.  “The magnitude of this mispricing is massive,” So said in a statement.
He said he believes that investors overlook the significance of the date shifting because it is typically announced as a simple calendar listing. “It comes across as a boilerplate disclosure that doesn’t appear to contain information about the nature of the news, only when the news is to be announced,” he said.

Mondelez posts 64 per cent rise in PAT in 2013Mondelez India Foods posts 64 per cent rise in PAT in 2013
Sagar Malviya, ET Bureau Oct 7, 2014, 12.46AM IST

(The company's profit after…)
MUMBAI: The Indian unit of Mondelez, maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo biscuits, crossed Rs 5,000 crore revenue mark last fiscal, more than doubling sales in three years after investing heavily in sales and route-to-market expansion.
The company also bucked the trend by posting 23 per cent income growth at Rs 5,324 crore for the year ended December 2013, at a time when the overall consumer market grew in single digit including global peers Nestle, GSK Consumer and Hindustan Unilever.
The company's profit after tax rose 64 per cent to Rs 498 crore, thanks to higher sales of premium chocolates such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Silk . Over the last two years, Mondelez more than doubled its visicoolers count in Indian retail outlets to 1.5 lakh and took big strides by expanding into rural India, a spokeswoman for Mondelez India Foods said.
Although India is one of the fastest growing markets for chocolates, domestic sales of the commodity had fallen with consumers spending less due to the economic slowdown a year ago.
Despite the cloudy outlook, Mondelez invested $200 million, or aboutRs 1,230 crore, to build the country's largest chocolate manufacturing plant near Hyderabad.
"In addition, we have invested close to $190 million over last three years towards brownfield expansion," the spokeswoman said.
This fiscal, Mondelez has been betting on its global innovation platform to boost sales. Its new launches include luxury brand Cadbury Glow, liquid centre-filled chocolate tablet Silk Caramello and 5 Star Chomp .
The company said its market share in its largest category, chocolates, has increased for nine consecutive quarters, while beverages now account for a fifth of its overall sales after expanding Tang.
Experts, however, feel that the biggest sales push for Mondelez was due to biscuit category worth over Rs 25,000 crore and the largest category within consumer products industry. "Just a single percent market share in biscuits category could add Rs 250 crore in sales, but the segment is also high volume-low margin business, which could impact profitability in the long run," said an analyst at an international brokerage house.
India is already the third largest market for Oreo globally and the company claims that the brand has become the leading premium creme brand in India in terms of market share.
Mondelez dominates the Rs 6,832 crore Indian chocolate market with 70 per cent share although the market is getting crowded and more competitive. Perhaps the fastest growing player, Ferrero now has almost 8 per cent market share in the market while Nestle holds around 18 per cent.
Mondelez is keen to change its Indian arm from a core chocolates company into a complete foods player. "In our minds we have a specific timeframe for Mondelez India to move from a chocolates company to a foods company," Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and CEO of Mondelez International, had told ET in an exclusive interview in August. "We chalk out our strategic plans for around three years and within that three years period I would say we will be there. We are taking that time to do that, it is our expectation that we will be a fullfledged multi-category company over the course of next couple of years," she said.

HP split latest in CEO Whitmans career of r...BlackRock
SAN FRANCISCO: BlackRock chief investment strategist Jeffrey Rosenberg and Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anand Srinivasan discuss what's behind Hewlett-Packard's decision to split into two companies and the challenges the business faces going forward. They speak on "Bloomberg Surveillance."
Meg Whitman shelved plans to spin off Hewlett-Packard's personal-computer business when she became chief executive officer three years ago. Now, she's reversing her position.
After struggling to turn around the company since becoming CEO in 2011, Whitman is adopting a plan to split Hewlett-Packard's PC and printer divisions off from its enterprise hardware and service groups. It's a scenario she rejected as recently as last year, saying more time was needed to restore the company's stature as the innovator that put Silicon Valley on the map.
"If you try to hive a division off, it's really hard because you almost have to recreate the whole thing," Whitman told Bloomberg News in 2011.
Last year, Whitman defended her strategy for the company, saying it "will be one of the great comeback stories in American business."
Even though she has rejected a splitup of Hewlett-Packard before, Whitman, 58, is no stranger to reinventions.
Before running Hewlett-Packard, she pursued a career in politics and made an unsuccessful run at becoming California's governor. Before that, she ran online marketplace EBay for a decade, following stints at Hasbro, floral service FTD Cos ., Stride Rite and Walt Disney .
"She may have to shift gears now, from having been a very prudent, careful CEO, to being a CEO who's getting the ball moving," said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor.
Hewlett-Packard said on Monday that it plans to split into two separate companies, a personal-computer and printer business, and corporate hardware and services operations.
Whitman will lead Hewlett-Packard Enterprise , a business focused on corporate hardware and services, while Dion Weisler, the vice-president in charge of Hewlett-Packard's personal-computer and printer operations, will become CEO of that business.
Whitman has been introducing new products and on Monday she expanded a job-cut program to more than 55,000 jobs to trim costs. Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, California, has fallen behind in mobile computing at a time when consumers have migrated to smartphones and tablets, and last year lost its place as the largest maker of PCs to Lenovo Group.
The split represents a reversal for Whitman, who ruled out a spinoff of the company's PC division months after replacing Leo Apotheker, who had floated that possibility earlier that year. Whitman has since reiterated Hewlett-Packard's commitment to the PC business on numerous occasions.
"The reason that we remain committed to the Personal Systems Group is no one understands computing better than HP," she said at Morgan Stanley's technology and media conference in February of last year.
Whitman has described the PC and printer groups as critical divisions for Hewlett-Packard, saying that they generate cash and offer compelling returns.
Now, both are spun off into their own company, leaving Whitman with close oversight of Hewlett-Packard's enterprise group, which will compete directly with International Business Machines, Oracle and a slew of startups seeking to sell hardware, software and services.
Other technology companies have already embarked on massive restructurings.
IBM sold its PC unit to Lenovo in 2005 and last week closed the sale of its low-end server unit to the Chinese company. Last month, EBay announced that it would spin off its Pay-Pal unit.
Whitman has been putting out fires since she took over the helm at Hewlett-Packard. The 2011 acquisition of UK software company Autonomy forced Hewlett-Packard to take an $8.8-billion write-down and mired the company in lawsuits that continue to this day.
"The kind of turmoil that HP has had at the top of the company can take a toll on companies, employees, shareholders," Whitman said at the company's Discover conference in Las Vegas in June 2012.

Miranda July Designed A Purse And It s Everything You Hoped It Would Bereddit
Writer slash performance artist slash filmmaker slash app developer Miranda July is now also a fashion designer. She recently collaborated with leather goods brands Welcome Companions on a new bag, titled "The Miranda." The portable satchel is a chic, red leather number which, in typical Miranda July fashion, is totally cute and normal.
Just kidding! It's basically a piece of moveable art, obviously. The unassuming bag doubles as a survival kit for all the needs of a lady millennial on the go. There's a miniature nightie for sleeping in a strange bed, a bottle of Calm SR homeopathic pills, a single almond for low blood sugar and a USB flash drive labeled "Ultra Top Secret Projects."
There's also a collection of "multi-purpose cards" that may or may not be well received in real-world scenarios. One alerts shopkeepers you're allowed one free item from the store, while another politely requests more lubricant.
" Although it is often the exterior of the handbag that we notice ,” Welcome Companion designer explained to The New York Times, "it’s also interesting to have the interior be a public part of identity."
She added: "your stuff is also a kind of companion."
July works her magic in the video above, explaining the various tricks up her little bag's sleeve, and thus continuing to bridge the gap between art and life. The avant-garde accessory toys with the notion of needing a consumer good, placing a literal survival kit within it.
For more of July's recent enchanted inventions, we direct you to " Somebody ," her new social messaging app that turns the world into a performance piece.

The next battlefield for workplace gender discrimination is artificial turfIt's harder than it looks.(Rob Kinnan/USA Today)
SHARE
Zainab Mudallal @Zainab_Mudallal
October 6, 2014
It will be eight months until actual play begins, but already the Women’s World Cup in Canada next June has become a battle—ostensibly between natural grass and artificial turf, but really about sexism.
Some of the world’s best women soccer players are arguing that the plan to play the tournament on artificial turf, unlike the natural grass in the men’s World Cup, is gender discrimination. They’re  filing a lawsuit (pdf) against the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA).
Artificial turf, which is cheaper because it requires so little upkeep,  has been slammed in the soccer world , with athletes saying it’s terrible for the game, and that the hard, rough surface causes injuries. Welsh soccer star Gareth Bale, who plays for the Spanish club Real Madrid,  twisted his ankle while playing on an artificial turf field, and later called it the worst pitch he has ever played on.
Every men’s World Cup since 1930, including the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, has been played on grass. The incoming tournaments in Russia and Qatar will feature grass surfaces.
If you’ve played the game yourself, you know the field plays an important role: The ball bounces and rolls around differently on plastic than on grass. The surface temperature of synthetic turf is also  significantly hotter than natural turf, which puts athletes at risk of dehydration and overheating.
And because the friction of the plastic turf exposes players to scrapes and burns that aren’t an issue with natural grass, players’ cautiousness can also change the way the game is played—reducing the excitement for viewers. A 2013 survey of top female soccer players found that they were 80% less likely  (pdf, page 6) to attempt slide tackles on plastic turf.
Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) August 13, 2014
A survey of Major League Soccer players found that an overwhelming majority said they felt plastic turf would increase their chances of injury, soreness, and longer recovery times after playing a match.  One study  (paywall) suggests that playing on artificial turf puts a further strain on your joints and leg muscles than grass does. Another study found the best combination to reduce strain and prevent ACL injuries is natural grass and cleats .
The players’ proposal, that the tournament’s six venues be temporarily equipped with natural grass, is estimated to cost a little more than $3 million dollars —a negligible expense when compared to the estimated $14 billion  that FIFA spent on this year’s men’s World Cup.

Hong Kong protests fade; students vow to carry on
AP Oct 6, 2014, 10.59PM IST

democratic reforms
(Lester Shum, a leader…)
HONG KONG: The students whose calls for democratic reforms sparked the most dramatic challenge to authorities since Hong Kong returned to Chinese control are vowing to keep up the fight.
But as the numbers of protesters dwindled Monday from tens of thousands into the hundreds, it was unclear where the tumult of the past week would lead.
Schools reopened and civil servants returned to work after protesters cleared the area outside the city government headquarters, a focal point of the demonstrations that began Sept. 26. Crowds also thinned markedly at the two other protest sites, and traffic flowed again through many roads that had been blocked.
In the Mong Kok district, the site of weekend clashes in which mobs tried to drive the demonstrators out of the intersection they were blocking, hundreds of curious onlookers surrounded the remaining protesters Monday evening, taking pictures.
"The threats in Mong Kok have passed, and now people are just curious about the sit-in,'' said 36-year-old Anita Lee, a resident. "That's why there are more onlookers than protesters."
Many in Hong Kong are wondering if the protest movement may have run its course and whether the students have a clear strategy for pressing their demand that all candidates for the city's top leader, or chief executive, not be screened by a pro-Beijing committee.
"They can't sustain attendance in protests if it goes on and on," said Michael Davis, a professor at Hong Kong University. "They need some strategy where they can withdraw the crowds so they can say to the government that if they are not sincere, they will mobilize crowds back on the streets."
Disagreements were evident after the students and the government began preliminary talks.
Lau Kong-wah, the undersecretary of constitutional affairs, said late Monday that the government and students had agreed on terms for the talks, including that the two sides would be on an equal footing.
Lester Shum, a leader of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, confirmed the agreement, but said they had not discussed or reached a consensus on the agenda.
Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who has rejected the protesters' calls for him to resign, said in a TV address Monday that the government would seek "a sincere dialogue on political reform."
At the same time, Leung reiterated that everyone should go home and stop blocking the streets.
"There are lots of teenagers and students with passion who love Hong Kong in various assemblies. However, some of them are aggressive and use violence. No matter what your attitude is toward Occupy Central, the police will firmly take enforcement action to those who use violence," he said.
  The students say they would walk away from the talks if police, who fired tear gas and pepper spray on unarmed protesters Sept. 28, use force to clear away the remaining demonstrators. The police violence and attacks by mobs drew huge crowds in a massive show of support.
"It's up to the government now. This is the first step, but the pressure has to continue," said Alex Chow, one of the student leaders.
The leeway for negotiations appears limited since Leung and Chinese officials have said Beijing will stick to its decision to screen all candidates for top leader, which many in Hong Kong say amounts to reneging on its promise of universal suffrage.
One option would be to convince the government that having open nominations for chief executive is not as big a threat as the potential for further protests.
In that sense, "I think they can already declare victory in this round 1 of their movement," Davis said. "There's a contest for the hearts and minds of Hong Kong people going on, and protesters have clearly won round 1. They have the public support and sympathy."
While they might be weak in coordination and strategy, the protesters' youthfulness and the movement's lack of central leadership have added to their appeal. Lawmakers and pro-democracy politicians have played almost no role in the movement, which began as Occupy Central _ a campaign founded last year by law professor Benny Tai. But Tai and other Occupy leaders have let several student and grass-roots political groups lead the protests.
One faction, Scholarism, is led by 17-year-old Joshua Wong and draws many younger students, while the Federation of Students represents mostly university students. Still other protesters say they follow no particular group or leader.
Differences and confusion within the movement became clear Sunday, when several leaders announced a retreat from key sites, while others declared there was no withdrawal or urged protesters to regroup in one main area.
Still, the protesters share a common agenda.
"There is still a remarkably consistent demand for genuine democracy," said Alvin Y.H. Cheung, a visiting scholar at the US-Asia Law Institute. "There is a striking unity of purpose."
The young activists also have shown an impressive knack for coordination and planning. Although the sit-ins formed spontaneously, they were disciplined and doggedly nonviolent. The youths camped out in the middle of city streets, organized ample supply lines and kept the "occupation" areas as litter-free and orderly as possible.
By Monday, many of the remaining protesters in Hong Kong's Admiralty district and across Victoria Harbor in Mong Kok were undeterred by their dwindling numbers but admitted they could not afford to neglect work and school much longer.
But 18-year-old Louis Chan said he was not sure achieving free elections _ the students' original goal _ is likely.
"I did think it was possible, but now I don't think so because they (the Hong Kong government) didn't give any response and China is also very much against this," he said.

Gas prices continue to evaporate, fall close to 2014 lows

Good times at the gas pump roll on: gasoline prices have slipped close to the lowest levels of 2014 and are poised to head even lower.
Nationally, regular grade unleaded  is averaging $3.28 a gallon. But some areas of the U.S. are paying just $2.75 as falling post-summer demand, ample global crude oil inventories and surging supplies provide consumers a break heading into the last quarter of the year.
The switch to cheaper winter-blend grades and plunging ethanol prices should keep prices on the downslope.  Already, 10% of the nation's gas stations are reporting sub-$3 a gallon gasoline. A year ago, just 3% were.
"It's like a biggest loser competition, where every corner of the continent is shedding at least a few pounds of fuel weight,'' says Tom Kloza, senior oil analyst for price tracker gasbuddy.com.
"If you're not seeing your cheapest fuel costs of 2014, you'll see new 2014 lows soon,'' Kloza says. "We're looking at something just north of $3 a gallon for the national average."
Monday's 2.6-cent gallon drop - the biggest daily drop in 11 months - came despite a late day uptick in crude oil and wholesale prices Monday.
Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude ended up 74 cents to $90.48 a barrel, while Brent crude - which touched 27-month lows earlier Monday - ended up 63 cents to $92.94. Wholesale gas for mid-November delivery closed up 3.4 cents to $2.41 a gallon. But futures prices for December through February are hovering at $2.35 a gallon.
Average Joe motorists aren't the only ones getting price breaks. Truckers who rely heavily on diesel grade are also seeing falling prices, down to $3.71 a gallon Monday, vs. $3.89 a year ago.
Still, slumping oil prices continue to pummel drillers. Among the day's losers: Diamond Offshore Drilling; down 2% to $33.67, Transocean; off  2.6% to $30.94, Chenier Energy; down 1% to $76.55, and Chesapeake Energy; off  2% to $21.33.

Paulson: AIG bailout designed to be punishment
Josh Boak, The Associated Press 3:39 p.m. EDT October 6, 2014
Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson walks to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims October 6, 2014 in Washington, DC. Paulson will be a witness and testify in a class action lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by shareholders of AIG claiming that the government violated their rights by grabbing a majority stake in the company as part of the 2008 bailout of AIG.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The 2008 government bailout of American International Group was specifically designed to punish the insurance giant, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in U.S. court Monday.
The $85 billion loan package extended to AIG — then reeling from the financial and housing crisis — gave the government control of 80% of its stock. Unlike other major financial firms rescued in the middle of the worst economic downturn in roughly 80 years, Paulson said that AIG shareholders should have faced punishment for their troubled balance sheet as part of any rescue.
Paulson's testimony came as part of a lawsuit brought by former AIG chairman and CEO Maurice Greenberg. The 89-year-old is suing the federal government for damages of roughly $40 billion, saying that it violated the Constitution's Fifth Amendment by taking control of AIG without "just compensation" in return for the shares.
Paulson's successor as Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, and former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke are also scheduled to testify this week.
On the witness list: Paulson, Geithner, Bernanke
Federal officials didn't want troubled financial institutions to assume they could receive a bailout without any negative consequences. Otherwise, it might encourage those firms to engage in reckless behavior. This concept known as "moral hazard" applied to AIG but not other banks because of the multiple pressures that existed in the market in September and October of 2008.
At the time, financial investors known as short-sellers were betting that shares in AIG and prominent banks such as Citigroup would continue to plunge. Paulson said that his goal was to stabilize the financial system, which meant that the government offered less punishing terms to the banks being bailed out in order to limit the market freefall. But few other insurers faced the same risks as AIG, so the Federal Reserve-backed loan could punish shareholders to prevent moral hazard.
"I believe the Fed-designed AIG terms were appropriate," Paulson said in testimony at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. "I didn't see any other insurance company that was vulnerable or like AIG."
Greenberg's lawyer, David Boies, pressed Paulson in court about whether the former Treasury secretary was overly harsh on AIG in order to quell public anger and pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program. At the time, some congressmen were reluctant to pass the $700 billion TARP, a program to buy troubled bank assets that could be viewed by critics as a giveaway to Wall Street.
Paulson said he contacted both 2008 presidential candidates — Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain — and emphasized that AIG shareholders were being punished as part of the bailout.
AIG "certainly was a scapegoat for Wall Street and all the bad practices that people were angry about," Paulson said.
The government eventually provided AIG with $182 billion in loans, which have been repaid. AIG has since returned to profitability, and its stock has risen more than 45% over the past two years to more than $52 a share.
Since 2008, the company has sharpened its focus on its core insurance business, selling non-core units such as International Lease Finance for $7.6 billion. ILFC, now owned by Netherlands-based AerCap Holdings, leases aircraft.

Modi yet to deliver  wait on for him to spur economy: Jim RogersBrent crude oil
("Many global investors…)
Many global investors are still somewhat exuberant about India's prospects after Narendra Modi became the prime minister, but some of them are beginning to worry in the absence of results, said legendary maverick investor Jim Rogers.
In an interview with ET, Singapore-based Rogers, who co-founded Quantum Fund with another celebrity investor George Soros in the 1960s, got candid when he said he is buying India's stock index while staying away from gold for a while. Excerpts:
How do you rate the performance of the new government under Narendra Modi?
So far, Modi does not seem to have produced results, which we all expected him to do. He said a lot of wonderful things, but so far nothing has happened, other than a lot of public relations.
Do foreign portfolio investors share your view? What is the mood among these investors because their inflows have slowed in the last two months?
The mood about India is still somewhat exuberant because Modi is still very popular since the last elections. But some people have begun to worry about how long this honeymoon period will go on.
Modi has not done much to change the economic outlook of India. People are waiting to see when Modi is going to change its economic policy, or start opening up of India to outside world. The expectations are very high because Modi at some point of time has to come up with some concrete proper actions.
What will be the impact of interest rate hikes by the US Fed next year on markets?
Most central banks follow the market, and the market dictates what has to happen. In the US, interest rates have already started going up a bit, and they will continue to go higher, in my view. The US central bank will be forced to cut back its bond purchases and probably they will, and that will lead to higher interest rates.
At some point, we are going to have interest rates that will affect markets though that may not happen for a while. But when it happens, central banks will panic, the US central bank will panic and then they all will again start buying bonds in order to calm down the markets. Then again, interest rates will come down for while, and there will be bubble in the markets.
How do you see emerging markets like India getting impacted from the US Federal Reserve interest rate hike?
Emerging markets will get impacted from the US Federal Reserve interest rate hike. Last year, it scared lot of people, including the best of the emerging markets, when the tapering of quantitative easing was announced. When the market goes down by a fair amount, central banks will panic, and they will say "Don't worry, we will help you". Yes, it's going to affect everybody, especially the emerging markets.
 
You have been a big Gold Bull for a while. What is your view on it (gold prices have tumbled to its lowest level in 15 months to below $1,200/ounce)?
I have not been buying gold for a long time. I hope that I may get another chance to buy gold some time this year or next. If gold prices drop below $1,000/ounce, I hope to buy a lot more gold. Meanwhile, I have not bought nor sold gold though I have hedged some of my gold.
So, what are you buying these days?
I am buying stock index in India, stock index in Russia. I am long on fertilisers and agriculture commodities as I expect prices to go up. I am overweight on the US dollar. I am overweight on Japanese blue chips as pension funds there are adjusting their portfolios. I am overweight on China as the government is emphasising its economic plans for the next 20-years.
Why are you buying US dollars now? Are you betting on the US economic recovery?
The US dollar is partially gaining strength because there is turmoil in the markets; people are worried about the Middle East, Russia, and when people are worried, they quickly resort to the US dollar to make payments. The US dollar is not safe haven anymore, but people don't understand that. As long as there is turmoil in the world, the dollar will go higher and higher, and this will hurt many countries and economies. And my plan is when the dollar goes higher and higher, I will sell the dollars. Having said that, currently I am long on dollars.
Do you think Brent crude oil will fall further from the current levels (it has fallen over 20% since June this year to hit a 27-month low)?
We are going to have a bit more correction in crude oil prices and some commodities. I hope to buy some commodities when this correction goes far enough. The world is running out of oil in most countries, and the bull market in crude oil is still not over in my view. When crude oil goes down further, I would rather buy the commodity than sell.
Some of the emerging economies, including India, are showing signs of recovery. Is it sustainable?
Well, that has been true for most part of the world because vast amount of money has been pumped into Japan, America, Europe, and the UK. Whether the recovery will last or not I don't know. But these are all artificial money which has been pumped in to rest of the world.

Boom in job mkt back Recruiters predict 2007-like big demand for talent soonAjit Isaac
(The real recruitment spree…)
MUMBAI: Boom times back in the job market? Recruiters think so. Hiring data for the July-September quarter shows a two-year high and more than half a dozen recruiters reckon levels last seen during the 2007 boom will return in the next few months. The real recruitment spree will come when employers focus on talent for new jobs. Right now, the hiring is brisk thanks mostly to vacant positions being filled.
Top-Level hiring to be up after lag
For Bangalore-based Ikya Human Capital Solutions , the July-September period topped recruitment closures of the last seven years. "We closed around 4,000 positions in all, including 3,000 in temporary staffing. This is more than any quarter till seven years ago," said Ajit Isaac , chairman and MD of the recruitment firm that looks after middle order and temporary hiring. "There is a demand for managing directors in automotive, manufacturing and infrastructure projects," said R Suresh, managing director of RGF Executive Search.
The Japan-headquartered company also touched a 13-month high in its India numbers and closures were significantly higher than same period last year." Another recruitment company that looks mainly at IT middle management hiring said the two-year high includes counter-offers. "This is also good news because it shows mobility in markets and that candidates are willing to look at changes," said the company head, who refused to be named. Also clocking in its best quarter in a couple of years was Bangalore-based The Head Hunters.
Mandates for this recruitment company come from ecommerce, engineering and consumer sectors, according to Kris Lakshmikanth , chief executive of The Head Hunters (India). This September, the recruitment firm hired four senior members for a Canadian company that has operations in Chennai; the posts had been vacant for a while. Staffing companies like Randstad India as well have touched their two-year best this September. "Action from the new government is yet to be seen on ground but we expect larger orders to come in," said Aditya Narayan Mishra, president (staffing) at Randstad India. TeamLease clocked in its highest number of closures in 18 months.
"The number of openings per client has gone up. Earlier, if they wanted one person for the post of a bank manager, they are asking for five now," said co-founder and senior vice-president Rituparna Chakraborty . Brisk hiring will, however, not be in conjunction with any drastic changes in salary structures. Increment levels will be around 15-40% when changing jobs and compensation packages will see more long-term incentives. Hiring for top level talent is also expected to pick up - but after a lag.

Prices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki on Monday priced the Ciaz aggressively - a strategy it has successfully adopted on many of its cars — to take on sprightlier rival models Honda City and Hyundai Verna that rule the country's crowded market for mid-size sedans. The Ciaz is priced between Rs 6.99 lakh and Rs 9.80 lakh in Delhi, before local levies and insurance.
The Hyundai Verna starts at Rs 7.39 lakh and go up to Rs 11.72 lakh for the top-end variant, while the Honda City costs between Rs 7.19 lakh and Rs 11.05 lakh. Maruti is playing the price card to gain traction over the rivals.
The City leads the local market, accounting for one in every two cars sold. In the first five months of the current fiscal year starting April, Honda sold 30,447 City sedans, while Hyundai's Verna followed with 15,462 units. Maruti had sold 802 units of the SX4 sedan, which the company stopped producing in August, before it launched the Ciaz.
Maruti and its vendors together had investedRs 620 crore for developing the Ciaz, which has 98% of its contents sourced locally. It offers two engine options: a 1.4-litre petrol power plant and a 1.3-litre diesel engine. According to the company, the diesel variant delivers 26.21 kilometers to a litre of fuel, the highest for any car manufactured locally.
Maruti is banking high on the Ciaz to keep its sales momentum going after posting a 15% jump in sales so far in the current fiscal year.
"We have designed this car keeping in mind the needs and expectations of the Indian sedan customer. The diesel Ciaz is India's most fuel efficient car today and comes with great looks, plush interiors, and offers generous room and comfort," managing director and Chief Executive Kenichi Ayukawa told reporters on the sidelines of the launch. "We aim to sell around 80,000 Ciaz in the first year and would also export it to the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. "Maruti has started taking orders for the car last month and has got so far got around 10,000 bookings.

Mondelez rides high on Cadbury chocolate demandMondelez India Foods posts 64 per cent rise in PAT in 2013

(The company's profit after…)
MUMBAI: The Indian unit of Mondelez, maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo biscuits, crossed Rs 5,000 crore revenue mark last fiscal, more than doubling sales in three years after investing heavily in sales and route-to-market expansion.
The company also bucked the trend by posting 23 per cent income growth at Rs 5,324 crore for the year ended December 2013, at a time when the overall consumer market grew in single digit including global peers Nestle, GSK Consumer and Hindustan Unilever.
The company's profit after tax rose 64 per cent to Rs 498 crore, thanks to higher sales of premium chocolates such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Silk . Over the last two years, Mondelez more than doubled its visicoolers count in Indian retail outlets to 1.5 lakh and took big strides by expanding into rural India, a spokeswoman for Mondelez India Foods said.
Although India is one of the fastest growing markets for chocolates, domestic sales of the commodity had fallen with consumers spending less due to the economic slowdown a year ago.
Despite the cloudy outlook, Mondelez invested $200 million, or aboutRs 1,230 crore, to build the country's largest chocolate manufacturing plant near Hyderabad.
"In addition, we have invested close to $190 million over last three years towards brownfield expansion," the spokeswoman said.
This fiscal, Mondelez has been betting on its global innovation platform to boost sales. Its new launches include luxury brand Cadbury Glow, liquid centre-filled chocolate tablet Silk Caramello and 5 Star Chomp .
The company said its market share in its largest category, chocolates, has increased for nine consecutive quarters, while beverages now account for a fifth of its overall sales after expanding Tang.
Experts, however, feel that the biggest sales push for Mondelez was due to biscuit category worth over Rs 25,000 crore and the largest category within consumer products industry. "Just a single percent market share in biscuits category could add Rs 250 crore in sales, but the segment is also high volume-low margin business, which could impact profitability in the long run," said an analyst at an international brokerage house.
India is already the third largest market for Oreo globally and the company claims that the brand has become the leading premium creme brand in India in terms of market share.
Mondelez dominates the Rs 6,832 crore Indian chocolate market with 70 per cent share although the market is getting crowded and more competitive. Perhaps the fastest growing player, Ferrero now has almost 8 per cent market share in the market while Nestle holds around 18 per cent.
Mondelez is keen to change its Indian arm from a core chocolates company into a complete foods player. "In our minds we have a specific timeframe for Mondelez India to move from a chocolates company to a foods company," Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and CEO of Mondelez International, had told ET in an exclusive interview in August. "We chalk out our strategic plans for around three years and within that three years period I would say we will be there. We are taking that time to do that, it is our expectation that we will be a fullfledged multi-category company over the course of next couple of years," she said.

(The number of such career…)
MUMBAI: A couple of years ago, Kartick Maheshwari left Zia Modyled law firm AZB & Partners to work in Singapore, but soon found that major Indian deals were no longer being done there or in Hong Kong - they had moved to India. So he looked to return and discovered that along with the work, Indian law firms had developed a voracious hiring appetite. After just about nine years of work experience, Maheshwari returned as a partner at Khaitan & Co., handling mergers and acquisitions and private equity.
The number of such career moves in the legal profession has been unprecedented this year and law firms big and small are still looking to recruit. In addition, lawyers working at firms overseas are seeking opportunities to come back. "This return is motivated by a perceived glass ceiling at international firms and the early signs of juicier work that is flowing to firms in India," said Lee Ignatius, co-founder of Vahura, a recruitment company that specialises in legal talent.
International law firms usually ensure they part on good terms with lawyers heading back to India so that they can have a network of friends in the country, where they face restrictions on setting up offices, said Chris Parsons, the Londonbased Chairman of the India practice at Herbert Smith Freehills. The law firm has about 20 Indian lawyers, mostly working in the UK.
"English law in particular is so similar that the skills are desirable and can be transposed," said Parsons. "In a way, you can say this is the coming of age of the Indian legal profession," said Vandana Shroff, who handles people matters at Amarchand Mangaldas, India's largest corporate law firm, in Mumbai. "We at Amarchand have started taking lateral hires even at partner level, but our sweet spot really is the 3-5 years of experience lawyers." Zia Mody, Managing Partner at AZB & Partners, said the demand is resultant of a buoyant capital market and infrastructure practice triggered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi coming into power as well as debt restructuring after the drive to curb bad loans.
The firm, which so far has had partners who have risen internally, has been more open to recruiting seniors in recent times to address a "further deepening of domain" as the market booms, she said. While senior lawyers are looking to move back to bigger firms for stability, younger one are stepping out to set up new practice areas in emerging firms, seeking opportunities to make a name for themselves for their work rather than the firm they represent. Gauri Chhabra recently quit Amarchand Mangaldas and joined Economic Laws Practice as a senior associate because the larger firm already had an established competition law practice with three partners across Mumbai and Delhi specialising in it. "The headroom to grow here is much more.
I am directly dealing with clients, generating work and getting the opportunity to be known for my work as well as the firm's," Chhabra said. Chhabra initially did not expect an opportunity from an emerging firm. She had considered rival tier-I law firms, but was happily surprised to find interest from a couple of smaller firms willing to offer her more autonomy.
"Firms are willing to pay a premium of 15% to 20% more than last year for a suitable lateral hire," said Dalfi Vakharia, a senior consultant at Vahura. Amarchand's Shroff adds that the rise in hiring is also due to the increasing complexity of Indian law and onshore deals. Khaitan & Co, which has been one of the more active senior recruiters in the past few years, looked for "people who were unhappy or felt a mutual need for the firm," said Haigreve Khaitan, a senior partner at the firm.
They found a significant number of Indian lawyers from international law firms. Mody of AZB says that while this has been the trend for the past five years, the spots available for them have risen only in the past year.

Merely funding NGOs not enough; philanthropists like Amit Chandra helping to build their 'capacity'

(Amit Chandra's years of…)
The week-long programme on strategic perspectives in non-profit management (SPNM) that Zeena Johar of SughaVazhvu Healthcare attended at Harvard Business School (HBS) in Boston recently left her bleary-eyed and exhausted. Her typical day would start at 4 am and continue till late in the evening; the class went through 26 case studies in a week.
For Johar, who drives an innovative primary healthcare programme in 50 villages of Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu, SPNM exposed her to radical new thinking and to the challenges — and allures — of scaling. She came away impressed with a new financing mechanism — social impact bonds — that is gaining currency in the West. "The peer conversations were also quite enriching," she says.
Johar was part of a small group of NGO leaders who were at this HBS course courtesy Dasra, a Mumbaibased strategic philanthropy foundation, and Amit Chandra, managing director of Bain Capital Advisors and a philanthropist. "Building abilities to scale is core to our interventions," says Deval Sanghavi of Dasra.
Chandra picked up the entire programme tab and he wants to make it an annual event. It fits into his new giving journey of focusing exclusively on capacities of NGOs after having funded numerous projects in healthcare, education and skills for over a decade. His years of exposure to the Indian social sector have left him with the belief that the sector can reach the next level only if a sustained effort in supporting NGO capacities is made. The development challenges in India are huge. All along we have had a few deeply passionate individuals trying to make a difference on the back of their charisma and some capabilities. This, he says, is not enough.
Capacity Depletion
The trigger for him to set his sights on capacities was the new Companies Act, which mandates companies of a certain size spend 2% of their net profit on corporate social responsibility activities. The impediments are many. Where are the social-sector vehicles to address issues on scale? Do our NGOs even have the mindsets, organisational structures or human capital to forge collaborations with government and corporates on developmental challenges?
Development experts say the situation is grim. "In fact, over the years, there has been a significant capacity depletion of NGOs," says Rajesh Tandon, president of the New Delhibased Participatory Research in Asia. "Capacity building is reduced and equated to mere training programmes." More often than not, the socalled capacities enabled by institutional donors, and even the government, are only about how to spend — keeping books, and adhering to monitoring and other needs of funders.
Support for real capacities, he says, are ignored. The capacity-building ecosystem has been distorted. Perhaps the involvement of professionals and philanthropists from the corporate world, with their hands-on feel of the fundamentals of capacities, may alter the scenario.
Understanding Capacity
The complex nature of capacity building has kept philanthropy away from this space all along. Donors would like their monies to be linked to measurable outputs: number of children in school, litres of water treated, skills and jobs provided, or medicines/services delivered. But how do you measure capacities? It rarely occurs to donors that unless the organisation itself is robust, it will struggle to deliver the goals sought of it. Lending inner strength to an NGO also requires money and support. Even institutional donors prefer to fund programmes and squirm if an NGO seeks money to spend on itself.
The 'invisibility' of capacity is quite galling to most. Answers to questions — is it a learning organisation; how does it relate to other actors; is it endowed with team spirit; is it resilient — can be quite elusive and difficult to pin down. Sometimes, experts say, it's not visible to the organisation itself, leave alone outsiders.
  The intangible nature of capacity is implicit in one of the most acceptable definitions of capacity: the ability of a human system to perform, sustain itself and self-renew. Capacities can also be influenced by many factors, including local conditions, resources available, and even by leadership ambitions or the lack of it. "NGO leaders are often heavily constrained by the system and also their own imagination," says Chandra. "We have to break out of this."
Today, in India, there are millions of small NGOs slowly chipping away at huge developmental challenges. The multitude doesn't even have the capacity to absorb a budget above `10 crore. Even Bangladesh has a BRAC, a development organisation with an annual expenditure of $718 million in 2013 (about `4,000 crore) and reaching an estimated 135 million people. It is perhaps the largest NGO in the world. Tandon, though, attributes the growth of BRAC to the political economy typical to Bangladesh.

Hong Kong protest leaders said late today they had agreed to hold talks with the government as their numbers dwindled.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
HONG KONG: Hong Kong protest leaders said late today they had agreed to hold talks with the government as their numbers dwindled and they faced growing pressure to end their pro-democracy sit-in.
The mass rallies that had drawn tens of thousands evaporated last night in the face of a warning from Hong Kong's embattled leader Leung Chun-ying to leave the streets and allow government offices to reopen.
Many heeded the call but several hundred weary demonstrators remained at the main site in downtown Admiralty, with similar numbers across the harbour in Mongkok.
Student leaders denied their campaign for free elections had lost momentum, saying they would remain on the streets, even as they announced that talks with the government would take place this week.
But Leung issued another warning to disperse, saying they should leave the flashpoint district of Mongkok -- which has seen ugly scuffles with triad mobs -- "as soon as possible".
"To prevent violent crime and to reduce the amount of injuries, police will take action at the right time," Leung said in a televised address, describing the area as "high risk".
The protesters and their well-organised campaign have enjoyed strong public support, with sympathy soaring after police used tear gas on the crowds. But after shutting down parts of the city for more than a week, irritation has grown.
Highways were jammed with traffic and subway trains were packed as frustrated commuters tried to find their way to and from work, battling cancelled bus routes and road diversions.
"They have to let the cars through as soon as possible -- they are blocking the way," 25-year-old Michael Lau said as he travelled on the city's tram network.
A four-day environment symposium gathering 11 Nobel winners that was due to open on Wednesday has been scrapped "due to the sustained disruptions in the city," organisers say.
However, secondary schools closures in affected areas, which had been a particular headache for families, were lifted and the government said primary schools would reopen tomorrow.
"To demonstrate is one thing -- but don't affect our livelihoods any more, because we have rent to pay," said a fruit juice seller who gave her name as Mrs Hau.
But some backed the protesters. "I don't mind the extra time I spend getting home. I support the students," Judy Kwan, a nurse, said.
"Some of my family think it's a little annoying, but we all want real democracy so it's worth it."
Those protesters who remained were battling fatigue today, as the energy of a once-euphoric campaign began to subside.

Banking on diversityPosted: October 6, 2014 12:03 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 4:55 pm
A diversified banking sector can help promote viable businesses, further social goals.
Ashima Goyal
Diversity lends strength to any ecosystem — a monoculture tends to be fragile, especially in the financial sector, where following each other’s strategies builds risks. So even though public sector bank ownership is often attacked as a weakness, a diversified banking system may be a source of strength.
Freer post-reform entry resulted in an even split in ownership by 2009-10: 27 public sector banks (PSBs) with majority government ownership, 22 private sector banks, and 32 foreign banks. PSBs, however, still dominated, with 75 per cent of the assets of the banking system. But this was less than their 1991 share of a little over 90 per cent. With diverse ownership in place, policy now aims to diversify by activity-type.
Changes in relative competitiveness illustrate the benefits from diversity. The public sector did unexpectedly well after the reforms of the 1990s, and even overtook private banks on some parameters. It also outperformed them during
and immediately after the global financial crisis.
Reforms reduced excessive government ownership. A new philosophy of regulation shifted from micro intervention to a strategy of macro management. High growth and legal reform that made debt recovery easier also contributed to non-performing assets (NPAs) falling to historic lows. As a ratio to gross advances, NPAs fell to 2.4 per cent in 2009-10 from 12.8 per cent in 1991. There were structural improvements in the health of Indian banks.
Systemic failures were also avoided. The Basel Accord capital standards were implemented as part of the reforms, but a standardised version was followed. Given diverse capabilities, banks were allowed learning time to migrate to internal risk rating-based capital buffers. It was feared that the lack of historical data for wholesale and retail, together with the absence of industry benchmarks to be used in the calculation of internal parameters, could distort risk-based pricing. Indian capital adequacy norms were kept higher than the Basel norms to make sure risky exposures were not undercapitalised, despite the difference in approach. Additional prudential (safety) norms included risk weights and provisioning requirements that effectively moderated sectoral booms. Simpler regulation based on broad patterns was used partly because the skills for complex risk-based regulation were missing, but turned out to have good stability-enhancing incentives. A risk assessment methodology not based wholly on self-assessment was protective.
Features such as high leverage, short-term market-based funding, risky endogenous expansion of balance sheets and exposure to cross-border risks, which had led to massive bank failures in the West, were limited. Most banks followed a retail business model. Loans dominated market investments on bank balance sheets. But this varied by bank type. In 2010-11, contingent liabilities as a percentage of the group’s total liabilities were 41.4 per cent for PSBs, 167.9 per cent for private banks and 1,892.7 per cent for foreign banks. Although technology and skills improved, PSBs lagged behind private banks in systems, fee-based services and use of sophisticated products and derivatives. Or perhaps this reflects the choice of a different business model. Business continued…
Errors are possible, but stronger boards  and improved governance mechanisms can ensure that independent banking decisions are made on purely commercial grounds.

Bullet trains  in perspectiveWith ‘Make in India’ the new buzzword, foreign collaborators should be encouraged to set up plants to manufacture rolling stock and other machinery for broad gauge requirements.
Written by Ashwani Kumar | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:29 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 1:43 pm
They will have to be integrated with the existing rail network.
Bullet trains are a marquee project for the Narendra Modi government and foreign companies are falling over themselves to get a share of the pie. But in a hurry to get bullet trains running, the government must not make strategic blunders.
Technology and financing are no longer real constraints in bringing high-speed trains to India. Competing foreign collaborators are willing to offer generous financial terms and technology transfer. The key issues are financial viability, optimal resource utilisation and benefits to the people. Answers to these questions are more involved and depend on our strategic choices. These decisions will have profound long-term implications for the commercial viability of not only bullet trains, but also the Indian Railways (IR).
It is important that bullet trains fit into our overall vision for rail transport. The vision should be to provide the country with a fast, safe and comfortable passenger rail system. Besides speeding up Shatabdi-type day trains and overnight trains, journey time for the longest-running passenger trains should be reduced to less than 24 hours. Building a few isolated high-speed corridors will not fully serve the purpose, but integrating bullet trains with the existing IR network can help provide faster, direct connections to a large number of cities in the hinterland. Improving the accessibility of smaller cities would reduce the pressure on the megacities. It can also catalyse the development of “smart cities” as envisaged in the budget.
Currently, the inter-city passenger demand estimate is the main criterion to assess the financial viability of a high-speed corridor. But integration of these corridors with the IR can help reduce journey time for a large number of existing train services. These additional network benefits can make many new high-speed corridors economically viable. Irrespective of their management structures, bullet trains should have a symbiotic relationship with the IR system by improving the efficiency of the existing rail network while gaining extra ridership by leveraging it. This requires interoperability of trains so that tracks and terminal infrastructure can be shared.
Interoperability entails a compatible choice of track gauge, train sets, locomotives, signalling and traction systems. Track gauge is the most crucial and contentious of these. The world over, standard gauge is adopted for high-speed trains. But India has a pre-existing broad gauge network. Many experts argue that the adoption of broad gauge for bullet trains would lead to higher construction costs, delays in rolling stock procurement and difficulties in technology transfer. However, the long-term costs of not adopting broad gauge for the high-speed network will be higher. There is already a project underway to convert different gauges to continued…
With ‘Make in India’ the new buzzword, foreign collaborators should be encouraged to set up plants to manufacture rolling stock and other machinery for broad gauge requirements.

Rhetoric signifying somethingBy putting their signature to these protocols, the leaders are not just looking to address the issue of energy security and climate change. They are also creating the platform upon which to build a long and durable strategic partnership.
Written by Vikram S Mehta | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:48 am
Unlike so many past communiques, the India-US vision document is granular in content and far-reaching in aspiration.
Only the most churlish would argue that the prime minister’s visit to the US was more style than substance. The vision statement released at the end of the dialogue between PM Narendra Modi and US President Barack Obama was substantive. It covers almost every topic of potential interest between the two countries in language that is short on diplomatic jargon and long on actionable intent. Earlier, through simple but powerfully delivered messages at various public fora and the masterful initiative to announce visas on arrival for Americans, the PM not only brought India back to the attention of the US Congress and American business, but also put to bed the legacy that had dogged him for the past decade. He also struck a massive chord with Indian Americans.
The task ahead is clear. The PM has to find the political will to deliver. This will not be easy. The slogan “Chalein Saath Saath: forward together we go” may have rhetorical resonance, but there is no getting away from the reality that the journey ahead for both Obama and Modi will be like walking a tightrope. In reading the section on energy and climate change, for instance, I could not but recollect that it was not long ago that 212 members of Congress voted against Obama’s climate change bill and that the representative from Georgia, Paul Broun, asserted that climate change was a “hoax” perpetrated on the world by the scientific community. His remarks drew broad applause. In a similar vein, Manmohan Singh came under strong criticism from the opposition when he endorsed the goals set at the Major Economic Forum to limit the increase in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius and for agreeing to “substantially reduce emissions by 2050”. Against this backdrop, it could be justifiably asked how the two leaders will deliver on their intent.
The same question could be asked of most other issues brought out in the vision statement. For, they too have been bogged down by seemingly irreconcilable national and vested interests. The civil nuclear deal has been stuck in the mire of unlimited liability; trade and facilitation discussions have stalled over the matter of food subsidies; visa and immigration issues raise the hackles of some Congressmen and the US trade representative may still recommend sanctions against India for its continued…
By putting their signature to these protocols, the leaders are not just looking to address the issue of energy security and climate change. They  are also creating the platform upon which to build a long and durable strategic partnership.

Federal judges tosses 5-second rule being used to police Ferguson protestsBy Wesley Lowery October 6 Follow @WesleyLowery
In the first formal blow to the policing tactics being used in Ferguson, Mo., a federal judge ruled Monday that the “5 second rule” — a policy being enforced by some officers that required protesters to be moving at all times during demonstrations or be subject to arrest — was unconstitutional and violated the protesters’ First Amendment rights.
“The practice of requiring peaceful demonstrators and others to walk, rather than stand still, violates the constitution,” U.S. District Court Judge Catherine Perry wrote in the ruling — which clarifies that police are still free to use any number of other tactics to manage the crowds that have gathered to protest each night since the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown.  “This injunction prevents only the enforcement of an ad hoc rule developed for the Ferguson protests that directed police officers, if they felt like it, to order peaceful, law-abiding protesters to keep moving rather than standing still.”
From the early days of the protests — which have fluctuated from dozens to hundreds on some night, primarily to call for the arrest of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Brown — police have used varying tactics to manage the crowds. In mid-August, some officers began instructing demonstrators of a new, so-called “five-second rule,” under which protesters were instructed that they must remain moving at all times and that they could not remain still for more than five seconds. Legal observers sent by national organizations quickly decried the rule, and protest leaders insisted that it was an attempt to undermine their right to demonstrate.
“Vague rules that are applied in a haphazard fashion tend to increase community tension,” said Tony Rothert, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri. “Judge Perry’s injunction is a huge win for peaceful protesters and those who believe in the rule of law.”
The ruling, which comes after the ACLU formally challenged the policy on constitutional grounds, comes as top law enforcement officials continue to insist that they never formally instructed officers to carry out such a policy.
Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who was in charge of leading the policing efforts for several weeks during the protests, said that he had not heard of the rule until the lawsuit was filed. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who has formally taken over jurisdiction of policing the protests, told The Post in an interview Monday afternoon that his officers would not be enforcing any such policy.
“I never heard of such a rule, that wasn’t anything that we had put into policy, practice or procedure,” Belmar said. “We’re not going to do a five-second rule.”
However, Post reporters on the ground in Ferguson witnessed officers on several nights instructing protesters that they must continue to walk up and down the street or else they would be placed under arrest.
“Citizens who wish to gather in the wake of Michael Brown’s tragic death have a constitutional right to do so,” Perry wrote later in the ruling. “But they do not have the right to endanger the lives of police officers or other citizens. The police must be able to perform their jobs, and nothing in this order restricts their ability to do that.”

Flipkart should focus on customers and not the competition

(The easy thing for Flipkart…)
Clearing up once the guests are gone after a gala party is a nightmare for even the most enthusiastic and organised host. For Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, the founders of Flipkart, who threw open their doors on Monday for a Diwali bash termed as "the sale to end all sales", tidying up could prove to be a nightmare to end all nightmares.
In the span of a single day, Flipkart has managed to tarnish a reputation built over seven years. The damage is not irretrievable but the poster boy of Indian online retail must first understand why it disappointed so many on Monday. In one word, it is hubris. With its present mindset, it will struggle against the might of Amazon, and Alibaba when the Chinese company starts selling here. Flipkart must clear its head first.
The easy thing for Flipkart to fix is the technical glitches. Despite planning for months, hordes of customers were unable to buy what they wanted at the advertised price. It is not uncommon for technology to trip up online retailers and Flipkart will not be the last one to have suffered this way. The next time will be much better, of that we can be confident.
The bigger worry for Flipkart is elsewhere. Let us illustrate this with a couple of examples. The first gripe with them is that they appear to be taking the customer for granted by billing what is essentially a clearance sale as a curated event. This should not have been done before Diwali, when customers make the biggest purchases of the year. The deals ought to have been specially created with the latest products in keeping with the spirit of the festival season. This would have also been a natural barrier against competition, which stole Flipkart's thunder with deep discounts on popular brands.
Of late, Flipkart has made an effort to launch its private-label electronics and accessories but has not made sufficient progress to distinguish itself. Its attention span has been limited, with the result that it seems to be spreading itself too thin. Buying Myntra was a smart move but it does not equip Sachin or Binny with the cloak of invincibility.
Amazon and Jeff Bezos are not babes in the wood. Which brings us to our final point. When Bezos was in India last week, there was a note of triumphalism from Flipkart.
Greeting the American entrepreneur with Flipkart billboards advertising today's sale along his route was pointless aggression. Sachin and Binny are role models for a generation of aspiring entrepreneurs and they should be conscious of this.
Flipkart has enjoyed sympathy among those who regard it as an Indian success story. Through relentless pursuit of operational excellence, Flipkart is where it is today. It was not the first online retailer in India, but is today the largest because it got the basics right. Flipkart should focus on the customer and not the competition. That should be the lesson from Black Monday.

10 Eerily Adorable GIFs That Will Make You Feel Like A Kid Before Bedtimereddit
Back when you were ending your long days by being tucked into bed and read a bedtime story, do you remember feeling so moved by the illustrations that graced the pages that they seemed to jump off the page and come to life?
For kids living in this technologically enhanced age, there's a GIF for that.
( Vladimir Stankovic )
Serbia-born, Denmark-based artist Vladimir Stankovic crafts enchanting GIFs that don't just capture entire stories in each frame, but entire worlds. Mushrooms with nine eyes and spindly fingers interact with glowing aliens and woodland critter hybrids. The images, reminiscent of creepy-cute artists like Gary Baseman and Mark Ryden, channel an otherworldly sense of mystery inspired by mother nature and what lies beyond it.
( Vladimir Stankovic )
"In my work I try to combine my love and passion towards illustration and graphic design, with the use of both traditional and digital mediums," he explains on his website. "My inspiration comes from science and nature on one hand, and fantasy, fairy tales and all sorts of mysteries on the other."

Nifty50 cos lose steam  to grow at a slower rateNifty50 companies lose steam, to grow at a slower rate
ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 07.03AM IST

(Growth is likely to moderate…)
MUMBAI: Growth is likely to moderate for the Nifty50 companies in the September 2014 quarter compared with that in the previous quarter, according to the latest quarterly estimates by the ET Intelligence Group.
At the aggregate level, the 50 large and most frequently traded companies in India Inc will report 7.9% year-on-year increase in net sales and 11.4% rise in net profit for the September quarter. This compares with 16.3% growth in sales and 18.6% jump in net profit of the sample for the June 2014 quarter.
The rate of sales growth is also expected to slip to single digit after four quarters of year-on-year double-digit growth since a majority of the companies in core sectors such as banking, capital goods, construction, infrastructure, and power are taking more time than expected to show demand improvement.With core sector demand still lagging, the baton of growth will once again be passed on to a handful of sectors such as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), information technology (IT) and pharmaceuticals.
"It will be a mixed bag with sector-specific trends. Sectors such as IT, pharma and consumers will continue to do well while capital goods, PSU banks and power may disappoint," said Sonam Udasi, head of research, Tata Asset Management. Select companies in FMCG , IT and pharma sectors have been leading from the front over the past few quarters. Their share in sales and net profit of the sample was at a 9-quarter high during the June quarter. The situation is expected to continue in the September quarter as well.
The three sectors will contribute 13% to the total revenue of the sample and 26% to the net profit. During the corresponding quarter two years ago, their share in revenue was 11%, and in profit, 19%. Some industry trackers believe that the year-on-year appreciation of the rupee against major currencies may have some impact on the overall growth.
"Over the past year, the rupee has appreciated from 68 to 62 against the dollar. This is negative for revenue growth and operating profitability," said Dhananjay Sinha, research head and strategist, Emkay Global Financial Services. Sinha, however, feels that the impact of astronger rupee will be mitigated to some extent by better export volumes and improved operating efficiency.
The sample's operating margin is likely to stay at the previous quarter's level of 19.6%, helped by softening commodity prices and improved cost management. Operating margin has improved gradually from the ows of around 17% nine quarters ago.
While exports and consumer-centric sectors are holding on to the momentum, the core sector is taking time to recover. "We are not yet witnessing a clear signal of improvement in the investment cycle. It is taking more time than expected for a turnaround," said VK Vijayakumar, investment strategist, Geojit BNP Paribas .At the sector level, apart from FMCG, IT and pharma, automobiles and auto ancillary sectors are likely to report robust numbers for the September quarter.
"Auto and ancillaries will outperform due to better volume growth. Operating leverage and falling commodity prices will help in the expansion of operating profitability," said Udasi of Tata Asset Management. In the case of banking, public sector banks are likely to show higher non-performing assets. In addition, the credit growth has been lower as banks are exercising more caution while issuing loans.
Cement companies are expected to start showing signs of revival as volumes pick up. In the case of capital goods, barring Larsen & Tubro, companies will continue to struggle with subdued demand.
"A near 40% exposure to overseas markets will help L&T report good numbers," said Vijayakumar of Geojit BNP Paribas. While companies have started taking initiatives to reduce borrowings, it may be a while before the efforts help in cutting borrowing costs.
"Companies have been focusing on cutting debt. We may see a gradual reduction in overall debt levels from the third quarter. But borrowing levels of capital goods and infrastructure companies will take a few more quarters, depending on the cash flows from capitalintensive projects," said Udasi.

A Nation no Longer on Repeat...reddit
The national skills gap conversation is changing. While working in the midst of supply and demand day in and day out, our organization as well as many of our partner organizations believe that there is significant change creeping in...with an awareness of the changing education to employment system pushing for behavior change. Behavior change from federal government, higher education, K-12 education to workforce and finally, to hiring. There seems to be acknowledgement and consensus around "out with the old, in with the new" as the only way to really close the so-called skills gap in the U.S. A nation no longer pointing fingers or looking the other way; a nation no longer on repeat.
The Harvard Business School just released their 2013-2014 survey on competitiveness . The findings are strong and have a focus on the role that business can provide. Key is the impact that business makes with their investments and strategies as findings include "... business is mostly involved in fragmented, subscale efforts that alleviate weaknesses in the education system without strengthening the system for the long run" and "...tendencies in firms to hire in ways that discourage skills investments; poor information flows along the "supply chain" for talent; and inadequate collaboration among companies, educational institutions, and government."
America is changing. More jobs are requiring middle skills and two-year degrees than before. Skills vs degree is becoming a key discussion point as a study last April revealed students graduate from college with heavy debts, and many aren't reaping the benefits of that education -- a poll shows recent grads often find jobs that don't require a college degree. More than 40 percent are unemployed, and 16 percent are in part-time positions.
We are an innovative country with young people choosing their own pathways that make sense to them as the cost of the four-year degree is on the rise with less proof of return on investment. In addition, fewer young people have "four years of time and four years of money" at the same time. Young people are choosing pathways such as coding in eight weeks in a New York boot camp that gets them a job with a big bank in the City. Companies like Google are changing their hiring to focus on cognitive skills. In an interview with the Times, Lazlo Bock, the Senior VP of People Operation for Google stated, "G.P.A.'s are worthless as a criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless. ...We found that they don't predict anything." For every job...the No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability, and it's not I.Q. It's learning ability. It's the ability to process on the fly. It's the ability to pull together disparate bits of information. We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they're predictive." Bock goes on to say that a degrees and good test scores aren't negative, they just don't predict anything.
In our own research, funded by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation New Options Project we have shown that the highest predictability of job success is a composite of cognitive skills, as much as 5X more predictive than education or academic achievement and 2.5X more than experience. The most predictive other than cognitive skills is a job tryout, which is similar to an apprenticeship or internship (John E. Hunter and Rhonda F. Hunter, "Validity and Utility of Alternative Predictors of Job Performance").
The Harvard Survey on Competitiveness also raises the issue of the so-called "skills gap" in the American labor market. As Innovate+Educate continues to work with companies across the U.S. we hear that the workforce doesn't have the appropriate skills necessary for the jobs, costing large companies millions of dollars annually in additional training costs. The small businesses don't have the resources for the training and therefore have high turnover in hiring. As we work with hundreds of companies, we validate what Harvard iterated in the report...that the skills businesses need are very specific to region and industry. There is not one big U.S. labor market but thousands of regional labor markets seeking solutions to align education and training to workforce needs of businesses.
This scenario that we face as a nation requires behavior change in a big way. Businesses must change the way they hire, look at specific skills requirements for the jobs and open jobs based on skills. Education partners must not be so focused on the degree but getting their students a job at the end of the degree/credential. And government funded workforce entities must be held accountable for the training they provide to assure that it does indeed skill up the jobseeker and not continue to place them in the endless cycle of unemployed. This requires a nation in which supply meets demand and demand meets supply. A nation no longer on repeat.

Where in the world people want to work abroadSome people are perfectly happy staying where they are.(Reuters/Eric Gaillard)

Max Nisen @MaxNisen
October 6, 2014
As the world’s labor force becomes increasingly mobile in a global economy, more workers are willing to consider going abroad for a job. But people’s motivation to move—and their favored destinations—vary widely and are not easy to predict based solely on economics,  according to a new survey  of more than 200,000 job seekers from the Boston Consulting Group and recruiting website The Network.
Of course, many people in unstable or economically floundering countries look outside their homelands for more opportunity; and those in countries with a high standard of living often want to stay put. But there are plenty of exceptions, the survey found.
Spanish workers, for example, are more likely than not to stay in place, despite a weak economy. (Spain is, after all, a pretty nice place to live, even with its economic woes.) And what explains the relatively high level of wanderlust in Switzerland? The Swiss apparently don’t want to move for a better job or standard of living (which would be tough to find): When asked why they want to move, those factors are at the bottom of their priorities. Broadening experience and living in a different culture are at the top.
The variation can be pretty extreme, even among similarly robust economies. More than 90% of the French and Dutch job seekers surveyed said they’d be willing to move abroad. But less than half of German and Danish job seekers, and only 35% of Americans, would consider a move. The world average is 64%.
Here are the countries covered by the survey, broken down by the percentage who already work abroad or would be willing to:
In many countries, younger people are substantially more likely to want to work abroad. People aged 21 to 30 in the United States for example, are more than 20% more inclined to move abroad than the average person in the country. In Germany, however, the young are just 8% more open to a move, indicating a more conservative young populace and the strong pull of a stable economy at home.
Economic trends play a role, a country’s wealth isn’t the only thing that draws workers. Here are the most popular destination countries, according to the survey, which include economically troubled places like Spain and Italy:

When it comes to cities, workers aim for bright lights and big work opportunities: Capitals and cultural centers tend to draw the most people.

Investor wealth zooms over Rs 23 L cr this yearInvestor wealth zooms over Rs 23 lakh crore so far this year
PTI Oct 6, 2014, 04.26PM IST
(At present, the total market…)
MUMBAI: Stock market investors have become richer by over Rs 23.33 lakh crore so far this year, as 25.49 per cent rally in the benchmark Sensex has helped the total valuation of all the BSE listed firms reach close to Rs 94 lakh crore.
In contrast, investors' wealth had surged by over Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 70,44,431 crore in 2013.
At present, the total market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE listed companies stands at Rs 93,77,672 crore, about Rs 6.22 lakh short of the Rs 100 lakh crore milestone.
The Sensex has gained 25.49 per cent from December 31 to October 1 and touched its life-time high of 27,319.85 on September 8.
Positive investor sentiment following the formation of new government at the Centre and strong foreign fund inflows have been driving the domestic equity markets, experts said.
"The undercurrent of the stock market is bullish although stocks are currently in the consolidation phase and buying may resume in the days to come," said an equities expert.
Marketmen have maintained that the surge in investor wealth is also due to continued rise in listed firms. The total number of listed companies stands at 5,485.
Sensex blue-chip companies whose market valuation is more than Rs 1 lakh crore include TCS, ONGC, RIL, ITC, Infosys, Coal India, HDFC Bank, SBI, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Bharti Airtel, HUL, Wipro, Tata Motors, L&T and NTPC.
Outsourcing giant TCS is the most valued Indian company with a market cap of Rs 5,43,684.13 crore.
Indian markets have seen smart gains this year helped by robust foreign fund inflows.
Since the beginning of this year, foreign investors have infused a net of Rs 83,438 crore ($14 billion) in the stock markets, while they have invested a net of Rs 1.18 lakh crore into the debt market ($19.6 billion).

By Brian Winter and Paulo Prada
SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - An unexpectedly competitive runoff campaign for Brazil's presidency kicked off on Monday with leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff and her pro-business rival Aecio Neves racing to win over supporters of an ousted third-place candidate and other voters frustrated with a stagnant economy.
Neves, a centrist senator who has pushed for greater trade and lower government spending but who had been widely written off until the last few days of the campaign, rode a late surge in support to a strong second place with 33.6 percent support in Sunday's first round of voting.
He will face the leftist Rousseff, who won 41.6 percent support, in the Oct. 26 runoff that will decide what has been Brazil's most unpredictable election in decades.
Rousseff remains a slight favorite due to her enduring support among the poor, but Neves is within striking distance.
Brazil's main stock index soared as much as 8 percent early on Monday, and the real currency gained as much as 3 percent as investors were cheered by the strong showing from the candidate they preferred all along.
Latin America's largest economy has been stuck in a rut for nearly four years under Rousseff, and most of Brazil's business community and Wall Street investors have made no secret of their desire for change.
Both remaining candidates immediately shifted their focus to the 21 percent of voters who backed the third-place finisher, environmentalist Marina Silva.
Silva's campaign fell apart late in the race amid questions about her shifting views on major issues, but she remains admired by many voters and she could still help swing the election with an endorsement.
Top Rousseff aide Gilberto Carvalho told reporters on Sunday night that he had already spoken to the head of Silva's Brazilian Socialist Party, Roberto Amaral, to ask for their support.
"He asked for calm and more time to talk with the party," Carvalho said.
Most observers believe Rousseff has very little chance of winning formal backing from Silva, after unleashing a barrage of negative ads that contributed to her collapse.
Instead, her best hope may be for Silva to stay neutral, as she did after finishing third in the 2010 race, which could allow Rousseff to peel away her more left-leaning supporters.
Senior officials from Neves' Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) are hoping for a formal endorsement and they expected to meet with leaders of Silva's campaign on Monday, a party source told Reuters.
The two camps shared broadly similar market-friendly platforms and Silva's campaign chief, Walter Feldman, is a former PSDB leader with enduring ties to the party.
Another Silva aide who wields huge influence with her, Eduardo Giannetti, told reporters on Sunday night he would support Neves.
"I don't think it would be good for Brazil to have four more years of (Rousseff)," Giannetti said, according to the website for Veja magazine. "Now we have to re-establish confidence. Our best chance for that is with (Neves)."
BATTLE BETWEEN VISIONS
The runoff will be a battle between opposing visions for Brazil: the state-led capitalism of the ruling Workers' Party, and the market-friendly policies promised by Neves and the PSDB.
The two arch-rival parties have run Brazil for the last 20 years, and the campaign is already breaking down along class lines as Rousseff accuses the PSDB of favoring the rich.
More than half of Brazil's voters live in households earning less than $1,000 a month.
Polls taken prior to Sunday showed Rousseff would beat Neves by as much as 8 percentage points in a runoff.
Yet Neves' dramatic turnaround gives him clear momentum - important in a race in which most voters have told pollsters they want change from the government but also have misgivings about kicking Rousseff out of power.
As recently as 10 days ago, Neves was stuck in third place and trailed Silva by 9 percentage points. But when Silva's lack of party support and reputation for unpredictable decisions scared away voters at the last minute, Neves' consistent pro-business message and calm, presidential air won them over.
The expectation of a Rousseff victory had in recent days battered Brazilian stocks and driven the currency to a five-year low. Markets snapped back on Monday on hopes of a Neves victory.
Still, countless investors have already lost money in recent months betting on a Rousseff loss, only to see her bounce back thanks to support from blue-collar Brazilians.
Despite falling investment, weak consumer confidence and a loss of competitiveness by Brazilian manufacturers, Rousseff and her supporters blame the economic woes on international instability, not her policies. Unemployment has remained near historic lows, and wages have been steady.
To win, Neves will have to distance himself somewhat from the PSDB's last time in government, from 1995 to 2002, a period that saw important pro-market reforms but is remembered by most voters for high unemployment and painful budget cuts.
He must also convince voters that his promise to jumpstart the economy won't come at the expense of social programs, especially a popular monthly stipend that low-income families receive in exchange for keeping their children in schools.
Rousseff said on Sunday that Brazilian voters "don't want a return to the past," and called the PSDB the party of recession - even though Brazil's economy contracted under her own watch earlier this year. (Additional reporting by Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Editing by Todd Benson and Kieran Murray)

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: US stocks fell in choppy trading on Monday, with traders nervously eyeing the start of earnings season, while the S&P 500 failed to remain above a key technical level.
With top economic indicators, including payrolls, out of the way, equities had little in the way of catalysts. The recent strength in the US dollar and continued weakness in the European economy cast a shadow over the earnings season that is about to begin.
"Markets are reflecting nervousness around third-quarter earnings given the strong dollar and a very weak macro environment in Europe," said Jim Russell, senior equity strategist for US Bank Wealth Management, which manages $120 billion in assets out of in Cincinnati.
"It is very possible that estimate cuts are in front of us," he said.
Micron shares fell 4 per cent to $32.57 after Samsung unveiled plans to spend $14.7 billion on a new semiconductor facility.
Hewlett-Packard posted the S&P 500's largest gains, up 4.7 per cent to $36.87 after it said it would split into two listed companies and eliminate another 5,000 jobs.
GT Advanced Technologies , Apple's partner in a sapphire glass plant in Arizona, said it had filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection and its shares tumbled 92.8 per cent to 80 cents.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.78 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 16,991.91, the S&P 500 lost 3.08 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 1,964.82 and the Nasdaq Composite
dropped 20.82 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 4,454.80.
The S&P 500 was unable to hold above 1,975, "which is proving to be a real resistance point," said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.
The benchmark's 50-day moving average stands just below 1,975 and it has closed below that average for five straight sessions.
About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, below the 7.2 billion average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.
The largest per centage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was CareFusion, up 22.9 per cent after medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson agreed to buy it for $12.2 billion in cash and stock.
On the Nasdaq, a top mover was also related to an acquisition, with Durata Therapeutics up 74.6 per cent to $24.24. Actavis said it would buy Durata for about $675 million.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Petrobras , up 14.24 per cent to $15.96 and Bank of America, up 0.06 per cent to $17.30.
On the Nasdaq, Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, down 76.4 per cent to $1.57, joined GT Advanced Tech and Micron among the most heavily traded.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,676 to 1,383, for a 1.21-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,612 issues fell and 1,044 advanced for a 1.54-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

No women empowerment here: Female candidates get only 10% tickets in Maha pollsAshok Chavan
(Although the state has reserved…)
AURAGABAD: Just about one in ten candidates in the upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra is a woman, belying claims of women's empowerment among political parties across the spectrum and the state's rich history as home to social reform movements.
Although the state has reserved half the seats in local self government units such as panchayats and municipal corporations for women, just 82 or 10.6% of the 7,701 contestants that have filed nominations for the assembly elections are women.
While the Congress has given 27 tickets to women candidates, the BJP has fielded 21 women, the Nationalist Congress Party has 19 women candidates in the fray and the Shiv Sena just 10.
"It's not like our party has not given any seats to women in these elections. Our party has kept 19 seats quota for women. This is on the higher side compared to other parties," said Chitra Wagh, president of the NCP's women's wing.
However, she added candidly, "But every party also has to look at whether the candidate will win in a particular constituency. After all, we contest elections to win them so we have to go according to what the people want."
The NCP is contesting 284 seats while the Congress has fielded candidates from all 288 seats, the BJP has 257 candidates in the fray and the Shiv Sena is contesting 286 seats.
Even among the few women candidates in the fray, most are daughters of established political leaders. In Solapur, Sushilkumar Shinde's daughter Prantati Shinde is contesting, In Nanded, Ashok Chavan's wife Amita Chavan is contesting while in Beed, Gopinath Munde's daughter Pankaja Munde-Palve has filed the nomination.
However, leaders claim this is a step in the right direction.
"I don't think there is any discrimination between relatives of leaders and other women. We have given almost 10% tickets to women and there are many like Rajani Pawar or Susieben Shah who are not relatives of established politicians. But the ability to win is also an important consideration," said Congress leader Neela Limaye.
Maharashtra has had a tradition of political leaders' daughters or wives taking up social work and later following into their father's or husband's footsteps. Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule contested the Lok Sabha polls from Pawar's home turf of Baramati while Congress leader Sunil Dutt's daughter Priya Dutt contested general elections from Mumbai North-East constituency, as did BJP leader Pramod Mahajan's daughter Poonam Mahajan-Rao, and Gopinath Munde's second daughter Preetam is now contesting Lok Sabha bypolls from Beed. The pattern is much the same in the upcoming assembly polls as in the April-May general elections.

(New Delhi wants to exert…)
NEW DELHI: Indian and Swiss tax authorities are expected meet this month in an attempt to break the deadlock on sharing of information on citizens whose names have figured in the controversial 'HSBC list'.
New Delhi wants to exert pressure on the Alp nation following a pact between the world's key economies, G20 , for sharing information on bank accounts and tax offenders.
"There will be a meeting. Details and dates are being worked out," said a finance ministry official, adding that getting Switzerland to share details of beneficial owners of bank account holders in the HSBC list topped India's agenda.
The Narendra Modi government, which set up special investigation team to probe black money on its first day in office, has clearly outlined its focus on tackling the issue.
Indians can legally have bank accounts in foreign lands, but they are supposed to pay tax on the money parked there and also disclose the details to local tax authorities.
In the past few years, there has been a growing perception that Indian businessmen have been stashing away black money in tax havens, taking advantage of the secrecy laws of Swiss banking.
Switzerland buckled under global pressure and agreed to ease its banking secrecy laws in recent years and also signed a revised tax treaty with India in 2011 to facilitate greater flow of information on tax evaders.
But it refused to share information on the accounts mentioned in the so-called 'HSBC list' which India had received from France through a bilateral treaty. It has been widely reported that France had actually received the list after data was stolen by a disgruntled HSBC Geneva employee in 2011.
India has now escalated the issue internationally with the global forum holding discussions on information sharing in cases of stolen data in September.
The Swiss National Bank, on its website, has reported that the total deposit of Indians in their banks have increased to about Rs 14,100 crore at the end of 2013 from about Rs 8,547 crore a year ago. While former finance minister P Chidambaram had sent stern letters to his Swiss counterpart for sharing information, current finance minister Arun Jaitley too followed it up after taking over. And even though Switzerland has begun to respond in some cases, it is still resisting when it comes to the HSBC list.

NEW YORK: Facebook has closed its acquisition of mobile messaging service WhatsApp in a deal that is now worth $21.8 billion, up from the original $19 billion deal struck, thanks in part to the social network giant's rising stock price since February.
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook said Monday that it has named WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum to its board of directors. WhatsApp is by far Facebook's largest acquisition, and bigger than any that Google , Microsoft or Apple have ever done.
The deal's value raised eyebrows when it was announced on February 19, though analysts said it makes sense for Facebook to buy the popular messaging service.
WhatsApp has been growing rapidly, especially in Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia. It has more than 500 million users.

Modi s pro-tourism agenda brings signs of re...China
(To help boost tourist arrivals,…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pro-tourism agenda has brought in signs of revival in the sector, which has witnessed sluggish growth. With the peak travel season in India approaching, the industry is hopeful of a 10-15% increase in numbers over last year.
To help boost tourist arrivals, India announced the visa on-arrival facility at nine airports and the online visa application system in more missions overseas. Modi's recent meetings with leaders from China, Japan and the US have yielded investment proposals that are expected to lead to increased business-related travel to India.
Mid-market Lemon Tree Hotels, which gets almost 20% of its business from foreign travellers, expects a stronger year. "If you look at spends, countries like US, China and Japan have committed several billion dollars as investment in India and these are bound to bring in travellers into the country. In the leisure segment, our Kerala, Goa and Dehradun properties are looking strong as well for the upcoming season," says the company's president and executive director Rahul Pandit.
Online tour operator Yatra.com expects a 40% jump in business from holiday packages for the upcoming season, said Sharat Dhall, the president of the company.
India's foreign tourist arrivals in 2013 increased 5.9% to 6.97 million from the previous year while domestic tourist visits rose 9.6% to 1,145.28 million, according to the government.
Travel agencies are also banking on the improved economic environment in stronger markets such as Europe and the US to reflect positively in the upcoming tourist season here.
"Tourism in India is undergoing a transformation and there is a growing emphasis on new destinations as well, especially in the North East and Maharashtra. We are likely to see a growth rate of over 20% this coming season," says Karan Anand, head of relationships at travel agency Cox & Kings.
SM Azmat, president of sales and marketing at Jaypee Hotels , says the season is showing some promise starting this month. "October looks positive on the booking front for our hotels and this is due to the keen interest in India from the overseas market," he says.

Aditya Thackeray a new hope for Sena | MNS  Amit Thackeray being groomed for politicsAditya Thackeray
(Old timers recall how Bal…)
MUMBAI: When Shiv Sena was so completely sure of winning the 2014 polls along with its 25-year-old ally, the party—if some senior functionaries of Shiv Sena are to be believed—had even toyed with the idea of fighting the 2019 elections with Aditya Thackeray as chief minister of Maharashtra. Now, all those ideas need to be reworked. But, there is no doubt how important Aditya is to the party.
Even as a child, Aditya was interested in politics. Old timers recall how Bal Thackeray's eldest grandson would always be around for photo-ops when bigwigs of national politics came knocking at the doors of Matoshree. Old Shiv Sainiks remember seeing a an adolescent Aditya, always in the thick of action, offering tech tips to help his father Uddhav handle a new gadget or as he grew older get involved in animated discussions on politics.
Though there was no doubt about Aditya's place in Shiv Sena as Uddhav's political heir, his entry into the party was a rushed affair in 2010 after Uddhav and Shiv Sena were challenged by the cousin, Raj Thackeray , who split the party and founded the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in 2006. What rocked the Sena was the phenomenal support Raj had among the youth.
The Sena believed that Aditya could be an effective counter to Raj and undoubtedly the strategy has succeeded to a large extent. As the head of the Yuva Sena, Aditya, has managed to lure a large number of youngsters into the Sena. The 24-year-old has become so big in the family-run party that insiders say that he effectively controls the Sena and devises its strategy. For instance when BJP declared publicly that it was breaking its alliance with the Sena, it was not Uddhav, but Aditya who first responded on Twitter.
Aditya is supremely confident of his abilities and about the role that he has assumed for himself and hence, has already made a mark in the party. He has consciously nudged the party away from violence to have an image makeover and has strictly instructed Sena functionaries not any undertake violent agitations.
The Sena always drew its strength and sent political messages out through its strong local network of Shakhas spread across the state. But Aditya has taken the party beyond its shakhas to the cyber networks on "watsapp", twitter and other social media platforms. He supplemented the old political networking tools that his grandfather and the great grandfather Pabodhankar used with new age social networking tools. So, even the Michael Jackson song that plays on his mobile as one dials his number does not really come across as cultural shock for the Shiv Sainik or anyone else who engages with Aditya.
And his second cousin Amit Thackeray is one of the many who used to meet up with him frequently.

New Balance s new Hyde Park store emphasizes classics1
But New Balance, which moved into the space of a former BankFinancial branch, is not in a university-owned building and was not a university recruit. The owners were looking for a new city location and landed in Hyde Park at the encouragement of several employees who live in the area and noted the opportunity there, Mach said.
"What we were finding as we've grown the classic side of our business in Lincoln Park is that a lot of customers were coming from the South Side, as we were one of the few stores that carry the higher-end classic sneakers," Mach said. "The more we learned about the South Side, we realized there's a big need down here."
In addition to sneaker aficionados seeking classics like 998s and 574s, New Balance found many customers traveled to its Lincoln Park store from the South Side with medical referrals from doctors or physical therapists recommending the brand's range of fits, from extra-narrow to extra-extra-wide, Mach said
The Hyde Park store, at 2,100 square feet, also carries a large selection of running shoes, he said.
To cater to sneakerheads — avid collectors who can be found camping for hours outside stores like St. Alfred's in the Wicker Park neighborhood when there is a limited-edition release — Mach expects that the Hyde Park New Balance will be among several of the brand's stores across the country to sell limited-edition classics next year.
"New Balance classics are on fire all over the world — Asia, Europe, they're just on fire," Mach said. "It's bleeding into the U.S."

LatentView to double head countUpdated: October 6, 2014 22:14 IST
LatentView to double head count
Sanjay Vijayakumar
business (general)
Data analytics firm LatentView Analytics will double its head count to 1,000 in the next 18 months.
The Chennai-based 8-year-old company helps clients gather insights from data through a combination of business, data and maths.
Some of insights include aspects such as why a customer is leaving a client or why revenue per customer was going up or down in a particular region.
“We have doubled our scale especially since 2010 as we internationalised our business. Today, 90 per cent of our customers are from North America. That has had an impact on the scale of the market, and the amount the clients are ready to spend and make commitments towards further analysing their business,” said Venkat Viswanathan, Founder and Chairman of LatentView.
The firm has 25 clients, and counts Microsoft, Pepsi Co among its top clients.
Mr. Viswanathan said more than third of the firm’s employees were from business schools.
“We hire from IIMs, IITs and other engineering colleges as well as Mathematical institutes,” he added.
Going forward, the firm is looking for clients in Europe and Asia. It expects 80 per cent of its business come from the U.S., and the balance from Europe in the next three years.

 Gold Sinks to Lowest Level in 15 MonthsGovernment to Streamline Subsidies, Cheap LPG for Rich May Go: Finance Minister
Gold tumbled to its lowest level in around 15 months on Monday after better-than-expected US jobs data boosted the dollar, dampening safe-haven appetite for bullion and pushing silver and platinum to multi-year lows.
Gold, which often influences other precious metals, has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
Cash gold had fallen 0.20 percent to $1,188.37 an ounce by 08.45 a.m. It earlier dropped to $1,183.46 an ounce, its weakest since June 2013. Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low.
"A strong dollar is a major problem for gold. Sentiment is very bearish but I think we expect some kind of rebound," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, who pegged support at $1,180 an ounce.
"There's a little bit of physical buying, but premiums haven't changed. We have to see what happens later in the day. If demand is coming, of course, it will push up the premiums."
Premiums for gold were quoted at $1.20 to $1.60 an ounce to the spot London prices, unchanged from last week, despite a sharp drop in cash gold prices.
The absence of main gold consumer China is weighing on the physical market, which usually sees a pick up in demand from jewellers and retail investors when prices fall.
Chinese markets have been shut for national holidays and will reopen on Wednesday.
US gold was at $1,189.00 an ounce, down 0.33 percent.
The dollar started the week on a strong note in early Asian trade on Monday, holding near a more than four-year high touched after an upbeat US nonfarm payrolls report increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in mid-2015 or earlier.
Data from the Labor Department on Friday showed US non-farm payrolls rose 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell to 5.9 percent, the lowest since July 2008, underscoring that the U.S. economy continues to improve.
In Tokyo, sellers pushed up premiums for gold bars to 25 cents to spot London prices from zero last week to offset the decline in global prices.
"At this moment, demand is not good. But maybe when the holiday in China is over, the premiums may go up further," said a dealer in Tokyo.
Markets in Singapore, a key bullion trading centre in Southeast Asia, were also closed for a public holiday.

Maharashtra polls: Gadkari promises voters  saris  shirts ; EC issues notice114
0
New Delhi: The Election Commission (EC) on Monday issued a show cause notice to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari for "statements to the effect of inducing the voters to take bribe" during campaigning in Maharashtra assembly polls.
Holding that the statements prima facie violated the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct, the EC asked him to reply by Wednesday evening, failing which the poll body will take a decision without further reference to the BJP leader.
In the notice, the EC said district electoral officer of Latur (Maharashtra) had informed the poll watchdog that Gadkari, while addressing a public meeting in Nilanga assembly constituency on Sunday, allegedly made "statements to the effect of inducing the voters to take bribe if offered by someone and then decide how to vote".
'In these days of inflation, keep one thing in mind, eat what you wish and drink what you desire,' Gadkari had allegedly said in Nilenga, Maharashtra.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #nitin gadkari #nilenga #model code
According to the English translation of the speech made by the former BJP president in Marathi, he had allegedly said: "Now, I am watching your faces and I have some skill of predicting the future by way of face reading. You have an opportunity of "Laxmi darshan" in next 10 days. Special people to get foreign made, ordinary people to get local brand...
"All are Gandhivadis asking for Rs 5000. In these days of inflation, keep one thing in mind, eat what you wish and drink what you desire. Keep whatever you get. This is the time when illegally earned money can go to poor. Therefore, do not say no to Laxmi. But think while you vote. Your vote should be for the development of Maharashtra."
EC said his statement amounts to "abetting and promoting the electoral offence of bribery" within the meaning of Section 171 B read with Section 17l E of the IPC as it includes offering food, drink or entertainment.
Maharashtra goes to polls on October 15.
Gadkari allegedly told people that while women will get sarees, the young boys will get pant-shirt. The EC has sent him copies of the CD carrying his speech along with the translated version of the operative portion of his Marathi speech in English.
The poll panel also reminded Gadkari of sub para (4) of para 1 of the Model Code of Conduct which states that parties and candidates shall avoid scrupulously all activities which are 'corrupt practices' and offences under the election law, such as bribing of voters.

Falling prices arent the real reason to worry about bitcoinOctober 6, 2014
People are starting to notice: The bad boy of the digital currency world is losing its mojo.
Which is to say, bitcoin prices in US dollars have been heading south, hovering at just under $350 after peaking at more than $1,100 just a year ago. At one point, bitcoin was  the worst performer  of nearly any asset class.
Share
Tap image to zoom
It’s not a coincidence, either, that bitcoin hasn’t really been in the news of late, as the currency was during last year’s explosion. The crypto-currency is remarkably sensitive to media coverage , and one of the main dynamics of its rise has been the hype cycle of successive rounds of excited investors piling into the currency, much to the benefit of early adopters. For bitcoin, even bad news—like the October 2013 downfall of Silk Road, the bitcoin-driven market for a whole world of dubious goods—became good news as exposure lead to greater knowledge of the digital currency.
But the real chart that should spell worry for bitcoin investors is this one, which shows that, despite the hurly burly—and more than $100 million  poured into bitcoin start-ups by venture capitalists—actual use of the currency hasn’t really increased. Recent gains in transaction volumes have coincided with a falling price; that is to say, people are selling.

There are three stories bitcoin’s proponents tell about what bitcoin technology  could potentially do for the world: That bitcoin will become a currency used by many people to purchase goods; that it will be a superior method to store value over time; and that it can form the basis of a highly secure and efficient payments system. The volatility of the price chart suggests that storing value, at least so far in its young life, isn’t bitcoin’s strong suit. And the transaction chart suggests that people aren’t really using bitcoins more often, and efforts to market easy-to-use payments programs to merchants and consumers haven’t meaningfully expanded bitcoin use. If people aren’t using it, and its value is falling, any currency is sunk.
But it’s far too early to make that call about Satoshi Nakamoto’s electronic money. Many bitcoin startups aiming to take the technical innovation underlying the currency mainstream are still getting their products off the ground. And, as erstwhile bitcoin investor Timothy Lee notes , even though people were skeptical of bitcoins selling for $200 each in April 2013, anyone who bought then is still comfortably in the black.
What does seem clear is that bitcoin, as a currency, has yet to provide real competition to the all-mighty dollar.

Falling fuel prices and a rising economy are boosting sales of bigger vehicles, and it's showing in the overall fuel economy average.
The average window-sticker mileage rating for vehicles sold in September was 25.3 mpg, down from the record 25.8 mpg in August, according to a monthly survey by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
The last time fuel economy fell 0.5 mpg was December 2011.
"This large drop likely reflects the increased sales of light trucks and SUVs, and the reduced demand for fuel efficient vehicles of all types because of the falling gas prices," said UMTRI research professor Michael Sivak.
Regardless, it was the eighth straight month that vehicle fuel economy topped 25 mpg and  now is up 5.2 mpg from October 2007, the first full month of monitoring by Sivak and colleague Brandon Schoettle.
The monthly report uses a sales-weighted average of the combined city/highway window-sticker mileage ratings of new vehicles sold during the month.
September sales of new pickups, vans and SUVs, including crossovers, were up 16.6% from a year earlier, in an overall new-vehicle market up 9.4%, according to sales tracker Autodata. They accounted for 53.4% of all new-vehicle sales in Septermber.
The recent month's tally is down 18.7% from August, when more vehicles of all kinds were sold. In August, pickups, vans and SUVs -- collectively referred to as "light trucks" -- were 51.6% of total new-vehicles sales, according to Autodata.
An automaker's vehicles must have a combined city/highway average of 54.5 mpg in laboratory tests in 2025. That will translate to, very roughly, 39 mpg in combined city/highway ratings on window stickers.

Obsession
The Future of Hong Kong
October 6, 2014
Nascent political movements are a little like the Hunger Games. The odds are almost never in the little guys’ favor, which is why we marvel at the fall of the Berlin Wall or the success of Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Last week, Jeff Bader, the Obama administration’s former top adviser on Asia, gave a stark prediction: Hong Kong protestors will almost certainly fail in their demands for universal suffrage. The reality, Bader told the Washington Post , is “Beijing is quite intractable.”
Bader’s assessment is brutal, but fair.
There are, however, pundits who lack Bader’s discernment, and confuse saying “it’s unrealistic” with “it’s absurd.” They sway readers by obfuscating two lines of thinking: Something is difficult to obtain, ergo, it is unworthy of attempt.
Martin Jacques’s piece “ China is Hong Kong’s Future, Not It’s Enemy ” is a classic in this vein. Its logic flows thus:
Hong Kong never had democracy as a British colony
The city has enjoyed more freedoms under Chinese rule than British, and more so than any city on mainland China
To ask for more is unrealistic, overreaching and flat out ungrateful
Writes Jacques: “Although Hong Kong came, over time, to enjoy the rule of law and the right to protest, under the British it never enjoyed even a semblance of democracy. It was ruled from 6,000 miles away in London. The idea of any kind of democracy was first introduced by the Chinese government.”
Let’s put this old saw to bed once and for all. China did not grant Hong Kong these freedoms easily or even willingly. Although Britain was shamefully slow in introducing democracy to Hong Kong—and remains shamefully mute on current proceedings—they were the ones who introduced the first elections in 1980s and greatly expanded them in the 1990s. China fought “tooth and nail” against this, said constitutional scholar and Basic Law expert Danny Gittings , issuing “repeated public warnings to Britain to slow down the introduction of democracy.”
After 1997, some aspects of the expansion of the electoral franchise introduced by Hong Kong’s last governor Chris Patten were rolled back. (Patten’s attempts to inject greater choice into Hong Kong’s system earned him charming sobriquets like “serpent” and “Whore of the East” from Chinese officials.)
People in Hong Kong understandably want a more balanced system now. Currently, special interest groups like the financial and real estate industries have a disproportionate amount of power in electing both Hong Kong’s leader and members of the Legislative Council.
Article 45 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, states: “The ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.”
This was a sop given to Hong Kong’s democrats, who fought hard for this concession. It was something Beijing grudgingly granted, after much wrangling, and was not present in the early drafts of the Basic Law.
At the heart of last week’s street protests are different interpretations of the phrase “broadly representative.” Lawyers can dance on the head of a pin debating this one out, but most reasonable people can understand why Hong Kong protestors might take issue with Beijing’s narrow interpretation: just two or three choices, pre-approved by Chinese authorities.
To understand the Hong Kong protests, we need to separate what’s realistic from what’s right. Clearly, Hong Kong’s protestors have an uphill slog. The possibility of Beijing making significant concessions are almost nil. But it doesn’t make for an intelligent argument to denigrate their goals or aspirations, or portray them as adolescents acting out. There are, of course, quite a lot of young protestors, but so far—though things may of course change—the peaceable, reasoned nature of the protests has been marked by a maturity not seen in Tahrir or Tiananmen.
This Wall Street Journal piece notes “pro-democracy protesters aren’t realists; they’re idealists. Besides, the college students don’t remember British days; high-schoolers weren’t even born then.”
Again with the childish trope, Martin Jacques suggests Hong Kong’s demands are rooted in old-fashioned jealousy. Hong Kong, he says, “got rich because of China,” which fed “an attitude of hubris and arrogance.” Now that the Chinese economy has grown so much, “Hong Kong has lost its role as the gateway to China.”
In his portrayal of the Hong Kong-China relationship, China is clearly the more mature partner, so far tolerant of the city’s sullen, teenage behavior. “The Chinese have persisted with what can best be described as a hands-off approach,” he writes. (Which is hardly true.)
Singapore’s Foreign Affairs minister K. Shanmugam notes Beijing’s proposal is “more than what Hong Kong ever had under the British.”
If these pundits were writing about the women’s suffrage movement, they’d be saying: “Be grateful for shoes, not bound feet. What’s all this fuss about equal pay for equal work?”

BJP in bid to get Rajinikanth on boardUpdated: October 6, 2014 12:09 IST
BJP in bid to get Rajinikanth on board
Sruthisagar Yamunan
The Hindu A senior BJP leader said the party felt the situation as ideal for roping in someone like Rajinikanth, who had mass appeal.
TOPICS
state politics
Sensing a political opportunity in Tamil Nadu following the conviction of AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has intensified its efforts to make superstar Rajinikanth join the party.
During a Navarathri visit to Mr. Rajinikanth’s residence last week, Tamilisai Soundararajan, president of the BJP State unit, tossed the idea of the popular actor supporting the party to his wife, Lata Rajinikanth, party sources said.
BJP sources told The Hindu that Ms. Soundararajan went to the actor’s house on an invitation from Ms. Rajinikanth.
The actor was, however, away shooting for his next movie, Linga.
Ms. Soundararajan invited Mr. Rajinikanth to release a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, currently being given the final touches. She told the family that she would visit again to talk about the book when Mr. Rajinikanth returned. They discussed the political situation.
A senior BJP leader said the party felt the situation as ideal for roping in someone like Mr. Rajinikanth, who had mass appeal.
Past support
Recalling Mr. Rajinikanth’s support to the DMK-TMC combine in 1996, the leader said the actor’s backing could be a huge boost to the party’s fortunes in Tamil Nadu.
“Both the AIADMK and the DMK are facing corruption charges. We believe there will be a huge leadership vacuum in the next Assembly election,” the leader said.
Talk of the BJP trying to get Mr. Rajinikanth on board has been doing the rounds for a while.
The actor has a positive opinion about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who met him at his Poes Garden residence during the Lok Sabha election campaign in the State.
Party national president Amit Shah is learnt to have discussed the possibility of inducting the actor.

World Bank Trims China  East Asia 2014-2016 Growth ForecastsFDI Dips 16 Per Cent to $2.45 Billion in September
Singapore:
The World Bank cut its 2014-2016 growth forecasts for developing East Asia , noting that China was likely to slow due to policies aimed at putting the economy on a more sustainable footing, and it also cautioned of capital-flight risks to Indonesia .
The Washington-based lender expects the developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region to grow 6.9 per cent in 2014 and 2015, down from the 7.1 per cent rate it had previously forecast for both years. Growth in 2013 had been 7.2 per cent.
The bank also trimmed its 2016 growth forecast for the region to 6.8 per cent from 7.1 per cent.
"The main message of this report is one that I would categorise as cautious optimism," World Bank East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Sudhir Shetty said at a media briefing on Monday on the latest East Asia Pacific Economic Update.
Possible risks to the outlook include a weaker-than-expected recovery in global trade and any abrupt rise in global interest rates, the report said, adding that its baseline scenario was based on an orderly normalisation of monetary policy in the United States .
The World Bank said growth in China was likely to slow to 7.4 per cent in 2014 and 7.2 per cent in 2015, down from 7.7 per cent in 2013. Growth in 2016 was seen at 7.1 per cent.
The World Bank had previously seen China 's growth coming in at 7.6 per cent in 2014 and 7.5 per cent in 2015 and 2016.
"Measures to contain local government debt, curb shadow banking, and tackle excess capacity, high energy demand, and high pollution will reduce investment and manufacturing output," it said regarding China 's outlook.
China 's economy has struggled to recover from a soft start to the year when growth slowed to its weakest in 18 months in the first quarter. Beijing has indicated it is prepared to accept slower growth as it tries to wean the world's second-biggest economy away from dependence on investment and exports in favour of consumption.
But a slowdown in the housing market has become an increasing drag on the broader economy, prompting Beijing and local governments to step up efforts to restore momentum.
When asked about the economic implications of the political unrest in Hong Kong, the World Bank 's Shetty said the impact on China 's economy seemed limited at this point.
"What we anticipate is obviously a greater impact on the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region), so slower growth in 2014 than was being anticipated earlier. But at this stage our best estimates...are that there isn't as yet significant spillover to the broader Chinese economy," Shetty told reporters.
HOUSING, CAPITAL FLIGHT RISKS
The report noted potential risks in the region's real estate markets. There was slim evidence of price bubbles in the larger economies, which limited chances of "significant" house price corrections. But, an abrupt financial tightening could trigger a disorderly adjustment of housing prices, the report warned.
On China , the bank said: "A major nationwide correction in real estate prices in China remains unlikely, although there may be pressure on prices in several of the less rapidly growing provinces."
Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific excluding China will slow to 4.8 per cent in 2014 from 5.2 per cent in 2013 due to the slowing economies of Indonesia and Thailand , the World Bank said, adding that growth was likely to rise to 5.3 per cent in 2015.
While the region's vulnerabilities to capital-flow reversals have decreased over the past year, Indonesia remains relatively exposed due to its high short-term external financing needs, it said.
The US Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates at some point next year, with analysts expecting a more aggressive tightening-cycle by the Fed to potentially trigger a destabilising flight of capital from some emerging market economies.
Broad risks to the region include the possibility of slower than expected recovery in global demand, as well as any rapid increase in interest rates, which could lead to debt servicing issues in some EAP countries, particularly among households and corporates, the World Bank said.
Another risk to the region would be a sharp slowdown in China but the likelihood of that is low, partly because Beijing has fiscal buffers to provide economic stimulus, or to bail out banks if non-performing loans emerge, the World Bank said.

New privacy system makes surfing the web saferOct 06, 2014 at 06:16pm IST
New privacy system makes surfing the web safer

London: Researchers have built a new system that protects Internet users' privacy and dramatically improves the safety of surfing the web.
Researchers from University College London, Stanford Engineering, Google, Chalmers University of Technology and Mozilla Research have built the system called 'Confinement with Origin Web Labels,' or COWL.
It works with Mozilla's Firefox and the open-source version of Google's Chrome web browsers and prevents malicious code in a web site from leaking sensitive information to unauthorised parties, while allowing code in a web site to display content drawn from multiple web sites - an essential function for modern, feature-rich web applications.

Testing of COWL prototypes for the Chrome and Firefox web browsers showed the system provides strong security without perceptibly slowing the loading speed of web pages.
Currently, web users' privacy can be compromised by malicious JavaScript code hidden in seemingly legitimate web sites.
The web site's operator may have incorporated code obtained elsewhere into his or her web site without realising that the code contains bugs or is malicious.
Such code can access sensitive data within the same or other browser tabs, allowing unauthorised parties to obtain or modify data without the user's knowledge.
"The new system provides a property known as 'confinement' which has been known since the 1970s, but proven difficult to achieve in practical systems like web browsers," co-author Professor Brad Karp from UCL said.
"COWL confines JavaScript programmes that run within the browser, such as in separate tabs.
"If a JavaScript programme embedded within one web site reads information provided by another web site - legitimately or otherwise - COWL permits the data to be shared, but thereafter restricts the application receiving the information from communicating it to unauthorised parties.
"As a result, the site that shares data maintains control over it, even after sharing the information within the browser," Karp said.

Nifty to remain in 7840-8160 range in short term(The Nifty is expected to…)
By Mitesh Thacker
The Nifty opened on a subdued note last week and recorded highs of 8030. Since then it started trending down and was moving in a narrow range. Eventually, it closed the truncated week at 7945.55 levels, recording a loss of 23.30 points.
Last week the Nifty traded in a sideways range and found resistance from short-term moving averages . An important point to note on the price chart of Nifty is that it is trading in an upward sloping channel after witnessing election result spike.
Wednesday's price action moving averages have witnessed bearish crossover, indicating short-term weakness in the benchmark index.
Traders should note that as far as the Nifty is sustaining above its support trend line of the channel, till then the trend is likely to remain sideways to positive.
If the Nifty witnesses follow up buying and closes above 8050, then we could see it heading towards 8160 / 8220 levels. A move below the lower support would be viewed by traders as a reversal in the upward trend.
The Nifty is expected to remain in the range of 8050 - 8160 on the upside and 7840 on the downside. It holds an important support at 7840 levels.
Cautious is advised below 7840 levels. If the Nifty closes below 7840, then it can further decline up to the lows of 7745 / 7590 levels.
In a nutshell, the market is trading in a crucial support zone. This week's move is important as it would be an intermediate trend decider for the Nifty.

Shelling exposes Pakistan's frustration: Omar Abdullah

Post your opinion here
 
Condemning the shelling on civilians in Arnia belt of Jammu that left five dead, J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah Monday said that the targeting of civilian areas exposed the frustration of the Pakistani government after its failure to gain international attention on the Kashmir issue.
"They (the Pakistani leadership) have nothing else to speak, but only Kashmir. Whenever they go abroad, they try to raise only Kashmir issue, but every time they miserably fail to get international attention. The cross-border shelling is an indication of their frustration," he told reporters after meeting civilians injured in the shelling at the Government Medical College Hospital here.
Omar strongly condemned the firing and said, "Either we are unable to understand Pakistan’s motive behind the increase in the incidents of ceasefire violations or the internal situation in Pakistan is so bad that by targeting Indian side they want to divert the attention of their own people from their internal turmoil."
The Chief Minister said that at a time when people of Jammu and Kashmir should be getting Eid greetings from the Pakistan side, the Pakistani army has gifted them with bombs.
"There was no reason to violate the ceasefire. It was a deliberate attempt from the Pakistani side to target the civilian areas. The death and injury to so many innocent civilians is a part of their nefarious designs," he said.
Omar said that so far he has not spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but if need arises he will brief him about the situation in the state following the frequent ceasefire violations.
Asked about the rehabilitation of the people affected by the cross-border firing, he said, "We have taken up the issue with the Centre. Our financial condition does not allow us to carry out the rehabilitation of our people. We want help from the Centre. The Centre must come forward to help the people of Kashmir."
Omar announced that the family members of the people who lost their lives will get ex-gratia payment and government jobs.
"The ex-gratia cheques have been signed and will be issued soon. The next of the kin of the deceased would also be given government jobs as per the rule applicable under death in harness cases," the Chief Minister said.
Earlier, after offering Eid prayers at Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar, Omar went to the state hospital in the city where he donated blood.
He later flew to Jammu, the winter capital of the state, to meet injured people who were undergoing treatment in various hospitals.
Meanwhile, BSF Director General D K Pathak has also left for Jammu from Delhi to take stock of the developing security situation in the area.
Five villagers were killed and 29 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district in one of the worst ceasefire violations.

Patna stampede: BJP for slapping murder case against officials  govt says no27
1
Patna: BJP on Monday demanded slapping of murder case against the transferred civil and police officers following the October 3 stampede that claimed 33 lives, while the Bihar government said the main opposition party was trying to politicising the incident.
"Mere transfer is no punishment for these officials whose negligence resulted in the death of 33 persons and injuries to 29 others. It is a clear cut case of murder, hence a case should be filed against them," senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said at a protest dharna.
Patna Divisional Commissioner N Vijaylaxmi, DIG, Patna Range Ajitabh Kumar, Patna District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma and Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj were removed on Sunday, two days after the stampede. Water Resources Department Minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, however, said the demand for slapping murder charge against the officials reflected duplicity of the BJP.
"Mere transfer is no punishment for these officials whose negligence resulted in the death of 33 persons and injuries to 29 others," BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said.
#bjp #bihar government #sushil kumar modi #patna stampede
When in power, the BJP had not made such a demand two years ago when 18 devotees were killed in a stampede during Chhath festival at Adalat Ghat, Chaudhary said. "Both the incidents are identical, but the BJP has conveniently changed its tack to suit its new role in opposition," the minister said.
"By staging dharna and expression dissatisfaction with the transfer of four senior civil and police officials, the BJP is only bent on politicising the incident," he said. Sushil Modi, who was deputy chief minister in the previous NDA government, attacked Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, saying, "The officials were found partying in a posh hotel, and the CM went to his native place in Gaya to celebrate Dusshera while people were dying in Patna."
Stating that the state government was saddened with the loss of lives in the stampede and shared the sorrow with the affected family members, Chaudhary said it has taken all measures, including transfer of top four Patna district officials and carried out rescue and relief works.
Modi, however, described as 'eyewash' the probe by Principal Secretary (home) Amir Subhani and Additional Director General of Police (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey ordered by the state government and instead demanded an inquiry by an all party team into the stampede.
Instead of dubbing the steps taken by the state government as 'eyewash', the minister said, the opposition should have hailed the transfer of four officials as their absence would expedite the probe process. On Modi's demand for removal of the Home Secretary, he said it was Modi himself who had praised the Home Secretary for his dedication to work.

Throw out dynastic politics  Modi tells voters in Haryanastate politics
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday invoked the Congress’s biggest icons, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, while hitting out at the Congress for neglecting Nehru’s legacy.
Campaigning for the Haryana Assembly election in Hisar on Monday, Mr. Modi said: “Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister, was Chacha Nehru to children and I would like that on November 14, his birth anniversary, children of all schools be given lessons in cleanliness and hygiene.”
The cleanliness campaign should continue till the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on November 19, he said and urged all schools and anganwadis to participate. “Those who want to pay tribute to Chacha Nehru should sit with the children he loved so much and tell them how to lead a healthier life.”
The Prime Minister, who also addressed rallies at Kurukshetra and Faridabad, attacked the Haryana government for allegedly clearing a controversial land deal involving Robert Vadra and targeted Indian National Lok Dal leader Om Prakash Chautala.
“There is a baba who got his photo clicked with me at a public function. He is going around with this photo, saying that he will offer us support after elections. Forgive me baba, I have the support of 125 crore Indians. I don’t need the support of people from Tihar,” said Mr. Modi in an apparent reference to Mr. Chautala who has been convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail in a teachers’ recruitment scam case.
Mr. Modi urged the Election Commission to take note of the recent approval of the land deal in favour of Mr. Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

Investors still exuberant  but Modi needs to deliver  says Jim RogersBrent crude oil
("Many global investors…)
Many global investors are still somewhat exuberant about India's prospects after Narendra Modi became the prime minister, but some of them are beginning to worry in the absence of results, said legendary maverick investor Jim Rogers.
In an interview with ET, Singapore-based Rogers, who co-founded Quantum Fund with another celebrity investor George Soros in the 1960s, got candid when he said he is buying India's stock index while staying away from gold for a while. Excerpts:
How do you rate the performance of the new government under Narendra Modi?
So far, Modi does not seem to have produced results, which we all expected him to do. He said a lot of wonderful things, but so far nothing has happened, other than a lot of public relations.
Do foreign portfolio investors share your view? What is the mood among these investors because their inflows have slowed in the last two months?
The mood about India is still somewhat exuberant because Modi is still very popular since the last elections. But some people have begun to worry about how long this honeymoon period will go on.
Modi has not done much to change the economic outlook of India. People are waiting to see when Modi is going to change its economic policy, or start opening up of India to outside world. The expectations are very high because Modi at some point of time has to come up with some concrete proper actions.
What will be the impact of interest rate hikes by the US Fed next year on markets?
Most central banks follow the market, and the market dictates what has to happen. In the US, interest rates have already started going up a bit, and they will continue to go higher, in my view. The US central bank will be forced to cut back its bond purchases and probably they will, and that will lead to higher interest rates.
At some point, we are going to have interest rates that will affect markets though that may not happen for a while. But when it happens, central banks will panic, the US central bank will panic and then they all will again start buying bonds in order to calm down the markets. Then again, interest rates will come down for while, and there will be bubble in the markets.
How do you see emerging markets like India getting impacted from the US Federal Reserve interest rate hike?
Emerging markets will get impacted from the US Federal Reserve interest rate hike. Last year, it scared lot of people, including the best of the emerging markets, when the tapering of quantitative easing was announced. When the market goes down by a fair amount, central banks will panic, and they will say "Don't worry, we will help you". Yes, it's going to affect everybody, especially the emerging markets.
 
You have been a big Gold Bull for a while. What is your view on it (gold prices have tumbled to its lowest level in 15 months to below $1,200/ounce)?
I have not been buying gold for a long time. I hope that I may get another chance to buy gold some time this year or next. If gold prices drop below $1,000/ounce, I hope to buy a lot more gold. Meanwhile, I have not bought nor sold gold though I have hedged some of my gold.
So, what are you buying these days?
I am buying stock index in India, stock index in Russia. I am long on fertilisers and agriculture commodities as I expect prices to go up. I am overweight on the US dollar. I am overweight on Japanese blue chips as pension funds there are adjusting their portfolios. I am overweight on China as the government is emphasising its economic plans for the next 20-years.
Why are you buying US dollars now? Are you betting on the US economic recovery?
The US dollar is partially gaining strength because there is turmoil in the markets; people are worried about the Middle East, Russia, and when people are worried, they quickly resort to the US dollar to make payments. The US dollar is not safe haven anymore, but people don't understand that. As long as there is turmoil in the world, the dollar will go higher and higher, and this will hurt many countries and economies. And my plan is when the dollar goes higher and higher, I will sell the dollars. Having said that, currently I am long on dollars.
Do you think Brent crude oil will fall further from the current levels (it has fallen over 20% since June this year to hit a 27-month low)?
We are going to have a bit more correction in crude oil prices and some commodities. I hope to buy some commodities when this correction goes far enough. The world is running out of oil in most countries, and the bull market in crude oil is still not over in my view. When crude oil goes down further, I would rather buy the commodity than sell.
Some of the emerging economies, including India, are showing signs of recovery. Is it sustainable?
Well, that has been true for most part of the world because vast amount of money has been pumped into Japan, America, Europe, and the UK. Whether the recovery will last or not I don't know. But these are all artificial money which has been pumped in to rest of the world.

Marked up prices  crashing server spoil Flipkart party‘Marked up’ prices, server crash spoil Flipkart party
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 06, 2014

The great deals and discounts that e-commerce majors such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and others are announcing in full-page advertisements every day this festive season may not all be for real.
India’s biggest e-commmerce company, Flipkart, in particular earned the ire of disgruntled shoppers by offering some supposedly discounted items at prices higher than what rivals such as Amazon and Snapdeal were offering.
For instance, a MacBookAir 13” was priced at Rs. 56,490 on Flipkart but Snapdeal sold it for Rs. 49,999.
In other instances, the company allegedly marked up the retail prices of some products and then offered “discounts” that brought the selling prices close to market rates.
“But the digital customer is smart. With so many social sites, it will be difficult to pull a wool over their eyes. They will see through any such attempt,” said Sandeep Komaravelly, senior VP (marketing) at rival Snapdeal.com.
To be fair, this practice of ramping up prices and then offering a “discount” was not true for all products, since a few discounts were genuine and lapped up by the customers.
Flipkart’s big festive season sale, The Big Billion Day, overburdened its servers, which crashed within two hours of the sale opening, angering shoppers further. “The traffic was heavy but our server did not crash,” a Flipkart spokesperson said, but refused to give any details.
Shoppers took to Twitter, Facebook and blogging to attack the company’s pricing.
A Twitter user, @Surnell, posted screenshots of what purported to show Flipkart raising prices of a product in the run-up to the sale only to slap a discount on Monday.

— Suresh En (@surnell) October 6, 2014
“We got a billion hits on our site today and achieved our 24 hour sales target of $100 million (Rs 600 crore) in gross merchandise value (industry lingo for sales) in just 10 hours.
We are truly humbled by the immense faith our customers have shown in us,” Flipkart’s promoters Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said in a statement on Monday evening.
Underlining the fierce battle for customers among e-commerce companies, Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, bought the domain name “bigbillionday.com” (Flipkart’s name for its sale), which redirects customers to amazon.com and trolls Flipkart.
Monday’s sale brought hordes of shoppers not only to Flipkart but to other retailers as well. “We have seen a 30% jump today and over the last week, the traffic has been 10% higher than what we get very month,” Snapdeal’s Komaravelly.
Amazon spokesperson said, “Today, on the last day of our ‘Mission to Mars’ campaign, we have witnessed a 100% increase in sales since yesterday.
It is our biggest day ever and we believe it is owed to the introduction of Dhamaka deals every hour through the day  and ensuring the availability of the deals advertised.”
Amazon will hold week three of the “Online Shopping Dhamaka” festive celebrations followed by the “Diwali Dhamaka Week” starting October 10.

A nervous and anxious AIADMK awaits Jayalalithaa’s bail plea hearing in Karnataka high court on Tuesday. On the eve of the hearing on Monday, party workers held protests and prayers across the state. Barring minor incidents, the protests were mostly peaceful.
Frontal organisations of the AIADMK have been mobilizing support for Amma’s release. On Tuesday, farmers across the state would also come out in support, an AIADMK functionary said.
The cadres are tense as they fear that a delay in securing bail may result in increased attacks on the government. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has already demanded the dismissal of TN government and imposition of President’s rule in the state.
“It is an anti-democratic demand to subvert a democratically-elected government,” said AIADMK office bearer, Avadi Kumar. “AIADMK protests are not causing any inconvenience to the people,” he added.
The opposition DMK and DMDK are slowly but surely coming out against the protests and are questioning how the protests were allowed without permission. DMDK chief Captain Vijayakanth questioned why Section 144 was not imposed in the state to check the protests.
Private schools and colleges had declared a bandh for Tuesday in support of Jayalalithaa but beat a hasty retreat when it was challenged in the Madras high court.
 
Private bus operators have decided to stop plying buses to Bengaluru and said they would stop the services at Hosur bordering Bengaluru.
The Bengaluru central jail at Parappanna Agrahara is about 40 km from Hosur.

Pakistan continues to violate ceasefire  kills 5 civiliansPakistan continues to violate ceasefire, kills 5 civilians

The Indian government hardened its stance and asked the Border Security Force (BSF) to “retaliate with full force” after five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in firing by Pakistani forces along the border in Jammu on Monday, official sources said.
 
Tensions flared after four Pakistani civilians, including two children and a woman, were killed in retaliatory firing by India as home minister Rajnath Singh and defence minister Arun Jaitley warned Pakistan to stop such attacks if it wanted peace talks with India.
 
“Ceasefire violation must stop. Pakistan must realise that a decisive government has come to power, which will not take such instances lying down,” Singh told HT in an interview.

India and Pakistan exchanged fire in Arnia and RS Pura sectors late on Monday, the heaviest firing between the two countries since India called off bilateral talks last month. Jaitley said the repeated ceasefire violations would not help normalise relations between the two countries and Indian armed forces were responding to all provocations from across the border.
 
"This is resulting in a series of ceasefire violations as a result of which innocent civilians have lost their lives. Pakistan must realise that the kind of environment it is generating between the two countries is certainly not going to help in normalising relations. The onus of creating a positive environment is on Pakistan which is utterly failing to do so," Jaitley said.

A senior government official told HT on condition of anonymity that border agencies, mainly the BSF and the army, had received instructions to not just match mortar for mortar but “outnumber the number of mortars in retaliation”.
 
“There is no hesitation to our response now. If Pakistan fires five mortars, we can retaliate with 10,” he said.
 
The violence puts more strain on already-tense ties between India and Pakistan after New Delhi called off planned foreign secretary-level talks following the Pakistani ambassador’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders last month.
 
Worst affected by the Pakistani firing in India was Mashain-de-kothe village, where four members of a family were killed. Mortars also landed at Arnia town, about three km from the International Border (IB), forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.
 
“When firing started we thought it would be another routine thing. But when heavy mortars started pounding our homes and heard cries, it was our worst nightmare,” said Soma Devi, a relative of the family that lost four members to the firing.
 
BSF sources said India will not have a flag meeting after the firing which began late last Thursday in a bid to disrupt Dussehra celebrations. Media reports said three militants were killed as the army foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Tangdhar sector.
 
The Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning what it described as India’s “unprovoked firing”.
 
“The government of Pakistan has lodged a strong protest with the government of India through diplomatic channels and called for restraining its forces from constant violation of the ceasefire," it said in the statement.
 
With tension prevailing on the border, the traditional exchange of sweets between Indian and Pakistani troops at the Attari border in Punjab on Eid was called off. However, sweets were exchanged at Chakan-da-bagh area in Poonch.

award and prize
U.S.-British scientist John O’Keefe and Norwegian married couple May—Britt Moser and Edvard Moser won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discovering the brain’s positioning system.
This “inner GPS” helps explain how the brain creates “a map of the space surrounding us and how we can navigate our way through a complex environment,” the Nobel Assembly said.
O’Keefe, of University College London, discovered the first component of this positioning system in 1971 when he found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room.
Thirty--four years later May-Britt and Edvard Moser, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, identified another type of nerve cell that generates a coordinate system for precise path—finding, the assembly said.
It said that knowledge about the brain’s positioning system may “help us understand the mechamism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss” that affects people with Alzheimer’s disease.
The Nobel awards in physics, chemistry, literature and peace will be announced later this week. The economics prize will be announced next Monday.

Modi dividend may push economic growth up  says World BankCare Ratings
(The World Bank calls for…)
NEW DELHI: A 'Modi dividend' could lift India's economic growth to 6.4% in 2015-16, the World Bank has said, referring to a possible boost to the animal spirits of entrepreneurs due to the coming to power in May of a government perceived to be more market-friendly than the previous one.
"The Indian economy , 80% of the (South Asia) region's output, is set to grow by 6.4% in 2015-16 after 5.6% in 2014-15...India is benefiting from a 'Modi dividend'," noted the World Bank's bi-annual report, South Asia Economic Focus. Apart from the rather unusual personalisation of the sources of India's economic growth, the report is otherwise along conventional lines.
China's Growth Will Slow to 7.2%
The World Bank calls for structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic management for a better medium-term outcome. "The Modi effect is definitely playing out as far as capital inflows are concerned. Inflation needs to trend downwards, but the external and fiscal positions look very promising," said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at SBI.
He added that the current year's growth could turn out to be higher than the 5.6% estimated by the World Bank. As far as India's giant neighbour is concerned, the World Bank has estimated that China's growth will slow to 7.2% next year, a cut from the 7.5% estimated in April this year. The bank also does not see any threat for India because of the likely withdrawal of US monetary stimulus over the rest of 2014 and 2015, as the economy is now stronger in terms of its ability to manage current account.
India's economic growth will accelerate to touch the 7% mark in 2016-17, according to the report, which took note of recent policy measures undertaken. These include liberalisation of foreign direct investment in railways and defence, disbanding of the Planning Commission and its replacement by an economic advisory body, financial inclusion as well as actions to simplify land acquisition and reform labour laws.
India's economy turned around sharply in the first quarter of 2014-15 to grow at 5.8%, bucking the dismal sub-5% growth of the last two years. "India's growth performance remains strong vis-a-vis emerging market peers," the World Bank said. Private investment is expected to pick up thanks to the new government's business orientation and declining oil prices should boost private sector competitiveness, it added. "The 'Modi Dividend' is coming out from the positive sentiment, as reflected in the stock market .
All economic indicators look positive, aided by the base effect and actual recovery in some areas. But there is a lot of resolution shown by the government in areas like fiscal deficit and current account deficit. We expect economy to see an all round recovery soon," said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings .

Recruiters foresee boom in demand for talent...Ajit Isaac
(The real recruitment spree…)
MUMBAI: Boom times back in the job market? Recruiters think so. Hiring data for the July-September quarter shows a two-year high and more than half a dozen recruiters reckon levels last seen during the 2007 boom will return in the next few months. The real recruitment spree will come when employers focus on talent for new jobs. Right now, the hiring is brisk thanks mostly to vacant positions being filled.
Top-Level hiring to be up after lag
For Bangalore-based Ikya Human Capital Solutions , the July-September period topped recruitment closures of the last seven years. "We closed around 4,000 positions in all, including 3,000 in temporary staffing. This is more than any quarter till seven years ago," said Ajit Isaac , chairman and MD of the recruitment firm that looks after middle order and temporary hiring. "There is a demand for managing directors in automotive, manufacturing and infrastructure projects," said R Suresh, managing director of RGF Executive Search.
The Japan-headquartered company also touched a 13-month high in its India numbers and closures were significantly higher than same period last year." Another recruitment company that looks mainly at IT middle management hiring said the two-year high includes counter-offers. "This is also good news because it shows mobility in markets and that candidates are willing to look at changes," said the company head, who refused to be named. Also clocking in its best quarter in a couple of years was Bangalore-based The Head Hunters.
Mandates for this recruitment company come from ecommerce, engineering and consumer sectors, according to Kris Lakshmikanth , chief executive of The Head Hunters (India). This September, the recruitment firm hired four senior members for a Canadian company that has operations in Chennai; the posts had been vacant for a while. Staffing companies like Randstad India as well have touched their two-year best this September. "Action from the new government is yet to be seen on ground but we expect larger orders to come in," said Aditya Narayan Mishra, president (staffing) at Randstad India. TeamLease clocked in its highest number of closures in 18 months.
"The number of openings per client has gone up. Earlier, if they wanted one person for the post of a bank manager, they are asking for five now," said co-founder and senior vice-president Rituparna Chakraborty . Brisk hiring will, however, not be in conjunction with any drastic changes in salary structures. Increment levels will be around 15-40% when changing jobs and compensation packages will see more long-term incentives. Hiring for top level talent is also expected to pick up - but after a lag.

Subdued opening likely, Infosys in focus as Q2 earnings season begins

(FIIs have invested about…)
MUMBAI: Dalal Street is set to open on a quiet note on Tuesday after a prolonged weekend. But, activity will pick up into this weekend as traders and investors start building positions to bet on September quarter results. Infosys will flag off the earnings season for big companies on Friday. Bullish traders are hoping that the Nifty stays above 7850, a crucial support below which the market could correct sharply.
Since Thursday, Nifty futures on Singapore Exchange , which has been closely tracked by die-hard market participants because of the holidays in India, has dipped below 7850 once but has managed to bounce above this level. On Monday, Singapore Nifty futures closed at 7926. Nifty on the NSE had closed at 7945 on Wednesday. "We don't expect much downside to the markets. Action will pick up towards end of the week with the earnings season kicking in," said Kunj Bansal, ED & chief investment officer at Centrum .
A big worry for investors in India has been the slowdown in foreign portfolio inflows. FIIs have invested about $845 million in September, which is the lowest monthly flow since February this year, when they pumped in $228 million. In the past two months, average inflows were about $865 million, which is about one-third of its five-month (March-July) average flows of $2.3 billion.
The slowing FII inflows resulted in the Sensex ending its seven-month winning streak, with the index losing 0.1% in September, ending its longest run of monthly gains since January 2007. "The continuous selling pressure from FIIs has kept NSE Nifty below 8050 levels. We expect Nifty to continue its consolidation phase, while maintaining its key support at 7850," said Ahmad Azeem , chief manager, at ICICI Securities . Continued inflows into domestic mutual funds from retail investors, however, have halted a sharp selloff.
But most of this money is flowing into mid- and small-cap funds. Options traders seem to be betting on the Nifty finding support at 7800. Put option of strike 7800 has seen the highest open interest . "We expect markets to consolidate and move sideways this week in absence of fresh triggers. Traders are expected to stay light in derivatives segment with only 12-trading sessions left before Diwali holidays," said Chandan Taparia , derivatives and technical analyst at Anand Rathi Securities.

Asian Shares Edge Up, Dollar Steadies After Drop

Gold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
Tokyo:
Asian shares tentatively rose in early trade on Tuesday, while the dollar steadied after investors locked in some gains overnight on its recent rally.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 per cent in early trade, shrugging off a choppy, losing session on Wall Street overnight.
Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped 0.3 per cent ahead of the outcome of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting later in the session.
The BOJ is widely expected to maintain its massive monetary stimulus programme and offer a bleaker view on factory output, after signs Japan's economy was hit harder than expected by a national sales tax increase in April.
"We expect the BOJ to keep monetary policy on hold, but it could lower its economic assessment to reflect continuing data weakness" since the tax hike, strategists at Barclays said in a note to clients.
Against the yen, the dollar edged up about 0.1 per cent to 108.91 yen, pulling away from an overnight low of 108.65 but still well shy of a six-year peak of 110.09 yen marked last week.
The euro inched down 0.1 per cent on the day to $1.2645 but held well above a more than two-year low of $1.2501 set on Friday, after the US non-farm payrolls report fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates by mid-2015.
Investors had a muted reaction to Monday's disappointing report on German industrial orders, which fell 5.7 per cent in August to mark their biggest monthly drop since 2009.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, slipped 0.2 per cent to 85.795 after marking its biggest one-day fall since July 2013. The index rose to a four-year high of 86.746 on Friday, and logged a record 12 straight weeks of gains in which it rose about 7.7 per cent.
The Australian dollar added about 0.1 per cent to $0.8766, pulling away from Friday's low of $0.8642 which was its lowest level since July 2010.
Investors will be watching to see if the Reserve Bank of Australia tries to talk its currency even lower at its regular policy review on Tuesday, at which it is widely expected to hold its cash rate steady at 2.5 per cent. The RBA will announce its decision at 0330 GMT.
The dollar's overnight weakness helped put a floor under recently slumping crude prices. Brent was steady on the day at $92.78 a barrel.
Gold also steadied at $1,205.90 an ounce. In a volatile session on Monday, it marked its biggest one-day gain in two months, after first bumping to a 15-month low.

(Analysts said many traders…)
MUMBAI: Savvy traders have placed bullish bets on Infosys ahead of its second quarter earnings due on Friday, October 10. Brokers and analysts said the long positions in Infosys futures and options contracts have been created on hopes that the software exporter's new chief executive officer Vishal Sikka may announce a road map for its future growth.
"Traders can expect 3-4% upside in Infosys stock price on the results day. Most of the positions in the futures segment are long in nature. Bears have gone into hiding from the stock," said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICI Direct. Infy futures open interest, or outstanding positions, at the beginning of the October series is currently around 33 lakh shares, compared to about 25 lakh shares at the beginning of the September series.
Analysts said many traders have squared off their short positions ahead of the results. Infosys saw a strong open interest build-up on the long side last week. The stock has also given a major breakout on the weekly charts above Rs 3,680, said Ashish Chaturmohta, head of technical and derivatives desk at Fortune Equity Broking. Infosys shares closed at Rs 3,847.20 on Wednesday.
Chaturmohta expects the stock to rise another 7-8% in the near term. In Infy call options, the highest open interest is at 4,000 strike in the October series. Analysts said the build-up suggests traders expect stock to rise to Rs 4,000.
"We expect the Infosys stock to move substantially higher in the October series. The open interest in out-of-the-money (OTM) call option (the strike price that is higher than the market price) has been increasing, which is a strong bullish indicator," said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas.
Recently, CLSA has upgraded Infosys rating to 'Buy' from 'Outperform', and has increased its price target to Rs 4,500 from Rs 3,750. Infosys shares have rallied nearly 20% in the last three months, and have outperformed the BSE IT Index, which has gained 17.5%.
The broader benchmark Sensex has gained 4% during the same period. Amar Ambani, head of research at IIFL, said, "IT companies are expected to report strong quarterly performance driven by seasonal project ramp-ups, and currency tailwinds. There is also a high likelihood of incrementally encouraging commentary by most companies on revenue visibility given US growth acceleration."

Breaking up is the latest Wall St. crazeBy Paul R. La Monica   @lamonicabuzz October 6, 2014: 11:51 AM ET
 
Corporate divorces are all the rage
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
They may not be as juicy as celebrity breakups, but corporate divorces are all the rage these days.
Hewlett-Packard's decision to split into two companies is just the latest in a series of corporate breakups.
Ironically enough, the last company that HP ( HPQ , Tech30 ) CEO Meg Whitman led, eBay ( EBAY , Tech30 ), disclosed plans last week to spin off PayPal -- which was bought under Whitman's watch in 2002.
Considering that HP's stock was up more than 4% Monday on the news and eBay surged 7.5% the day it announced its split, expect more spinoffs. Big companies live and die by the "me too" copycat strategy.
If the stock market were a washing machine, we're definitely in the middle of a "spin cycle" right now.
Joe Cornell, publisher of Spin-Off Research, a firm that tracks corporate splits, said that this is shaping up to be the biggest year for spin-offs since 2000. And it's not just technology companies that are selling off pieces of themselves either.
The biggest spin-off this year was GE's ( GE ) initial public offering for its credit card unit Synchrony Financial ( SYF ).
Related: Baby GEs? General Electric may need a breakup
CNNMoney owner Time Warner ( TWX ) spun off its publishing unit Time Inc. ( TIME ) a few months ago. And another media company, USA Today publisher Gannett ( GCI ), plans to separate its newspapers from its TV station business.
Several well-known consumer companies have announced breakups or are in the process of doing so. Struggling retailer Sears ( SHLD ) spun off Lands' End ( LE ) -- and Lands' End has thrived since being set free from Sears.
Kleenex maker Kimberly-Clark ( KMB ), Hertz ( HTZ ), Barnes & Noble ( BKS ) and Energizer ( ENR ) are also planning to spin off units.
So who could be next to split? Cornell thinks energy companies Apache ( APA ) and Babcock & Wilcox ( BWC ) could be candidates for a breakup. Babcock & Wilcox has already said it is considering a split and both it and Apache are facing pressure from activist hedge funds to boost returns.
Cornell added that more telecoms could follow the lead of Windstream ( WIN ) and spin off landline units into real estate investment trusts to take advantage of favorable tax treatments for REITs. He suggested that smaller regional telecoms CenturyLink ( CTL ) and Frontier ( FTR ) could do a REIT conversion and that even Verizon ( VZ , Tech30 ) might want to consider it.
Whether or not breakups work for any of these individual companies remains to be seen. But it does appear that the companies that are spun off are good bets.
The Guggenheim Spin-off ETF ( CSD ), which tracks an index of spin-offs, has outperformed the S&P 500 since it began trading in 2006.
Two of the top holdings in the fund are Zoetis ( ZTS ), the veterinary medicine unit that used to be owned by drug giant Pfizer ( PFE ), and soy milk producer WhiteWave ( WWAV ), a spin-off of Dean Foods ( DF ).
"Investors prefer more focused, nimble companies," Cornell said.

Police book two dozen people for raising anti-India slogans in J&KPrint
Express News Service | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:08 pm
The Jammu and Kashmir police on Monday booked nearly two dozen people for raising anti-India slogans at Kishtwar.
Two of the people have been arrested, sources said, identifying them as Saqib Shah resident of Puhie and Muddasir of Baghwan area.
Giving details, sources said that trouble erupted in the town soon after the Eid prayers at Chowghan Maidan when some local Muslim youth tried to take out a procession. Some of the processionists raised anti-India and pro-ISISI slogans.
As provocative slogans had led to communal tension in the town leading to wide spread violence and arson on Eid last year, the police immediately swung into action and registered a case. While two people have been arrested, more are likely as police are looking for others raising provocative slogans during Eid procession.

Apple did not choose GT Advanced Technologies to provide special durable glass for the iPhone 6. (Photo: Getty)
GT Advanced Technologies (GTAT) , the company jilted by Apple (AAPL) in bringing hardened “sapphire” glass to iPhones, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday.
Shares of the company dropped $10.13, or 92%, to 92 cents a share.
Investors widely speculated GT Advanced would be providing special durable glass for the iPhone 6. But after the announcement of the new phone, investors were stunned that GT’s material was noticeably left out. Shares of GT Advanced lost more than a third of their value since the Apple announcement. Apple decided to use hardened glass from GT Advanced rival Corning instead.
GT Advanced reported revenue of $58 million during the quarter ending June 2014, down 65% from the same period a year ago. The company lost $86.4 million during the June quarter.
The downfall of GT Advanced underscores the risky proposition of relying too much on a big, powerful company like Apple. GT was already in a difficult financial condition, but its only savior was the contract with Apple, says Nicholas Yee, analyst at stock research firm Gradient Analytics. “Bookings and backlog were all trending highly negative, company had massive inventory issues,” Yee says.
Yee says Apple had been planning to use GT’s so-called sapphire glass in the iPhone 6. But manufacturing issues were a problem and prompted Apple to choose another glass vendor.
Investors had plenty of warning of the company’s troubles, if they knew where to look, Yee says. Officers and directors have been selling the stock, even before the negative announcements. “A big red flag has always been the insider selling with this name,” Yee says.
“I found it highly nefarious that management continued to sell at highs for the stock around $18-$20,” Yee says. “Specifically, the CEO sold about 75% of his total share amount from the end of last year until this summer when the stock was still at highs.”

October may see large swings or a big one-way trend developOctober may see large swings or a big one-way trend develop

The market has several major events to weigh and discount in the short-term. The RBI's policy review held both rates and liquidity. But the dollar and the euro will see policy changes in the near-term. The dollar is hardening on the basis of the Fed ending its QE3 this month. The euro is all set to soften if the European Central Bank starts loosening up as Mario Draghi has promised.
On the domestic front, the flow of Q2 corporate results is expected to start, along with macro-economic data like the Index of Industrial Production. The global sentiment was bearish through last week but there was a recovery on last Friday and Monday on the basis of good US employment data. India was shut but it is quite possible that the market will open high today due to this.
However, there is an anticipation that FII flows could slow or reverse in the short-term. The advances-declines ratios are negative. FIIs have been sellers in the past few sessions and domestic institutions have been very moderate buyers.
If the dollar does harden, pharmaceuticals and information technology are the two obvious areas where there would be a bullish effect. IT is more likely to be backed in the very short-term, given that Infosys will, as usual, kick off Q2 results. If Infosys does well, the entire industry could see an uptrend. In the forex market itself, a long dollar-rupee and a short euro-rupee both look reasonable.
In the meantime, option premiums remain high and the Vix has risen. There is definitely a fear-factor in the market. The Nifty has tested successive supports below 8,000. The latest bounce was from the 7,850 level. If that support breaks, the index could slide till 7,775 or 7,700, going by Fibonacci-based retracement calculations. Dips below 7,700 could mean initiation of a strong intermediate downtrend.
If the support at 7,850 holds, the upside is limited, until and unless the Nifty beats resistance between 8,125 and 8,175 and heads towards new highs. Even if there is a rise on Tuesday, it is unlikely to be sustainable unless the Nifty can clear 8,175 inside a couple of sessions.
The Bank Nifty is a big question-mark. If FII selling continues, it could hit the private banks. However, the Bank Nifty could hold at support within the 15,200-15,300 range. On the upside, a climb till 15,600 is possible. The financial index would hit massive resistances above 15,600.
The Nifty's Put-Call ratios look bearish. The Nifty's put-call ratio is at 0.99 for the three-month set and it's just above 1 for the October series. The Nifty Call chain has massive open interest (OI) at October 8200c, which is the likely upper limit on a bounce. The Put chain has a lot of OI down till 7,500.
The spot Nifty index closed at 7,945 with the futures at 7,982.15 on Wednesday. Given the high VIX and the fact that it's early in the settlement, the option trader could look at far-from money options. There is a good chance that October will see large swings or a big one-way trend developing. While it may seem tempting, it would be dangerous to sell options for that reason.
A far-from money bullspread of long Oct 8,100c (57) and short 8,200c (29) costs 28 and pays a maximum of 72. A FFM bearspread of long Oct 7,900p (77) and short 7,800p (49) also costs 28 and has a maximum payoff of 72. Combining these two contracts, gives a negative risk:return ratio, with a cost of 56 and max payoff of 44.

Yahoo eying Snapchat after Alibaba windfallYahoo eyeing Snapchat after Alibaba windfall

What is Snapchat?
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Seeking to replicate the success of its investment in Alibaba, Yahoo ( YHOO , Tech30 ) is reportedly setting its sights on Snapchat.
The internet giant is in talks to sink $20 million into the photo messaging startup in a deal that would value Snapchat at $10 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Related: What is Snapchat?
The move would mark Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's latest attempt to keep shareholders happy while she works to revitalize the company.
Yahoo's bet on Alibaba ( BABA , Tech30 ) paid off big. It provided a massive windfall of around $5 billion (after taxes) from the Chinese conglomerate's IPO, which was the largest in history. It also gave Yahoo much needed buzz and momentum. Yahoo's stock has soared 20% in the past six months, often jumping whenever Alibaba's IPO was in the news.
Related: China is the real winner from Alibaba IPO
While Mayer has already indicated that she would return at least half of the proceeds from the Alibaba IPO to shareholders, presumably in the form of a stock buyback, analysts have been watching closely to see what she plans to do with the rest of the cash.
As CNNMoney's Paul La Monica wrote last month, it's "put up or shut up time " for Mayer and Yahoo.
The investment in Snapchat, although less than 1% of the Alibaba windfall, is the first big move.
There are already questions about whether it even makes sense. Snapchat is no Alibaba.
The app, though wildly popular amongst younger users, doesn't advertise and therefore brings in no revenue . Its technology isn't necessarily hard to replicate. And since messages sent through the app only exist temporarily, it can't mine the communications of users for marketing insights the way other social networks do (that is if it keeps its promise to regulators ).
Related: Yahoo wins battle in secretive surveillance court
Alibaba, by contrast, booked a profit of nearly $2 billion in the second quarter and is predicted to grow rapidly along with the Chinese middle class.
But Mayer is under pressure to prove that Yahoo's turnaround is the real thing. She's made a string of acquisitions in recent years, including the purchase of blogging site Tumblr and Summly, the news aggregation site created by a British teenager. There's even rumors that Yahoo could buy AOL, a move supported by at least one prominent investor.
She's also made a big effort to focus more on mobile, social, and video.
Interestingly, Yahoo also bought messaging app MessageMe late last week and then immediately shut it down. That strategy begs the question of whether Yahoo has its own plans in the mobile messaging space.
Of course, it is possible that a Snapchat investment could pay off for Yahoo, although the reported stake is relatively small. The startup has experienced impressive user growth in a short period of time and already has venture backing from some high profile investors with proven track records of success.
A Yahoo spokeswoman declined to comment Monday.

Optimism up in CII  Ficci surveysOptimism up in CII, Ficci surveys
BS Reporter | New Delhi Oct 07, 2014 12:50 AM IST
India Inc’s confidence in the economy has risen after the Narendra Modi government took over, show surveys by both the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).
Both surveys covered about 150 companies. The CII one also showed companies were more  optimistic about their own performance. The Ficci one showed only marginal improvement. The CII survey is for the second quarter  of the current financial  year. That from Ficci was for the second quarter.
The survey  conducted by CII showed its Business Confidence Index (BCI) rose to a three-year high of 57.4 points in the  quarter  under review against 53.7 in the previous one. The BCI had been at an all-time  low of 45.7 in the second quarter of 2013-14. Before this, the BCI was higher at 62.5 points only in the first quarter of 2011-12.
A BCI over 50 points shows positive confidence, while one below that means it is weak.
Ficci’s survey revealed its BCI rose to a 15-quarter high of 72.7 points in the first quarter of 2014-15 against 69 in the previous one.  The confidence was low at 49 points in the first quarter of 2013-14.
The second quarter  of FY15, covered by CII, entirely represents  the Modi government in office. The first quarter, reviewed by Ficci, partly represents the period of the new regime. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government took the oath of office  on May 26.
As such, CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee attributed the index surge to the new government. “The  determination shown at the Centre to provide an impetus to  growth, along with reviving the ‘feel good factor’, has sent the index soaring for the second quarter in a row,” he said.
It must  be ensured that this momentum is maintained, he said.
The Ficci survey  did not give any overt credit to the  Modi  government but specifically asked the respondents about the ‘Make in India’ vision of the new prime minister. The  respondents  said the sectors in question—  engineering, iron and steel, electrical and electronic products, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, automobiles and auto components, food processing  and agro-based industries, textiles and defence equipment— should  be made to ramp up manufacturing  capacities.
Respondents were also asked by Ficci about the cabinet’s recent  approval to the proposal to amend  three labour laws — Apprenticeship Act, Factories Act and Labour Act. A majority  of the  companies said the laws needed to be made industry-friendly and transparent. They said due importance should be given  to the welfare of employees and employers.
The highest percentage (41 per cent) of the respondents in the CII survey expected the gross domestic product  to grow by 5-5.5 per cent. About 30 per cent pegged it at 5.5-6 per cent. This  is  in line with the Reserve Bank’s  projections of five to six per cent, with the central estimate coming at 5.5 per cent. The economy rose 5.7 per cent  in the first quarter of the current financial year, after below-five per cent expansion in 2012-13 and 2013-14.
As many as 93 per cent  of those covered in the  Ficci  survey said they expected the overall economic situation to be better over the next six months.  
The expectation of higher economic growth  in the current  financial year is  rooted in optimism  about the overall demand situation in the CII  survey. A significant 77 per cent of respondents expected their sales to increase in the July-September quarter, much higher than 50 per cent in the previous quarter. Similarly,  49 per cent of the respondents expected their export orders to increase in the  second quarter, compared to 39 per cent in the previous one.
However, in the Ficci survey, the  improvement  in these parameters was felt to be marginal. As many as 64 per cent of the respondents felt  that sales would  be higher in the next six months, compared to 62 per cent in the previous one. And, 45 per cent of the companies in the first quarter felt their exports would be higher in the next six months, against 41 per cent in the previous quarter.

Modis assets fall by Rs. 26 lakh in six monthsThe Hindu Prime Minister Narendra Modi
TOPICS

Senior members of the NDA government have seen a fall in their wealth before and after the elections, but the change is not explained by their official spending on the elections.
The details of the assets of Cabinet Ministers were uploaded to the Prime Minister’s website on Monday, and offered a comparison with the assets declared by ministers just a few months ago, before the general election.
The Prime Minister has seen a Rs.26-lakh fall in his assets from the pre-election Rs.1.52 crore to Rs.1.26 crore as of August. The outflow has been from his bank deposits and fixed deposits, a close look at Election Commission documents shows. However, this change is not explained by his election expenses; as per official records, Mr. Modi spent only Rs.27,000 of his personal funds on his two parliamentary campaigns in Vadodara and Varanasi, the rest of his poll expenditure coming from party funds.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s declaration on the PMO website does not specify whether the assets declared are from before or after the election, but there is a nearly Rs.5-lakh increase between the assets declared by Mr. Singh before the election and the assets now uploaded to the PMO website. Mr. Singh officially spent Rs.1 lakh of his own money on his election campaign in Lucknow.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s assets as on the PMO website have not been updated after the elections, dating back to March of this year. In April this year, when she filed her nomination, Ms. Swaraj declared assets worth Rs.17.55 crore.
Finance and Defence Minister Arun Jaitley is over Rs.97 lakh richer than when he filed his nomination for his unsuccessful campaign from Amritsar. The major change is his purchase in April this year of a house in Amritsar, which he had hoped to make his constituency. Mr. Jaitley declared having spent just Rs.50,000 of his own money on his election campaign.
Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari is roughly Rs.20,000 poorer after the election, but spent just over Rs.7 lakh on his campaign, official documents show.

Gujarat CM remarks lend bite to MNS  Sena attack on ModiGujarat CM remarks lend bite to MNS, Sena attack on Modi
Written by Dipti Singh | Mumbai |       October 7, 2014 8:11 am
Comments
Gujarat Chief Minister Anandi Patel’s recent speech in Mumbai inviting investors to Gujarat has provided fodder for the poll campaign of the MNS and the Shiv Sena, which have seized the opportunity to tell people in the state that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was intent on robbing Mumbai of its status as the country’s financial capital.
After The Indian Express reported Patel’s September 27 address industrialists and investors in Mumbai in which she talked of city’s notorious traffic while wooing investors to Gujarat, the Shiv Sena was first to respond with a scathing editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana a few days ago.
MNS chief Raj Thackeray too raised the matter at his rally in Bhandup on Sunday, where he regretted endorsing Narendra Modi for the post of Prime Minister and attacked him saying he continued to “think” and endorse Gujarat everywhere he went. “While Modi comes and talks about the development of Maharashtra, Anandi Patel, who was picked by him as his successor, comes to Mumbai and tells investors to come to Gujarat and invest there. What is your hidden agenda? Why should Anandi Patel come to Mumbai and invite investors to Gujarat, that too when elections are round the corner,” the MNS chief said.
“I was the first person in the country to say that Modi should become the PM. However, now I am really surprised on whatever is doing. I thought he will change after becoming the PM, but Gujarat still seems to be his priority and nothing apart from that seems to be important,” Thackeray said. Taking a dig at Modi, Thackeray said the perception of a “Gujarati” PM had not gone unnoticed even by the Obama administration. “Recently, Modi went to America. Obama greeted him in Gujarati by saying ‘Kem Cho’ (How are doing?).

Karnataka lawyers clarify on SPPs appointmentUpdated: October 7, 2014 08:06 IST
Karnataka lawyers clarify on SPP’s appointment
Special Correspondent

Special Arrangement A file photo of Bhavani Singh
The prosecution team in the former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa’s appeal in the Karnataka High Court against her conviction by a special court said on Monday that it was functioning under a GO issued by the Karnataka government in 2013 and not the one issued by Tamil Nadu’s Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC).
Speaking to The Hindu on the phone, Murugesh Mardi, who is assisting Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Bhavani Singh in the case, said that since Ms. Jayalalithaa filed an appeal in the High Court, it meant the trial process was still not complete. “There is no need to issue a new notification for appointment of the SPP. Technically, since the appeal is only a continuation of the trial, the 2013 GO appointing Mr. Singh as the SPP still holds good,” he said.
Asked why Mr. Singh claimed in the court on September 30 that he was “yet to be communicated about his appointment as the SPP” if the 2013 notification was still valid, Mr. Mardi said the stand was taken as a newspaper reported that a new GO was issued by the Karnataka government.
“We did not want to take the risk of representing without seeing the new notification. But it turned out that there was no such new GO,” he pointed out.
About the DVAC notification, he said it was a technical matter to ensure logistics support, including fees and other expenses. “We have been appointed by the Karnataka government,” he reiterated.
Official sources said in Chennai that the appointment of the SPP was based on a notification issued by the Karnataka government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court. This was in compliance with the Supreme Court’s order.
The appointment was for the entire case, and not in stages. Though the trial was completed, the case was still alive, and the notification (appointing the SPP) valid. The DVAC was only informed of it and had no role in the appointment. There was no provision to appoint a separate SPP for appeals, the sources clarified.

Weigel Broadcasting, which owns MeTV, is launching new digital TV network, H&I, with classic cop shows
Chicago-based Weigel Broadcasting has quietly launched a new digital TV network featuring iconic police shows such as “Hill Street Blues” and “NYPD Blue.”
The new network is called H&I, which stands for Heroes and Icons. It went live in Chicago Monday on Channel 23.2, and also hit the air in Milwaukee, with plans to add a South Bend, Ind., TV station and Chicago cable systems soon, according to Neal Sabin, vice chairman of Weigel Broadcasting.

The so-called diginet will provide programming for the digital subchannels of broadcast TV stations and on cable systems, a platform that family-owned Weigel Broadcasting pioneered through its MeTV network, which beats many cable networks in the ratings in markets across the U.S.
Weigel, which also owns WCIU-Ch. 26 in Chicago, along with stations in Milwaukee and South Bend, launched MeTV in 2010. The classic television network has some 160 broadcast affiliates reaching 91 percent of TV households.

Since Friday evening, 3 killed (one 14 yrs) and 22 wounded on the city streets - an average weekend. So maybe Chicago is trying to make itself feel better by watching shows where the good guys actually have control of the situation.

Laundry service app launches in ChicagoLaundry service app launches in Chicago
On-demand laundry app Washio launches in Chicago
Washio, the on-demand laundry startup, officially launched in Chicago Wednesday. The app provides users with a door-to-door dry cleaning and laundry service.

Got laundry? In Chicago, there's an app for that.
Washio, a laundry service app, will send someone to pick up your laundry and return it, folded, in 24 hours.
Need your laundry done? There's an app for that.
Starting Wednesday in Chicago, the busy and the lazy can place an order on their phones to Washio to have their laundry picked up by runners — they are called "ninjas" — washed, folded and returned within 24 hours.
  Open link
Washio is the latest to join Chicago's sharing economy. Such businesses rely on sharing human or physical resources or both. For example, the launch in 2000 of Zipcar, a membership-based car rental company, paved the way for Uber and Lyft, which involve drivers using their personal cars like cabs. Chicago has Instacart, a grocery shopping and delivery service. Companies like TaskRabbit send someone to run your errands for a fee.
Washio launched in Los Angeles a year and a half ago and expanded to San Francisco and Washington. The company won $10.5 million in venture capital funding in June and plans to expand to 10 to 20 additional cities in the next year and 60 cities in five years, the company said.
That doesn't necessarily mean Chicagoans will be open to using the business, said Linda Darragh, a Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management entrepreneurship professor.

Quality will be the biggest concern, Darragh said. Customers will be hesitant about whether clothes will be well cared for and washed to their particular standards, she said.
"Transparency does a lot to mitigate these quality and safety issues," said Darragh, also executive director of the Levy Institute for Entrepreneurial Practice. She said she would want to know where her laundry will go to be washed and dried.
Though Washio teams with a laundry and dry cleaning service, Chief Operations Officer Juan Dulanto said the company doesn't disclose the names of those partners.
"We want to make sure it seems like it's magic," Dulanto said. "We believe the best way to create the best customer service is to own that whole process."

I have used Pressed as well and they are excellent. They are also a local Chicago based company. Prices are hands down the cheapest I have seen downtown but they pick up and deliver where I live as well. I have them pick up from my job downtown and deliver to my home in Lakeview. I always laugh...

The laundry service costs $1.60 per pound, and dry cleaning is on a per-item basis. Washio also has a delivery fee for orders less than $35 and an order minimum of $20.
"We really try to be in the median price range," said CEO Jordan Metzner. "We're not the cheapest, but we try to have fair market prices."
After customers download the app (for iOS or Android operating systems), they register and select a time for pickup, which is a 30-minute time slot. Customers are texted when drivers are on their way and when they arrive. Customers can leave their dirty laundry outside their door, or explain to the drivers stains or missing buttons that need to be remedied.
Adenrele Ojo, an actress from Los Angeles, said her work in that city as a Washio ninja usually means she has driven to a distribution center, where the clothes are sorted, by 6 a.m. She grabs her supplies, including laundry sacks and garment bags.
When she arrives at a home, directed by her Washio app that runs on a real-time algorithm based on customer requests and availability, she asks a few questions: Any issue with scented detergents? Need allergen-free? Want starch on those shirts or a crease in the pants?
Within 24 hours, she or another driver appears back at the customer's doorstep with the laundry. Customers get an itemized receipt emailed to them after drop-off.
Washio's ninjas work only the hours they want.
Ojo said she drives 20 to 50 hours a week with Washio, and also works as a photographer and producer.
"A lot of what we do as artists, particularly on the actor side, is auditioning," Ojo said. "In the meantime, while we're getting gigs, hopefully building up to larger gigs, it definitely helps balance out the finances. When you have slower times on the creative side, you can pick up more time at Washio."
Washio drivers must have a vehicle that's not older than a 2000 model.
The company had 20 runners ready to roll on launch day in Chicago. They will be paid $7 per stop, and, on average, they will work in 2 1/2-hour chunks, 16 to 18 hours per week.
Bryan Griesbaum applied for the Washio ninja position in Chicago after he saw an ad on Craigslist.
He plans to finish a degree at DePaul University soon and likes that he can switch between full time and part time whenever he wants.
He said he thinks the business idea is "brilliant."
Laundry "is so tedious for all of us," Griesbaum said. "I know if I were able to have someone pick stuff up right at my door, that would be a whole load off my shoulders."
No pun intended.

FY15 GDP growth: Will weak credit growth play spoiler?
CNBC-TV18’s Gopika Gopakumar moderated a session with a host of banker chiefs such as UCO Bank’s Arun Kaul, Canara Bank’s RK Dubey and IIFCL’s SB Nayar to check with them if the banking system, with its current credit growth rate, can support 5.7 percent or 5.8 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth that is being expected this year.

Fuelling growth, prospects, challenges and road ahead: that was the big theme at the CII 7th Banking Colloquium held in Kolkata in September this year. It even brought together some of the best minds in the banking industry.
It also saw the release of the CII Deloitte report on the role of banks in a new phase of growth. The report release was followed by a panel discussion which included the heads of banks and other financial institutions.
Even as the market is optimistic about green shoots being visible in the economic recovery, credit growth remains weak, having fallen to the lowest in five years in the fortnight ending September 5.
CNBC-TV18’s Gopika Gopakumar moderated a session with a host of banker chiefs such as UCO Bank’s Arun Kaul, Canara Bank’s RK Dubey and IIFCL’s SB Nayar to check with them if the banking system, with its current credit growth rate, can support 5.7 percent or 5.8 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth that is being expected this year.
Gopika: Bankers are hoping for 14-15percent credit growth for this year but looking at the numbers that we saw last week are you optimistic that bankers will be able to achieve a credit growth target of 13-14 percent?
Kaul: I agree, if you look at the growth, recent figures that have come out, it is below 10 percent. It is probably the lowest we have seen in many quarters in the last many years. However let’s not forget two things, one this is a slack season for credit demand. Normally credit growth starts in the second half of the year. Since we still are very large agro-based economy, they start accumulating the raw material in the second half.
However, we do notice not many new projects coming up, not much investments taking place. The growth in the credit we see in the banking industry is primarily coming either from the push the banks are giving on the retail side retail, retail, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and agriculture or the demand comes from the corporate sector because of the enlarged working capital requirements.
Now, since the second half, growth is normally there; it is a busy season. We do expect that banks will come to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expectation of 13-14 growth by end of the year.
If you look at the past many years the major growth in credit comes from the fourth quarter. So I hope this year also same trend would continue although the first two quarters or till now the growth is lower compared to previous years but I hope that the second half of the year we will see a good growth and probably we can reach 13-14 percent as projected by RBI.
Gopika: So therefore you are saying that GDP growth of 5-5.8 percent is certainly possible for this year?
Kaul: Should be possible; that is what RBI projections are. If we are able get 13-14 percent growth of credit, we should be able to get a GDP growth of 5 5.5-6 percent.
Q: Are you also sanguine about achieving your credit growth targets for this year?
Dubey: We are already on a way to achieve, we will surely achieve. We had been very aggressive on priority sector, micro, small & medium enterprises department (MSME) and retail portfolio where the growth had been priority sector about 30 percent plus, retail around 40 percent and MSME around 30 percent.
Corporate credit growth the wholesale business is around 10-12 percent; it is much lesser but we found some pickup in some sectors where our existing clients had been coming. Projects which were stuck up are coming on way. So, I hope even if 12-13 percent corporate growth is there we could definitely achieve our credit growth in Canara Bank.
Q: We have seen a spate of measures taken by the RBI. In order to stimulate growth clearly we need to step up funding for infrastructure. Do you think regulations or measures like the 5:25 rule which RBI has come out with to help infrastructure financing can really solve this problem at this point in time?
Nayar: I really don’t think it can solve this problem in a very short period. The 5:25 scheme itself which took us two years to convince RBI now to carry it on board, basically it was to reduce the fear of lending to large projects in infrastructure because the risk of non-performing assets (NPAs) goes down, the recessing goes down.
However that will take some time, banks have to put through a credit policy and that has to be approved by the board it will take sometime to take off. However, the given scenario now, like Mr. Dubey said there are not many new projects coming up. If at all any credit growth will take place it must be through cross-over and funding, which almost every single project is coming up with. Not entirely to be blamed to the project promoters or the projects, it is due to factors outside their control.
However other then that we will have to wait for some more time. In fact we have been holding this investor relations meetings, I just came back from some meetings in London and Germany. They are all saying that we would like to invest in India, we are watching India keenly but then there is still a lot more things you need to do in addition to improving the segment. They say that you also need to make it a much easier place to do business with.
Investors are comparing India to other countries, they say India is still a very difficult place to deal with. So this needs to be changed also. Additionally even if the investment climate improves for large projects and infrastructure, I don’t know what will be the capability of the banks to lend further because we are all aware of Basel III coming in, we are all aware of the capital requirements, we are all aware the constraints in capital funding and also the sectors caps and these last two years have also been a bitter lesson for the banks. I think they will approach these projects little more cautiously. So therefore we also need to look at outside the bank to fund these projects.

With the rise in access to internet and smartphones, more transactions are conducted online today than earlier. Even a lot of shopping is done online. No wonder most bank accounts come with a free ATM-cum-Debit card. You also get access to internet and mobile banking facilities.
Here are five reasons why you should take advantage of the debit card and online banking facilities:
1. Access your bank account any time, any where: Online banking provides users the flexibility to bank securely anytime and anywhere – provided you have access to the internet. You can use your computer or even your smartphone to check your balance, transfer money and make bill payments on the go. Although mobile banking services are generally free of charge, you may incur charges depending upon your mobile service provider and your data plan.
2. Track your account balance to avoid overdraft fees: Caught in the routine, it can get challenging for you to keep a track of your money while balancing between your family and work. Online banking works as your one-stop resort to help you keep a tab on your money as well as account balances. In fact, many banks provide the facility to set up online alerts to notify when your balance runs low, bill payments due, when your paycheck is deposited directly into your account, and a whole lot more. This can help you avoid penalty fees banks may charge if you withdraw more money than available from your account.
3. Make organized bill payments: Paying your bills has never been as quick and easy as they are now with mobile banking facilities. You can now get over the hassle of making multiple trips to the banks and also forget about carrying paper bills. Furthermore, you can stop worrying about cheques getting misplaced. Moreover, paying bills online helps maintain your online-billing records securely at one easy-to-retrieve place. In fact, you can also set up an automatic payment system by making use of your debit or credit cards.
4. Keep a track of how much you pay and to whom: Whether your friends need money transfer or your children are studying in a college, online banking offers instant money-transfer options. This makes it easy to transfer funds on the go. In fact, many online banking systems allow you to see how much you have paid to someone over a certain period of time. So, when tax sessions roll out, you can easily access a record of all the online payments you have made so far.
5. Financial planning: Whether you are single or married, young or old, financial planning is important. Online banking helps you plan your finances in an organized manner. This helps you calculate your net savings today, plan where you want to be tomorrow and strategize how to get there. This way, you can efficiently prepare yourself to meet any type of unforeseen circumstances in your family and effectively use your funds as and when needed.

Russia's Rosneft offers stake in an oilfield to ONGC Videsh

Russia's Rosneft offers stake in an oilfield to ONGC Videsh
Rosneft has made a formal offer to sell 10 percent in the strategic oilfield in Siberia to ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of the state-owned explorer, sources privy to the development said.

On the heels of selling a 10 percent stake in its Vankor oilfield to China for USD 1 billion, Russia's biggest oil company Rosneft has offered a similar stake to Oil and Natural Gas Corp ( ONGC ).
Rosneft has made a formal offer to sell 10 percent in the strategic oilfield in Siberia to ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of the state-owned explorer, sources privy to the development said.
Last month, Rosneft sold a 10 percent stake in the Vankor cluster fields in northern Siberia to China's CNPC for about USD 1 billion.
Vankor is the largest field to have been discovered and brought into production in Russia in the last 25 years. As of January 1, 2014 the initial recoverable reserves in the Vankor field are estimated at 500 million tonnes of oil and condensate, and 182 billion cubic meters of gas.
Sources said OVL is doing due diligence on the proposal and will make an offer post that.
Vankor will reach peak output of 500,000 barrels per day or 25 million tons a year in 2019. The field, has driven recent Russian output growth, pumped 435,000 bpd in September. Russia is the world's top oil producer with current output of 10.5 million bpd but its key producing region - West Siberia - is maturing.
Russia and Rosneft are courting China and India after the European Union and the US slapped sanctions on them for Moscow's involvement in Ukraine.
The sanctions would further restrict Rosneft's access to foreign loans, prohibiting the company from receiving any loans with more than 30 days maturity. Rosneft's finances have been strained by EU and US sanctions.
Prior to offering stake in Vankor, Rosneft had on August 5 sent a formal proposal to OVL for joint development of Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye oilfield in eastern Siberia.
The field is estimated to hold 991 million barrels of oil equivalent reserves and is planned to start production in 2017. Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye will reach a production plateau of up to 5 million tonnes a year (100,000 barrels per day) in 2019.
Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil company and the world's largest listed producer by output, offered to make a management presentation along with physical data room (PDR) access to OVL in Moscow, sources said.
OVL is interested in expanding its presence in Russia as it looks to source one million barrels per day of oil and oil-equivalent gas from Russia.
OVL already has 20 percent stake in Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Far East Russia and in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia, for USD 2.1 billion.
ONGC stock price
On November 24, 2014, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation closed at Rs 380.70, down Rs 2.9, or 0.76 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 472.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 264.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 26.00 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 14.64. The latest book value of the company is Rs 159.81 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 2.38.

Conservative Muslim clerics condemn #HajjSelfies as they flood social media

Mina (Saudi Arabia): Raising his arm, Yousef Ali hugs his elderly father in front of one of Islam's holiest sites as they grin for a selfie -- a craze that has hit this year's hajj.
But not everyone is happy about young pilgrims from around the world constantly snapping "selfies", photographs taken of one's self, as they carry out the rites of hajj which are the high point of a Muslim's spiritual life.
From Tawaf -- circling the holy Kaaba structure in Mecca -- to prayers atop Mount Mercy in Arafat, and stoning of the "devil" in Mina, the key stages of hajj have all been recorded on cameras and smartphones for posterity, and for instant sharing through social media.
The increasingly popular phenomenon has sparked controversy among more conservative Muslims, however, with some taking to Twitter to criticise pilgrims who take selfies.
#hajj selfies #pilgrimage #conservative clerics #ban
Hajj is the one of the world's largest religious gatherings. It has attracted over two million believers this year.
"As this is my first pilgrimage, it is important for me to document all the events taking place around me," Ali, 24, told AFP, snapping a picture of himself with a green sign reading "Big Jamarah", which refers to a wall where Muslims ritually stone Satan.
"Wherever I go, I take pictures, especially since nowadays we have these little cameras... that offer a full view of the area," the bearded Kuwaiti, casually dressed in sweatpants and a pair of trendy sandals, said with a smile.
The increasingly popular phenomenon has sparked controversy among more conservative Muslims, however, with some taking to Twitter to criticise pilgrims who take selfies.
"When we went for umra in the mid-90s, Dad nearly had his camera confiscated to shouts of 'haram!' Now, #HajjSelfie is A Thing. What a world," wrote one Tweeter.
Another user named Kahwaaa wrote: "It's a time to connect to allah and purify my soul. #hajjselfies selfies shouldn't be taken."
But others said the issue was being blown out of proportion.
"People creating a huge issue about #hajjselfies. If photos are allowed during Hajj then what is wrong with selfies?," asked Abdul Mufeez Shaheed.
Nothing at all, says Ali's father Mohammed Ali, 65.
"A person taking such pictures is documenting a rare event", a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many Muslims, he said, wearing a traditional white robe.
"This is a symbolic place representing history," Mohammed Ali added, pointing to the three sites which pilgrims began stoning on Saturday at the start of the Eid al-Adha feast of sacrifice, which is celebrated by Muslims worldwide.
Two women covered in traditional black abayas and veils hurried towards the Big Jamarah wall, but not without stopping for a quick self portrait along the way.
"My daughter and I are taking selfies to show our hajj pictures to our family in Paris. It's also a nice memento," said one of the women, a Saudi pilgrim from Jeddah who gave her name only as Umm Abdallah, 44.
Her daughter Wafaa Ahmed, 19, said: "I love taking many selfies wherever I go to keep them for myself, as well as to show them to my friends and brothers."
Speaking to AFP by telephone, a professor of Islamic Sharia law in the Saudi capital Riyadh said that "if photographs are only for personal memory and not for disseminating, then no problem.
"But if they were for the purpose of showing off, then they are prohibited, such as the photography that takes place at the (hajj) rites."
The scholar requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of stating a religious opinion in the ultra-conservative kingdom.
"It is better for Muslims to avoid them," he said of selfies.
For the teenage pilgrim Wafaa Ahmed, "this is not a convincing view" because taking selfies "has nothing to do with religion".
The elderly pilgrim Mohammed Ali also discounts the scholar's opinion.
He says the camera "is a tool such as mobiles, used even by religious scholars who have not prohibited them, so why prohibit another tool of the modern era?"
As he speaks, a group of young Saudi men gather for a group selfie in front of a Jamarah wall before they stone the "devil".

Shashi Tharoor slams Modi government over Pakistan violations

Thiruvananthapuram: After the warning by the Congress in Kerala that he stop praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party MP Shashi Tharoor on Monday appeared to do some damage control, slamming the BJP government over ceasefire violations by Pakistan.
"Deeply concerned by reports of 5 killed&50 injured in Pakistani shelling today. Over 100 ceasefire violations on LoC since BJP came to power!," Tharoor tweeted.
After the Congress criticism and the party not ruling out disciplinary action against him, the former Union Minister earlier in the day sought to put the record straight holding that he is a "proud Congressman" and had not even remotely endorsed the "Hindutva agenda" of the BJP.
"Deeply concerned by reports of 5 killed&50 injured in Pakistani shelling today. Over 100 ceasefire violations on LoC since BJP came to power!," Tharoor tweeted.
#congress #shashi tharoor #narendra modi #pakistan
Indicating that disciplinary action could be considered against Tharoor if he kept on lauding Modi's initiatives, KPCC Vice-President M M Hassan said "as a first step, we are asking him to stop praising Modi as his stance went totally against the Congress's ideals."
Expressing his strong displeasure, KPCC president V M Sudheeran said Tharoor should not be oblivious of the fact that he had been elected on the Congress ticket.
Sudheeran also indicated that, if necessary, disciplinary action would be initiated against Tharoor after consulting with other leaders if he kept on eulogising Modi.

Bangalore: The Karnataka High Court will hear on Tuesday AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa's plea seeking immediatebail and suspension of her four-year sentence in an 18-year-old disproportionate assets case. Bracing up for the anticipated entry of AIADMK supportersand leaders into the city from the Hosur border, the police have tightened security in and around the High Court and Parappana Agrahara Central Prison, where Jayalalithaa is lodged since September 27.
The High Court vacation bench had on October 1 deferred till October 7 pleas of Jayalalithaa and her close aide Sasikala and her relatives VN Sudhakaran and Elavarasi, who were also convicted in the case, to be taken by a regular bench after the end of Dasara vacation.
"We have made all security arrangements to avoid any untoward incidents. We have information on a lot of AIADMK supporters and leaders flocking to the city from the border areas of Hosur," ACP (Law and Order) Alok Kumar. The police are prepared for the influx of AIADMK supporters and leaders, who are camping in various lodges and resorts on the eve of Jayalalithaa's bail plea hearing, Kumar said. "Let them come. We have handled the situation on earlier occasions--on the verdict day and bail plea hearing days. We will handle the situation this time too," Kumar said.
The High Court vacation bench had on October 1 deferred till October 7 pleas of Jayalalithaa and other three, who were also convicted in the case, to be taken by a regular bench after the end of Dasara vacation.
#tamil nadu #aiadmk #j jayalalithaa #karnataka high court
Section 144 of the CrPC has been clamped within one km radius of the High Court and Parapanna Agrahara Prison, where Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Elavarasi are also lodged. As many as 500 and 1,000 police personnel have been deployed in areas surrounding the High Court and Parapanna Agrahara jail, respectively, Kumar said.
He said 500 police personnel, including from Karnataka State Reserve Police Force and City Armed Reserve, and two DCPs and five ACPs would be deployed at the High Court. 1,000 personnel, including four DCPs and six ACPs and personnel from KSRP and CAR, will be deployed around the jail premises, Kumar added.
Jayalalithaa's counsel Ram Jethmalani had on October 1 pleaded for suspension of the sentence pending appeal and for her release on bail, which was opposed by Special Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh, who was the SPP in the Special Court in the disproportionate assets case. In his verdict on September 27, Special Judge John Michael D'Cunha had convicted Jayalalithaa, sentencing her to four years imprisonment, and slapped a staggering fine of Rs 100 crore in the corruption case.
Sasikala, Sudhakaran, disowned foster son of the former Chief Minister, and Elavarasi were also sentenced to four years in jail, besides a fine of Rs 10 crore each. In her petitions seeking immediate bail and challenging her sentence, Jayalalithaa has maintained that the charges of amassing wealth against her were false and that she had acquired property through legal means.

Delhi: Woman raped for years  rescued; accused nabbed10
0
New Delhi: A woman who was raped by her landlord for three years and forced into sex trade, was rescued by her two friends from her rented house here, police said on Monday. The accused has been arrested.
The woman, 21, was rescued Sunday from a house in Vasant Vihar in south Delhi.
Vinod Kumar, a property dealer and the landlord at whose house the woman was a tenant, was arrested a few hours after the woman lodged a complaint against him and her medical examination confirmed rape.
The woman, 21, was rescued Sunday from a house in Vasant Vihar in south Delhi.
#rape #vasant vihar #landlord #arrest
The woman who hails from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, had come to Delhi four years ago in search of a job.
One of her friends introduced her to Kumar who gave her his Munirka residence in Vasant Vihar area on rent at a nominal charge. Since then, she was residing there.
Police said three years ago, Kumar offered the victim a drink laced with sedative and raped her.
"When the victim came to know about the act and threatened Kumar she would file a complaint against him, he promised to marry her soon. Thereafter, he repeatedly raped her for over a year on the pretext of marriage," said a police official, citing the woman's statement.
Meanwhile, the woman said in her statement, Kumar made two MMSes -- one in a compromising position with her and another in which he was beating her up.
Kumar threatened to upload the video on internet.
"A year ago, Kumar forced the victim into prostitution and earned money by providing her services to various men," said the official.
The woman somehow managed to inform the friend who had initially introduced her to Kumar.
Posing as customers, the woman's two friends managed to take her out of the rented house and inform the police.

Burdwan bombers were working on rocket launchersBurdwan bombers were working on rocket launchers
Shishir Gupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 07, 2014
First Published: 00:12 IST(7/10/2014) | Last Updated: 07:21 IST(7/10/2014)
The terror group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) was planning to make rocket launchers with lathe machines, using designs downloaded from the internet on mobile phones, counter-terror agencies investigating the October 2 blast at Burdwan in West Bengal have uncovered.
Two alleged Bangladeshi bomb makers — Shamim Shakil Ahmed and Svopan Mondal — died in the explosion.
Abdul Hakim — also injured in the blast — confirmed that the entire group, including the two dead, belonged to the JMB, a terror outfit linked to the banned Jamaat-e-Islami that is bitterly opposed to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Hakim, however, refused to give out further details, saying he didn’t trust the Indian police.
Ahmed’s wife Rumi Bibi stated that the group was trying to reproduce the weapons using a lathe machine, investigators said.
Photos of rocket launcher designs and projectiles were found in the records of mobile phones destroyed in the blast, sources added.
Investigators have also pieced together evidence using IMEI numbers of the mobile phones to trace JMB operatives.
Meanwhile, the CID on Monday intensified its search of a Bangladeshi national and JMB operative named Kausar who took delivery of a consignment of IEDs.
Rumi Bibi had told security agencies that they sent four consignments of bombs in the last three months through Kausar and another man called Rasiq.
Read: 2 women held, cops hunt for links to other terror outfits
Investigations showed Kausar was the main motivator and carried bombs in a black rucksack along with Rasiq. Despite having their phone records, Indian and Bangladeshi agencies haven’t been able to trace the duo.
As reported by HT, 25 hand grenades, some 10 ready-for-use IEDs and large quantities of ammonium nitrate, iron oxide, hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals used in making bombs were recovered from the spot after the October 2 blast, sources said.
With the NIA and Intelligence Bureau teams helping the state police investigations, security teams are using call data records of the deceased and the injured to track their accomplices in India and pass the numbers on to Bangladesh intelligence agencies.
Investigators are trying to find out if the JMB module had links with three terrorists whose details Dhaka had forwarded to New Delhi. As the JMB group had a Kashmiri chapter in the 1990s, agencies are also focusing on any links with terror groups in the Valley.
Due to the international ramifications of the case, however, the home ministry is still awaiting consent from the Mamata Banerjee government to hand over the probe to the National Investigation Agency.
The West Bengal government on its part is trying to downplay the Bangladesh angle lest it be accused of harbouring terrorists opposed to the Hasina regime on Indian soil, sources said.

Jammu: There has been widespread condemnation against the unprovoked firing by the Pakistan in the Arnia forward belt of the RS Pura along the International Border (IB) in which five villagers lost their lives while 34 others were injured.
The state unit of Bhartya Janta Party (BJP) on Monday demanded 'stern action' against Pakistan for the unprovoked firing.
"Its high time to teach Pakistan a lesson", BJP MP, from Jammu Jugal Kishore Sharma said. "They resort to unprovoked firing every now and then and target our civilians. Last night they killed five villages that won't be tolerated. It's high time that Pakistan must be taught a lesson".
The state unit of Bhartya Janta Party (BJP) on Monday demanded 'stern action' against Pakistan for the unprovoked firing.
#india #pakistan #cross boarder firing #ceasefire violation
He said that incidents like these have crossed the threshold of tolerance of India and it was high time that Pakistan must be paid back in the same coin. "The union Home Minister has instructed our armed forces to respond Pakistani side. He has issued instructions that our side must respond with ten bullets if they fire one," the BJP MP  said.
Sharma appealed the Jammu and Kashmir government to provide free medical care to the injured. Shiv Sena held a anti-Pak protest demonstration against the ceasefire violation as the party activists also burnt the Pakistani flag.
"We want answer from the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not giving a befitting reply to Pakistan, as they continue to violate the ceasefire by shelling and firing upon our 25 border out posts and 19 villages along the International border in Jammu sector" state chief of Shiv Sena Ashok Gupta said.
Bahujan Samaj party also asked the prime minister to give a befitting response to Pakistan over last night's incident.

Pak must realise Modi govt not UPA: Rajnath SinghComments
Hours after five civilians were killed in shelling from across the border, home minister Rajnath Singh said Pakistan must realise that the Modi government was not the UPA that would take such aggression lying down.
India was for peaceful relations with the neighbouring country but not at the cost of civilians, the minister said. “If our civilians are killed, India has every right to retaliate,” Singh said in an interview to HT.
Ties between the two countries have soured ever since India called off talks with Pakistan in August. This year has specially been volatile along the border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, which is due for assembly polls.
Pakistan typically ratchets up border tensions every time the state holds elections.
“Pakistan must come to terms with the fact that the Modi government is not the previous UPA government which would take such provocations lying down. Zamaana badal gaya hai, fiza badal gai hai (times have changed, atmosphere has changed),” Singh said.
“We’ll not tolerate such acts of border violations by Pakistan. We are for peaceful relationship, but not at the cost of security of our civilians.” India was in a position to “give a befitting and decisive reply” if Pakistan continued to “provoke”. 
The tough talk came amid reports of the government instructing the Border Security Force (BSF) to “rain bullets” on Pakistani troops if they continue firing at Indian posts and civilians.
“Our jawans will not sit idle if civilians are attacked. If ceasefire violations continue, we have every right to retaliate with the entire force at our command,” Singh said.
The minister said India was ready for a “decisive dialogue” but the onus was on Pakistan. “They must stop ceasefire violations and start respecting the boundaries; only then can we think of holding a decisive dialogue,” he said.
The minister defended decision to pull out from foreign-secretary level talks, saying even Pakistan had admitted that the timing of the meeting between Kashmiri separatist leaders and its high commissioner was not right. “There is a possibility of talk but dialogue cannot be for mere talking. It has to be decisive.”

Boom times back in job market Recruiters th...Ajit Isaac
(The real recruitment spree…)
MUMBAI: Boom times back in the job market? Recruiters think so. Hiring data for the July-September quarter shows a two-year high and more than half a dozen recruiters reckon levels last seen during the 2007 boom will return in the next few months. The real recruitment spree will come when employers focus on talent for new jobs. Right now, the hiring is brisk thanks mostly to vacant positions being filled.
Top-Level hiring to be up after lag
For Bangalore-based Ikya Human Capital Solutions , the July-September period topped recruitment closures of the last seven years. "We closed around 4,000 positions in all, including 3,000 in temporary staffing. This is more than any quarter till seven years ago," said Ajit Isaac , chairman and MD of the recruitment firm that looks after middle order and temporary hiring. "There is a demand for managing directors in automotive, manufacturing and infrastructure projects," said R Suresh, managing director of RGF Executive Search.
The Japan-headquartered company also touched a 13-month high in its India numbers and closures were significantly higher than same period last year." Another recruitment company that looks mainly at IT middle management hiring said the two-year high includes counter-offers. "This is also good news because it shows mobility in markets and that candidates are willing to look at changes," said the company head, who refused to be named. Also clocking in its best quarter in a couple of years was Bangalore-based The Head Hunters.
Mandates for this recruitment company come from ecommerce, engineering and consumer sectors, according to Kris Lakshmikanth , chief executive of The Head Hunters (India). This September, the recruitment firm hired four senior members for a Canadian company that has operations in Chennai; the posts had been vacant for a while. Staffing companies like Randstad India as well have touched their two-year best this September. "Action from the new government is yet to be seen on ground but we expect larger orders to come in," said Aditya Narayan Mishra, president (staffing) at Randstad India. TeamLease clocked in its highest number of closures in 18 months.
"The number of openings per client has gone up. Earlier, if they wanted one person for the post of a bank manager, they are asking for five now," said co-founder and senior vice-president Rituparna Chakraborty . Brisk hiring will, however, not be in conjunction with any drastic changes in salary structures. Increment levels will be around 15-40% when changing jobs and compensation packages will see more long-term incentives. Hiring for top level talent is also expected to pick up - but after a lag.

AIADMK awaits Jayalalithaa s bail plea hearing todayAIADMK awaits Jayalalithaa's bail plea hearing today
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Chennai, October 06, 2014

A nervous and anxious AIADMK awaits Jayalalithaa’s bail plea hearing in Karnataka high court on Tuesday. On the eve of the hearing on Monday, party workers held protests and prayers across the state. Barring minor incidents, the protests were mostly peaceful.
Frontal organisations of the AIADMK have been mobilizing support for Amma’s release. On Tuesday, farmers across the state would also come out in support, an AIADMK functionary said.
The cadres are tense as they fear that a delay in securing bail may result in increased attacks on the government. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has already demanded the dismissal of TN government and imposition of President’s rule in the state.
“It is an anti-democratic demand to subvert a democratically-elected government,” said AIADMK office bearer, Avadi Kumar. “AIADMK protests are not causing any inconvenience to the people,” he added.
The opposition DMK and DMDK are slowly but surely coming out against the protests and are questioning how the protests were allowed without permission. DMDK chief Captain Vijayakanth questioned why Section 144 was not imposed in the state to check the protests.

DA case: Karnataka High Court to hear Jayalalithaa s bail plea today46
0
Bangalore: The Karnataka High Court will take up former Tamil Nadu chief minister and AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa's bail application on Tuesday in a disproportionate assets case. Jayalalithaa has sought immediate bail and suspension of her four-year sentence in an 18-year-old corruption case.
Bracing up for the anticipated entry of AIADMK supporters and leaders into the city from the Hosur border, the police have tightened security in and around the High Court and Parappana Agrahara Central Prison, where Jayalalithaa is lodged since September 27.
The High Court vacation bench had on October 1 deferred till October 7 pleas of Jayalalithaa and her close aide Sasikala and her relatives VN Sudhakaran and Ilavarasi, who were also convicted in the case, to be taken by a regular bench after the end of Dasara vacation.
In his verdict, Special Judge had convicted Jayalalithaa, sentencing her to four years imprisonment, and slapped a fine of Rs 100 crore in the corruption case.

"We have made all security arrangements to avoid any untoward incidents. We have information on a lot of AIADMK supporters and leaders flocking to the city from the border areas of Hosur," ACP (Law and Order) Alok Kumar.
The police are prepared for the influx of AIADMK supporters and leaders, who are camping in various lodges and resorts on the eve of Jayalalithaa's bail plea hearing, Kumar said. "Let them come. We have handled the situation on earlier occasions -- on the verdict day and bail plea hearing days. We will handle the situation this time too," Kumar said.
Section 144 of the CrPC has been clamped within 1 km radius of the High Court and Parapanna Agrahara Prison, where Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Ilavarasi are also lodged. As many as 500 and 1,000 police personnel have been deployed in areas surrounding the High Court and Parapanna Agrahara jail, respectively, Kumar said.
He said 500 police personnel, including from Karnataka State Reserve Police Force and City Armed Reserve, and two DCPs and five ACPs would be deployed at the High Court. 1,000 personnel, including four DCPs and six ACPs and personnel from KSRP and CAR, will be deployed around the jail premises, Kumar added.
Jayalalithaa's counsel Ram Jethmalani had on October 1 pleaded for suspension of the sentence pending appeal and for her release on bail, which was opposed by Special Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh, who was the SPP in the Special Court in the disproportionate assets case.
In his verdict on September 27, Special Judge John Michael D'Cunha had convicted Jayalalithaa, sentencing her to four years imprisonment, and slapped a staggering fine of Rs 100 crore in the corruption case. Sasikala, Sudhakaran, disowned foster son of the former chief minister, and Ilavarasi were also sentenced to four years in jail, besides a fine of Rs 10 crore each.
In her petitions seeking immediate bail and challenging her sentence, Jayalalithaa has maintained that the charges of amassing wealth against her were false and that she had acquired property through legal means.

No end to LoC stand-off; Pakistan violates ceasefire thrice in over 24 hours  firing on37
0
Srinagar: The stand-off between India and Pakistan is continuing to intensify in Jammu and Kashmir as Pakistani forces continue to target several Indian posts along the Line of Control. Pakistan has violated the ceasefire thrice in just over 24 hours.
Fresh firing has been reported by Pakistan at Poonch's Shahpur and BG sectors on Monday night. Firing is on in Rajouri too.
Five civilians were killed and 34 others were injured in firing by Pakistani troops on Monday in Jammu's Arnia sector.
#ceasefire violation #pakistan #india #line of control
Expressing concern over violence along the LoC, the US too has urged India and Pakistan
to engage in a dialogue process to address the border issues. "Well, we are concerned about any violence along the line of control. We continue to encourage the governments of India and Pakistan to engage in further dialogue to address these issues," State Department Spokesperson, Jen Psaki said.
"Our policy on Kashmir has not changed. We still believe that the pace, scope, and character of India and Pakistan's dialogue on Kashmir is for those two countries to determine," she said in response to a question.
Defence Minister Arun Jaitley has accused Pakistan of deliberately creating tension. Jaitley deplored the ceasefire violations from across the border and said the Indian armed forces were "fully ready" and are responding to each of these provocations from across the border.
Director General of the Border Security Force DK Pathak is in Jammu to take stock of the situation. "There are more casualties on the Pakistani side, according to their own media reports," Pathak said. "Since the new government took charge, we are at liberty to respond as the situation demands," he told CNN-IBN.
The Pakistani troops used small, automatic weapons and mortar bombs to target the border hamlets and BoPs. 29 of the injured have been shifted to GMC hospital in Jammu. Three others were brought dead, Chief Medical officer of the hospital Dr Ritesh Shan said.
"We have always been the sitting ducks on fire. The Pakistani side always attack the civilians in the area and we become the worst sufferers," said 70-year-old Bira Devi.
A large number of houses were damaged and livestock perished in the firing and shelling, said Devender Singh, who was leading a team that shifted the injured people to hospital during the heavy shelling. "People living in critical zones along the border will be evacuated," he said. The BSF spokesman said that the force did not suffer any casualty.
The Congress and BJP said the ceasefire violations by Pakistan were a "serious" issue and it should desist from such activities. "Whatever Pakistan is doing is certainly a serious matter. And we want to tell Pakistan that indulging in such activities is not good for that country," BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.
Condemning Pakistan's actions, former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. "There cannot be anything worse than this," the Congress leader said. Party leader and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, however, asked why Modi government was "keeping silent".
"It's most unfortunate that firing is going on from Pakistan side in Jammu and Kashmir and at this juncture any firing from across the border is very very critical. It's most unfortunate that the Government is also keeping silent," he said.

Man holding shoe walks towards Nitin Gadkari; beaten up bysupportersComments
Shoe in hand, a man apparently drunk tried to approach Nitin Gadkari as the BJP leader was ascending the stage of a rally in Kothrud, Pune, before BJP workers accosted and beat him up. Later identified as Bharat Karad, a resident of Sutardara and hailing from Latur district, he was detained by the police.
Joint Commissioner of Police Sanjay Kumar said Karad did not really throw the show at Gadkari.
Karad was wearing khadi trousers and most in the audience thought it was a clash between policemen and party workers over making way for Gadkari as he sought to mount the stage. Before Gadkari arrived, police had urged the organisers to vacate the path leading to the dais, but a large group remained there.
At the rally, Gadkari accused the Congress and the NCP of communalism and sectarianism to secure votes. He said neither party has a performance report to present and is therefore using divisive tactics.
“Congress-NCP introduced reservation for Marathas and promised the same for Dhangars,” he said, adding Congress always tried to woo the Muslim community, but in its regime the community members could only get “menial’ jobs.
“The Congress never had a vision of development for this country and banked on dynastic politics. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru gave a call for eradication of poverty years ago and his descendant Rahul Gandhi is still stuck to the same appeal. Where is the uplift of the poor in so many years?”

Elect a government that works in tandem with the Centre:ShahComments

BJP president Amit Shah on Monday urged the people of Maharashtra to vote for a government that works in tandem with the Centre in the upcoming Assembly polls.
Speaking at a poll rally in Hadapsar, where he was campaigning for BJP candidates from Hadapsar and Purandar Assembly seats Yogesh Tilekar and Sangita Nimbalkar, respectively, Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted Maharashtra to grow on all fronts and added that the state’s growth had suffered a setback in the Congress-NCP’s 15-year regime.
“Maharashtra is the growth engine of the country and if we want the state to develop, we need to give the BJP complete majority,’’ implored Shah. “Maharashtra should have a government that will work jointly with Narendra Modi at the Centre,” he said.
Shah further said Congress and NCP do not have leaders who can work in tandem with the Centre. “A CM who hesitates to attend functions for fear of being heckled will not be able to carry out the PM’s dream of taking the nation and all the states ahead,’’ he said.
Shah alleged the Congress and the NCP of being involved in rampant corruption. “Before asking for votes, they should answer queries about the 101 scams worth Rs 11.88 crore pointed out by our senior leader Eknath Khadse,’’ said Shah. He lambasted NCP president Sharad Pawar and said that despite being Union Agriculture Minister, Pawar could not prevent over 35,000 farmers’ suicides in the state.
“Maharashtra was among top performing states many years back. However, the Congress- NCP rule has not only brought the state’s development to a dismal level, but has also brought about corruption in the cooperative movement and operation of sugar factories,’’ he said.
Earlier, at a rally in Lonavala, Shah said prices have come down after Modi’s swearing-in and the trend would continue in the coming months.

Rajnath kicks off Gurgaon campaignRajnath kicks off Gurgaon campaign

Rajnath Singh at the Farrukhnagar rally on Monday.
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday kickstarted the BJP campaign in the high-profile district of Gurgaon ahead of Assembly elections on October 15.
The former BJP president, who was projected as a “messiah of farmers and son of a farmer”, held a rally for farmers of Farrukhnagar, a neglected block of Badshahpur constituency in Gurgaon district.
“Today, the sons of farmers are willing to work even as watchmen, or take up any odd job in the city, but are not interested in working as farmers. (To solve this) We can promote small scale industry and set up units here for industries such as food processing so that not only farmers get the right price for their produce but local youth also get employment,” he said. “We can set up a unit of manufacturing chips in the village so that potatoes grown locally can be used by the industry directly, without losing margins to middlemen.”
At the rally, which was attended by more than 1,000 people, Rajnath invoked the might of the central leadership which is “trying to make its presence felt across  the world”.
Canvassing for Rao Narbir, BJP candidate from Badshahpur, Rajnath said, “Dilli mein election jitwake, aapne kurta tho pehna diya; ab Haryana mein jitwake pyjama pehna do.”
Rao Narbir’s grandfather and father were politicians and represented their constituencies many times. Rao also became the youngest cabinet minister in Haryana in 1987, in the Devi Lal government. Often criticised for party-hopping, Narbir seeks to garner Ahir support and benefit from a pro-BJP wave in the area. Voters in Badshahpur comprise 85,000 Ahirs; 55,000 Jats; 25,000 Brahmins; 14,000 Rajputs; 11,000 Punjabis and 10,000 Banias.

Cameraman suffering from Ebola arrives in Nebraska

AP/The Providence Journal, Philip Marcelo In this August 2013 photo, Rhode Island native Ashoka Mukpo speaks with residents of an iron ore mining camp in Bong County, Liberia. Mr. Mukpo, who was diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia on Oct. 2 was flown on Monday to Omaha, Nebraska, for treatment.

viral diseases
An American video journalist who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia stepped off a jet on Monday under his own power on his way to a Nebraska hospital where he will be treated for the disease in a specialized containment unit.
Ashoka Mukpo, 33, was then loaded onto a stretcher for the ambulance ride to the Nebraska Medical Centre.
Mr. Mukpo was working as a freelance cameraman for NBC News when he became ill last week. He is the fifth American with Ebola to return to the U.S. for treatment during the latest outbreak, which the World Health Organization estimates has killed more than 3,400 people.
Mr. Mukpo’s parents said they tried to talk him out of going to Liberia last month, but he told them he wanted to help show the severity of the epidemic.
“I told him I thought he was crazy,” said his father, Dr. Mitchell Levy.
“And I begged him from a mother’s perspective, I said please don’t go,” Diana Mukpo said. “But there was nothing to do. He was determined.”
Before returning to Liberia last month, Mr. Mukpo had lived there for two years while working as a researcher for the Sustainable Development Institute, a nonprofit focused on the concerns of workers in mining camps outside Monrovia. He only returned home to Providence, Rhode Island, in May.
It’s not clear how Mr. Mukpo was infected, but Levy said it may have happened when he helped clean a vehicle someone died in.
During his treatment, his parents will have to rely on a video chat system in his hospital room to communicate with him.
Meanwhile in Texas, a Liberian man with Ebola who started showing symptoms while visiting the U.S. remained in critical condition at a Dallas hospital.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he would create a state task force to ensure Texas develops a rapid-response plan if an outbreak develops in the state.
Mr. Perry also called on federal officials to implement screening procedures at all U.S. points of entry. He said screeners should take travellers’ temperature and conduct other assessments to determine their overall health.
Doctors at the Nebraska isolation unit the largest of four in the U.S. will evaluate Mr. Mukpo before determining how to treat him. They said they will apply the lessons learned while treating American aid worker Rick Sacra, who was allowed to return home to Massachusetts after three weeks, on Sept. 25.
Sacra received an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola, as well as two blood transfusions from another American aid worker who recovered from Ebola at an Atlanta hospital. The transfusions are believed to help a patient fight off the virus because the survivor’s blood carries antibodies for the disease.
In Dallas, another man who recently travelled to the U.S. from Liberia was listed in critical condition. Thomas Eric Duncan has been hospitalized at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since Sept. 28.
Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC’s director, said he was aware that Duncan’s health had “taken a turn for the worse,” but he declined to elaborate.
Officials are monitoring the health of nearly 50 people who had varying degrees of contact with Duncan.
The virus that causes Ebola is not airborne and can only be spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen of an infected person who is showing symptoms.

HP faces uphill battle with newly minted PC unit
Global shipments of PCs are in for "slow but consistent" growth over the next few years, forecasts tech research firm Gartner, as they recover from three years of declines caused by a surge of tablets and smartphones. But they are still not expected to equal their 2011 peak until 2018 at the earliest.

HP faces uphill battle with newly minted PC unit
Global shipments of PCs are in for "slow but consistent" growth over the next few years, forecasts tech research firm Gartner, as they recover from three years of declines caused by a surge of tablets and smartphones. But they are still not expected to equal their 2011 peak until 2018 at the earliest.
Post your opinion here
 
Hewlett-Packard Co's Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman appeared to be banking on growth markets like 3D printing and a trickle back in PC sales when she announced on Monday a spin-off for the company's computer and printing business. But some on Wall Street are skeptical.
Investors and analysts generally gave a thumbs up on the move to separate HP's computer and printing business from its corporate hardware and services operations, sending its shares up almost 5 percent. Yet some questioned the move, expressing doubt over whether the newly christened "HP Inc" can break out of what appears to be a terminal slump in desktop computing.
“HP Inc will be a fairly good cash-generating machine but growth will certainly be a struggle," said Brian Fox, a portfolio manager at Standard Life Investments. "There's not a whole lot they can do to improve that growth profile.”
The split does creates a company with strong cash flows, a high dividend yield and a major market position. At the same time, though, it may raise operating costs over the longer term, and together with abortive talks to merge with EMC Corp, it could reflect HP's inability to grow profits organically, according to Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi.
Global shipments of PCs are in for "slow but consistent" growth over the next few years, forecasts tech research firm Gartner, as they recover from three years of declines caused by a surge of tablets and smartphones. But they are still not expected to equal their 2011 peak until 2018 at the earliest.
Moreover, that growth is not expected to come from HP's mainstay of desktops and laptops, but from a new breed of mobile computers such as Apple's MacBook Air, Google-powered Chromebooks and Microsoft's Surface Pro.
HP is a massive force in PCs and printing, which will account for about half the company's USD 112 billion revenue this fiscal year. But HP Inc "will likely be pitched as the slow/no growth, high cash generating business," Sacconaghi said in a research report. He estimated that HP Inc's revenue would decline at about 1 percent annually over the next few years.
"It is not clear if the separation would necessarily attract new classes of investors or 'unlock' value in the same way that other spin-offs do," Sacconaghi said.
HP shares are now up 78 percent over the last 12 months, compared to a 17 percent increase in the S&P 500. But the company is still one of the cheapest tech stocks, trading at around nine times earnings expected over the next 12 months, compared to an average close to 12 for large tech firms.
POST-PC BLUES
HP has struggled to adjust to the post-PC computing era, making a few false starts with early tablets, and surrendered its crown as the world's No. 1 PC maker to Lenovo.
The new company may need to do some mergers and acquisitions to change that, some analysts suggested, although it is not clear which rivals HP Inc might team up with.
Some say HP is moving in the right direction.
"They've had good numbers for the past several quarters both in the consumer and the enterprise side of the PC business, including the Windows tablet form factor," said Neil MacDonald, an analyst at Gartner. "HP has actually gained some market share back because of innovation and design."
Whitman emphasized on Monday that HP Inc will not focus on the consumer devices market dominated by Apple and Android devices, and instead will look to play to its strengths, such as with 3D printing.
"There’s lots of innovation (going on) but often not in the area that people expect," Whitman said in an interview. "It may show itself in unexpected ways."
“There’s still lots of opportunities in other adjacencies, where we don’t chase the market leaders," she added.
Having said that, PC growth will not be Whitman's most pressing concern. She is slated to be CEO of the other company, to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, focusing on tech infrastructure, software and services.
ADDITIONAL COSTS
There is also the question of the additional costs the PC unit will have to bear. Analysts noted on Monday that when HP rejected the idea of splitting into two companies in 2011, it estimated such a move would cancel out USD 1 billion in annual savings, chiefly from bulk-buying components, and also mean USD 1.5 billion in one-time startup costs.
The split also means HP's salesforce can no longer cross-sell products to large customers, and could create some confusion.
"If the decision by HP isn’t well communicated or is not well executed, the negative share shifts could be material," said Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes.
HP does have experience in splitting off old businesses. In 1999 it spun off its non-computing operations under the name Agilent, with an initial public offering that raised $2.1 billion.
MacDonald at Gartner said the PC and printing unit can be successful if HP follows the template for a declining printing market.
"HP has gained share and improved margins in a market where the overall number of pages printed has declined," he said. "HP has shown it can handle a market in decline. That's the model that would need to be applied to the traditional Windows PC market."

Former Smashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin last week placed his five-bedroom, 10,646-square-foot mansion in north suburban Riverwoods back on the market for $1.75  million.
Chamberlin, 50, who was with  Smashing Pumpkins from 1988 until 1995 and  2006 until 2009,  most recently was in the  band  Skysaw, which he left in 2012. He  is CEO of Chicago-based social media company LiveOne, which  allows users to view live-streamed entertainment content in a customized social network.
  Open link
Chamberlin paid $1.6 million in 2008 for the mansion, which was built in 2006. He listed it in 2011 for $1.65 million but took it off the market a little over a year later.
The 15-room mansion, set on 1.77 acres,  has five en-suite bedrooms, 6 1/2 baths, a gourmet kitchen, a first-floor bedroom/playroom, Brazilian cherry wood floors throughout, two limestone fireplaces, and a lower level with 11-foot ceilings, a rec room, wine cellar, spa with sauna, an exercise room and a theater.
Chamberlin's previous area homes included one in Long Grove that he bought in 2002 for $832,500 and sold in 2004 for $895,000 to move to California, and one in Lake Bluff that he bought in 1998 for $312,000 and sold in 2002 for $355,000. He also owned a 3,311-square-foot house in Murrieta, Calif., from 2004 until 2008.
Listing agent Randy Michaels of American Capital Realty & Management declined to comment on the listing.
"Gone Girl" novelist Gillian Flynn lists in Ukrainian Village: Last week, "Gone Girl" novelist Gillian Flynn  listed her 10-room vintage Victorian  row home in Ukrainian Village for $769,000, and it has gone under contract.
Flynn, 43, and her lawyer husband, Brett Nolan, are selling because of their growing family, said listing agent Christine Lutz of  Kinzie Real Estate Group. Flynn recently gave birth to the couple's second child, according to a Facebook post.
Major motion pictures based on two of her novels, "Dark Places" and "Gone Girl," are set to be released this fall.

Nifty seen opening flat; may retest 7950 levelsGEPL Capital
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat on Wednesday tracking muted trend seen in other Asian markets . Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to retest its crucial psychological support level of 7,950 in trade today.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 18.50 points lower at 7970 indicating muted opening on the domestic market.
Nifty remained highly volatile throughout the session on Tuesday and despite attempts to edge higher it met with severe selling pressure and concluded the day almost flat at 7964 gaining 5 points.
Though Nifty managed to clear the immediate resistance of 8020, it remained below the next important resistance of 8040. Despite the severe decline of about 100 points in intraday it respected the support of 7920.
"The immediate support for Nifty continues to remain at 7920 and any breach of 7920 would increase the likelihood of further decline till 7840 which is the trend reversal level for the index," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"However, if Nifty manages to respect 7920 as a support and clear the resistance of 8040 as well then we may see further upside till 8090 - 8100," added the report. We continue to recommend a stop loss of 7840 for positional Nifty traders.
Overnight, US stocks ended lower after economic data disappointed. U.S. consumer confidence fell in September for the first time in five months and home prices in July rose less than expected from a year earlier, Reuters reported.
"Continued civil unrest in Hong Kong sapped confidence, while the dollar index was in sight of a four-year high after marking its best quarterly gain in six years," added the report.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 28.32 points, or 0.17 per cent, to 17,042.9, the S&P 500 lost 5.51 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 1,972.29 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.46 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 4,493.39.
Trading in Asia was expected to be more subdued than usual, with China closed for National Day and investors warily monitoring developments in Hong Kong's pro-democracy unrest, added the Reuters report.
Asian shares were trading mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.12 per cent higher at 16,192 and South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.60 per cent lower at 2,008.

Rene Bourque buys $1.5 million house in Chicago.
Montreal Canadiens' Rene Bourque buys $1.5 million Chicago house.
Former Chicago Blackhawks right-wing Rene Bourque, who skates for the Montreal Canadiens, paid $1.5 million for a newly constructed house in the Roscoe Village neighborhood.
"He loves it here. He loves the city," Bourque's sports agent, Ben Hankinson, told Elite Street. "It's a place that he may call home after his playing days."
Bourque, 32, an Alberta, Canada, native, debuted with the Blackhawks in 2005 and played in Chicago for three seasons until he was dealt to the Calgary Flames in 2008.
Bourque already owns property in Chicago. He paid $585,000 in 2006 for a two-bedroom, 2,400-square-foot condo in the Bucktown neighborhood that is available to rent for $3,000 a month. Bourque's rental agent for the condo, Sarah Lagimodiere of @properties, declined to comment.
His latest purchase was a private transaction, so few details are available.

High-priced Winnetka mansion sold to private equity exec: The buyer of the 18-room mansion along Winnetka's lakefront that sold in August for $6.1 million was longtime Chicago private equity executive Joseph Nolan, according to public records.
Nolan spent 20 years with Chicago private equity firm GTCR before leaving to form Wilmette-based Beverly Capital, which operates and invests in middle-market firms.
The transaction is Winnetka's highest-priced residential sale so far in 2014. The mansion was listed for $6 million and went under contract after one day on the market. Because the buyer and seller used the same brokerage agency, it's possible a deal was struck before the property was placed in the multiple listing service.
Paige Dooley of the Hudson Co., who represented Nolan, declined to comment. Nolan did not respond to a request for comment.
The four-bedroom, Nantucket-style house, built in 2002, has 5 1/2 baths, a master suite with a library, five fireplaces, a third-floor gazebo and a lower level with an exercise room, rec room and billiard room. The house sits on about three-quarters of an acre with a private beach.
The seller was a bank trust.
Former Comdisco CEO sells in Park Ridge for $1.2M: John "Jack" Slevin, former CEO of the now-defunct medical equipment refurbisher and disaster recovery firm Comdisco, has sold his 5,203-square-foot, ivy-covered Tudor-style mansion in Park Ridge for $1.2 million.
Slevin, 78, was named CEO of Rosemont-based Comdisco in 1994 after its founder died. He held the post for 4 1/2 years before retiring in early 1999. Comdisco filed for bankruptcy in 2001.
Slevin first listed the four-bedroom mansion for $2 million in August 2013. He cut the price in September 2013 to $1.75 million and then to $1.6 million in January. He reduced the price to $1.45 million in May.
The mansion, built in 1930, has 5 1/2 baths, a slate roof, and a master suite that has been expanded to include a walk-in closet and sitting area. The 0.4-acre property has a pool, an expansive patio and golf course views. Slevin bought the home for an undisclosed amount in late 1991.
"They don't build them like that anymore," said listing agent Danny McGovern of Re/Max Properties Northwest, who also represented the buyer. "It was just all stone and slate and it backs up to a country club."
Slevin also has a home in Naples, Fla. McGovern said he thinks Slevin has decided to live full time in Florida.
Crain's Chicago Business first reported Slevin's sale.

Americans Spending More On Snacks  Less On Actual Real Foodreddit
We're becoming a nation of snackers.
Americans are spending much more on snacks like protein bars, chips and beef jerky, while overall grocery spending has remained almost flat, according to data provided by Nielsen to The Huffington Post. Worldwide, snack sales rose 2 percent to $374 billion for the year ending in March.
The chart below, based on Nielsen data, shows how sales of snacks grew much faster in the U.S. than grocery spending overall during the year ended Sept. 6, 2014.
Why Are We Buying So Many Snacks?
When asked why they're snacking so much, most of the 490 Americans Nielsen polled said they "enjoyed" eating all the time. Because, of course. After enjoyment, the second most common reason Americans cite for eating a snack in the past 30 days is "to satisfy hunger in between meals," Nielsen found.
Of course, the reasons we're snacking all the time go much deeper than "hunger" and "fun":
1. We work a lot: Full-time employees actually work 47 hours a week on average, according to a recent Gallup survey. And millions of workers are juggling multiple jobs .
And family life has gotten more hectic. Over the past few decades, the number of households with two working parents has grown , making June Cleaver-style meals more of a rarity . In addition, kids these days are more likely to grab a Go-Gurt, while racing between swim practices, violin lessons and debate team prep than to sit down for dinner.
2. Big Food brainwashed you (a little) with delicious jerkies and salted chips: Food giants want us to eat processed foods -- the companies can charge more for potato chips than for potatoes. Big Food obsesses over creating super-addictive snack items in the battle for "stomach share," so there are tons of snacks for you to choose from at the store. For example, more than a dozen varieties of Doritos are available.
A comprehensive list of Doritos flavors, according to the Frito-Lay website.
Our need to snack has even changed the way we view certain foods, said James Russo, a senior vice president of consumer insights at Nielsen. Take breakfast cereal. Instead of eating it just for breakfast, we now see items like Kix as more of a snack food. While sales of breakfast cereal are declining overall, an increasing number of us are eating Cheerios throughout the day. Forty-four percent of Americans said they ate cereal outside a meal in the past 30 days, compared to just 19 percent who said they ate a nutrition bar during that time period, according to Nielsen.
"One of the big stories here is the blurring of what is a snack and what is a meal," Russo said.
And the number of snacks we eat at mealtimes is expected to grow by 5 percent over the next five years. That means that in 2018, Americans will be eating snacks as meals 86.4 billion times a year, according to the NPD Group , a market research firm.
NPD predicts most of that growth will come from healthier snacks, but that doesn't mean we're over chocolate and chips. Instead, because we're snacking constantly, we want snacks to be available in both decadent and healthy forms. Pepsi's recent patent for a granola bar with Pop Rocks is one food that combines these desires, but for the most part we're looking to eat carrots and hummus around lunchtime and then grab some candy a few hours later.
Russo pointed to Americans' contradictory feelings toward salt as an example of this dynamic. While the top snack in North America over the past 30 days was chips or crisps, the third-highest health priority for respondents was low salt/sodium, Nielsen found .
"We want indulgent snacks but we also want healthy options for a snack," Russo said. "We're increasingly using all these different food products to satisfy our hunger."

Marussia Formula One driver Jules Bianchi of France drives during the Japanese F1 …
By Abhishek Takle
SUZUKA Japan (Reuters) - French Formula One driver Jules Bianchi has suffered severe head injuries and is undergoing surgery after a crash that cast a pall over Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix.
The unconscious Marussia driver had been taken by road ambulance to Mie General Hospital near the Suzuka circuit after the accident that brought out red flags and led to the race being stopped early.
"The CT scan shows that he has suffered a severe head injury and is currently undergoing surgery," the governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) said in an update on his condition.
"Following this he will be moved to intensive care where he will be monitored.
Bianchi, a graduate of Ferrari's young driver academy, is seen as an up-and-coming talent in Formula One after scoring Marussia's first ever points when he finished ninth at this year's Monaco Grand Prix.
The accident occurred at the same point of the track, the Dunlop Curve, where Adrian Sutil had aquaplaned off a lap earlier and involved a tractor that was lifting the stricken Sauber.
The FIA confirmed Bianchi had hit the back of the recovery vehicle as he skidded off.
The crash brought out the safety and medical cars and led to the race, already threatened by the advancing Typhoon Phanfone, being red flagged and not re-started with the result declared after 44 of the 53 scheduled laps.
There were no podium celebrations and the champagne was left unsprayed, with the top three drivers merely clinking the bottles before putting them back on the ground.
DRIVER CONCERN
"It's obviously a real anti-climax to hear that one of our fellow colleagues is seriously injured so that's really the main worry," Mercedes' race winner Lewis Hamilton told the BBC.
"You could see some commotion and the car was really badly damaged on the right. We just hope he's OK."
"I'm not thinking about the race, I'm thinking about my colleague," said the Briton's second placed team mate Nico Rosberg. "I've been given some information and it seems very, very serious. I'm hoping for the best."
McLaren's Jenson Button, who finished fifth, said it was "an accident that you hope never happens in Formula One".
Bianchi is a regular travelling companion of Ferrari's double world champion Fernando Alonso and popular with other ddrivers, with whom he often plays soccer.
Formula One is proud of its safety record, and constantly strives to make cars safer, while remaining acutely aware that the sport will always be dangerous.
"Motor-racing is dangerous. We get used to it if nothing happens and then suddenly we are all surprised," former champion Niki Lauda, who came back from a near fatal crash in 1976, told reporters.
The death of Brazilian triple world champion Ayrton Senna, in 1994, remains the last driver race fatality but there have been close escapes since then.
Marussia's former test driver Maria De Villota, who died last year, lost her right eye and fractured her skull when the Spaniard's car accelerated into the back of a parked team truck at a 2012 test in England.
Brazilian Felipe Massa suffered life-threatening head injuries in Hungary in 2009 when he was hit on the helmet by a bouncing spring shed from the car of compatriot Rubens Barrichello.
Massa made a full recovery from that incident and was racing for Williams on Sunday. Media reports said the Brazilian went with other drivers and team officials to the hospital.

A businessman who proclaims himself leader of the Indonesian chapter of the Islamic State group says he has personally overseen the departure of scores of fighters from this Southeast Asian nation to Syria and Iraq. Police detained him for a night recently, but were unable to charge him with a crime.
Chep Hernawan reflects both the success IS has had in attracting support in the region, and the challenges Indonesia faces in responding.

The government, home to most of the up to 200 Southeast Asians believed to be fighting in Syria and Iraq, has forcefully spoken out against the Islamic State, as have mainstream Muslim organizations in the country. But translating that into stronger legal tools that could stop suspected militants from traveling abroad, for example, will be a challenge given the fractious nature of the next parliament and other legislative priorities, according to a recent report into the evolution of the Islamic State group by the Institute of Policy Analysis for Conflict.
National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Boy Rafli Amar said his force could only monitor IS supporters.
“If they have no record of terrorism activities then they can’t be charged under our criminal law,” he said.

For the first time since the 1990s and the Afghan jihad, Indonesians, Malaysians and other extremists in Southeast Asia are traveling abroad in an organized fashion to join a global militant movement, picking up battlefield skills and militant contacts.
Security officials fear they could take part in terrorism on their return to Southeast Asia, as those trained in Afghanistan did in attacks such as the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people. Radicals at home also could heed the Islamic State group’s exhortations to carry out revenge attacks on Western targets.

US chants NaMo mantra post Modi s visitUS chants NaMo mantra post PM Modi's visit
Arun Kumar     Washington   Last Updated: October 10, 2014  | 13:36 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Photo: Reuters)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dressed for the occasion wherever he went, but the diverse colours that he donned on his recent visit to the United States had one unifying theme - to win America. And this is being talked about even a week after his visit.
And win America Modi did even before he reached Washington for a much awaited summit with US President Barack Obama after wowing the Indian diaspora, sharing the stage with top American music stars to reach out to America's liberal youth and wooing the big business in the Big Apple.
FULL COVERAGE: PM Narendra Modi in US
It was a surprise performance from a once provincial leader with little foreign policy experience who came to power just four months ago though with a historic win in the elections giving his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a clear mandate for the first time in 30 years.
Landing in the financial capital of the US in a smart casual maroon bandhgala and black pants, he got out of his car in front of his hotel to shake hands with delighted members of the Indian-American community chanting "Modi Modi" as anxious security guys scrambled to keep their charge safe.
Then he switched to a more formal bandhgala suit for meetings with the city's mayor and a Nobel Laureate cancer researcher. That was to be the pattern of the Prime Minister's 100-hour action-packed whirlwind tour laced with symbolism.
Next day wearing his trade mark half sleeve Modi kurta and churidars with a grey shawl thrown on his left shoulder, he paid homage at Ground Zero where the twin towers of the World Trade Centre stood before the 9/11 attack, to show the country's resolve to fight terrorism and solidarity with Americans.
Switching to a formal blue bandhgala suit, Modi then took to the world stage with an address to the UN General Assembly choosing to speak in Hindi, the country's official language (the other being English).
And instead of mouthing clichÃ© ridden paeans to non-alignment he gave a call to form a 'G-all' in today's interdependent world. Yet he also chided Pakistan for raking up Kashmir at the UN and offered to engage in a "serious bilateral dialogue", but "without the shadow of terrorism".
In the evening, he outlined his vision of a 'Clean India' to a 65,000-strong youthful crowd at New York's Central Park addressing them in an idiom they understood saying "I salute you" and "May the force be with you" from the evergreen hit Star Wars films.
A capacity crowd of nearly 20,000 star struck Indian-American gave him a rock star like welcome at the Madison Square Garden as he spoke to them in Hindi in his chatty style for over an hour as thousands more heard him on jumbotron screens at Times Square and in homes across the US.
Then packing meetings with two governors, including South Carolina's Indian-American Nikki Haley, 40 odd lawmakers, 11 CEOs and an address to the Council on Foreign Relations, again in Hindi, the Prime Minister headed to Washington.
An Indian-American writer suggested that Modi through his fast for the Hindu festival of Navratri and the choice of his apparel was speaking in code his "Hindu nationalist" supporters, while another implied that he was cocking a snook to the American establishment that had denied him a visa for nearly a decade.
Be as it may, the US officialdom from Obama also treated Modi no less as they broke the ice over an exclusive dinner at the White House. As they shared common experiences, the US President wondered how Modi kept up such a rigorous schedule on just a diet of warm water and yoga and told him how he himself enjoyed dancing during his 2010 trip to India.
So much so that as the summit ended with the two leaders giving a new mantra of "chalein saath saath - together we go forward," Obama joined Modi on an unscheduled trip to the memorial of African-American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
Modi had come full circle in just four short months. There lay the true significance of the Modi visit though some critics dismissed their joint statement vowing to deepen cooperation in from defence to nuclear to space to counter-terrorism to women's empowerment and health as merely a rehashed 'laundry list'.
What PM Modi himself has called a " hugely successful " and US officials branded as an "extraordinarily successful" journey was different from others before in more ways than just optics: the two sides have lined up a "pretty ambitious agenda of engagement" over the next nine months or so to translate words into action.

NATO wants constructive relations with Russia: Jens StoltenbergPolish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz welcomes NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, left, before talks in Warsaw, Poland, Monday, Oct. 6, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Warsaw | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:55 pm
NATO wants constructive relations with Russia even as it increases its presence in its member states in eastern Europe, the alliance’s new secretary-general told a Polish newspaper on Monday.
Jens Stoltenberg, who is visiting Poland, said NATO would still respect its international commitments, which include a post-Cold War deal with Moscow about Western military deployments in former members of the old Soviet bloc.
“There is no contradiction between a strong NATO and building constructive relations with Russia,” Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister who took up his new job last week, told the Gazeta Wyborcza daily in an interview.
“That stems from my political experience. Norway is a small country that neighbours Russia, yet despite that, probably even in the coldest periods of the Cold War, we were able to cooperate on questions of energy, fisheries and demarcation of maritime borders,” he was quoted as saying.

Relations between Moscow and the NATO alliance are at a post-Cold War low over Russia’s actions in Ukraine, where it annexed the Crimean peninsula in March and has been supporting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. “We are strengthening our security without violating NATO’s international commitments,” Stoltenberg said of the alliance’s increased presence in Poland and the Baltic states.
Aiming to reassure allies near Russia’s border, the alliance has adopted a plan to create a “spearhead” rapid reaction force and pre-position supplies and equipment in east European countries so they can be reinforced within days in a crisis.

To speed up land transfer to successful bidders
New Delhi, October 6:  
Under pressure to come up with a fool-proof system for allocation of coal blocks, the Coal Ministry plans to amend the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act.
This is expected to enable quick transfer of land held by Coal India to successful bidders.
The Ministry has floated a Cabinet note to transfer surface rights of land held by the public sector miner to the awardees.
According to the proposal mooted by the Coal Ministry, the land transfer would be through a conveyance deed on terms agreed between the winner and Coal India.
It further suggests that the mineral rights will be deemed to be with the State Government which shall grant mining lease to the successful player.
Regarding the terms agreed upon for land transfer, the proposal also stipulates that it will include the cost incurred by Coal India, money spent on rehabilitation and resettlement, and acquisition of the land.
The Coal Ministry is of the opinion that such a move will ensure distribution of natural resources in a fair and transparent manner within the ambit of the existing law.
The note has been circulated to the Ministry of Power, Ministry of Mines, Department of Land Resources, Department of Expenditure, Department of Economic Affairs, Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Steel, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion and the Planning Commission. Comments on the note are still awaited.

EU frowns at Indias telecom sourcing rulesEU frowns at India’s telecom sourcing rules
Amiti Sen
Seeks clarity on value addition for a product to qualify as locally made
New Delhi, October 6:  
The European Union has raised concerns about India’s domestic sourcing norms for purchase of telecommunication products by Government departments and has asked for clarification on how much value addition needs to be done in the country for such items to qualify as locally manufactured.
Only for Govt purchases
Although India partially relaxed its policy to give preference to domestically manufactured electronic and telecom products by restricting them only to Government purchases and exempting the private sector in December last year, the EU is not happy.
In a representation made to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the EU said that it was concerned about India pursuing the policy of local content requirements in various industrial sectors.
New Delhi, however, maintains that its policy on compulsory sourcing of at least 30 per cent of electronic and telecom products by Government Ministries and Departments was in strict compliance with WTO norms. Whatever clarifications it would give to other members on the matter would be strictly on a voluntary basis.
“We have changed our preference policy for domestic manufacturers in the electronics sector by restricting it to Government purchases after several WTO members including the US and the EU protested. What more do they want?” a Government official told BusinessLine.
“The EU wants us to spell out in greater details how we classify domestic production. Basically it wants to assess what part of its exports could take a hit because of the domestic sourcing condition and what would pass muster because of adequate domestic value addition,” the official said.
Since India is not a signatory to the WTO agreement on Government Procurement, its policies related to purchases made by the Government does not fall within the WTO’s ambit.
Electronic products (at about $ 31 billion in 2013-14) are the second-largest component in India’s import basket and the country wants to reduce its dependence on foreign products by encouraging local production.
The notification issued by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology in December 2013 has left it mostly to individual Departments and Ministries to specify local value addition requirements that a product should satisfy for it to qualify as domestically manufactured electronic product.
It has, however, specified the minimum levels of domestic value addition, ranging from 25 per cent in the first year of production to 45 per cent in the fifth year of production.

Why Gold  Crude Prices Have Hit Multi-Year LowsGovernment to Streamline Subsidies, Cheap LPG for Rich May Go: Finance Minister
Precious metals seem to have joined the global downturn in commodity prices, with gold tumbling to its lowest level in 15 months on Monday. The fall in commodity prices augurs well for the Indian economy and for also for corporate earnings.
Here are 10 things to know about the fall in commodity prices,
1) Cash Gold hit $1183.46 an ounce today, its weakest since June 2013. Other precious metals also fell tracking weak gold prices. Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low. ( Read the full story here )
2) Gold prices fell mainly because of rising dollar. The US dollar has hit over four-year high against a basket of currencies. Commodities are priced in dollars, so when the dollar rises, more of it are needed to buy the same commodity. This hits demand and consequently hurts commodity prices.
3) The dollar has been rising on hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon start raising interest rates because of improving economic data in the US. A rate hike will lead to inward flow of funds into the US, strengthening the greenback.
4) Gold is not the only commodity under pressure. At $92/barrel, Brent prices are trading at their lowest in 27 months. Brent crude has been under pressure because of oversupply and weak demand in EU and China. It has now entered into bear territory after falling by more than 20 per cent since June. ( Read )
5) Global coal prices have also taken a hit, with coal trading around $70/ton after coming off sharply from US$100/ton 30 months ago. The prolonged slump is mainly due to declining demand of imported coal from China, which plays a dominant role in the overall international trade of the commodity, domestic brokerage Kotak says.
6) Prices of agricultural commodities such as sugar, wheat, tea and coffee have also fallen. Global sugar prices have slipped to 4-year low due to higher yields in Brazil and higher global stocks, Kotak says.
7) Among metals, aluminium prices have come under pressure after a rally. Iron ore prices are down by 40 per cent since December 2013 because of slowdown in China's steel consumption. ( Read )
8) India will be a key beneficiary of the fall in global commodity prices. Kotak says Brent prices may remain in a range of $90-$105/barrel over the medium term and this will offset inflationary pressures and reduce India's current account deficit and fiscal deficit. India's CAD comes down by $1.1 billion if Brent falls by $1/barrel, Kotak estimated.
9) Lower crude prices will also help support the rupee, which is likely to come under pressure once bond yields start to rise in the US. ( Read )
10) Softer prices of agricultural products and oil derivatives, which serve as raw materials for consumer companies, will result in an improvement in gross margins of consumer staples companies, Kotak says. For energy companies, overall under-recoveries will come down meaningfully. The benefit to companies will be clear when the government implements a more reasonable subsidy-sharing system, Kotak added.

Srinagar: In its third ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC) in less than 24 hours, Pakistani troops fired at Indian posts in Jammu's Akhnoor and Rajouri sectors, continuing their firing at Jammu's Arnia sector and Poonch's Bhimber Gali and Shahpur sectors.
Arnia is where the Pakistan Rangers have been firing since Sunday night, killing five civilians and injuring 34 by Monday morning.

"There are more casualties on the Pakistani side, according to their own media reports," Director General of the Border Security Force, DK Pathak said. "Since the new government took charge, we are at liberty to respond as the situation demands," he told CNN-IBN.
In New Delhi, Defence Minister Arun Jaitley deplored the ceasefire violations from across the border and said the Indian armed forces were "fully ready" and are responding to each of these provocations from across the border.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, "Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations now and understand the reality that times have changed in India."
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who flew to Jammu immediately after his Eid prayers in Srinagar, strongly condemned the shelling on civilians, saying targeting them exposed the frustration of the Pakistani government after its failure to gain international attention on the Kashmir issue.
"They (the Pakistani leadership) have nothing else to speak, but only Kashmir. Whenever they go abroad, they try to raise only Kashmir issue, but every time they miserably fail to get international attention. The cross-border shelling is an indication of their frustration," he told reporters after meeting civilians injured in the shelling at the Government Medical College Hospital in Srinagar.
Omar attended cremation of those killed in Arnia and also visited the village which came under heavy Pakistani shelling in the wee hours on Monday.
The Chief Minister said he will brief Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the situation in the wake of frequent ceasefire violations by Pakistan.
There were some reports of people moving out of the affected areas, fearing fresh attacks.
The Pakistani troops used small, automatic weapons and mortar bombs to target the border hamlets and BoPs. 29 of the injured have been shifted to GMC hospital in Jammu. Three others were brought dead, Chief Medical officer of the hospital Dr Ritesh Shan said.
"We have always been the sitting ducks on fire. The Pakistani side always attack the civilians in the area and we become the worst sufferers," said 70-year-old Bira Devi.
A large number of houses were damaged and livestock perished in the firing and shelling, said Devender Singh, who was leading a team that shifted the injured people to hospital during the heavy shelling.
"People living in critical zones along the border will be evacuated," he said.
The BSF spokesman said that the force did not suffer any casualty.
Congress and BJP said the ceasefire violations by Pakistan were a "serious" issue and it should desist from such activities.
"Whatever Pakistan is doing is certainly a serious matter. And we want to tell Pakistan that indulging in such activities is not good for that country," BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.
Condemning Pakistan's actions, former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. "There cannot be anything worse than this," the Congress leader said. Party leader and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, however, asked why Modi government was "keeping silent".
"It's most unfortunate that firing is going on from Pakistan side in Jammu and Kashmir and at this juncture any firing from across the border is very very critical. It's most unfortunate that the Government is also keeping silent," he said.
There have been a dozen ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during the last six days.
On October 4, Pakistani troops resorted to firing and mortar shelling along LoC in Poonch district, drawing retaliation from Army.
On October 3, Pakistani troops and rangers violated ceasefire in Gulmarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch in which a girl was killed and six persons injured.
On October 1 and 2, Pakistani troops violated ceasefire two times along LoC in Poonch district resulting in injuries to six people, including three women.

Why farmers inclusion is necessary in warehousingWhy farmers’ inclusion is necessary in warehousing
MS JAIRATH
Tweet
October 6, 2014:  
Advent in technology and its dissemination, government’s priority to the sector and increasing responsibility due to ever increasing population, Indian agriculture has grown considerably over the years. With this development, increasing infrastructure requirements have always been concern of every government. Though the sector has always been given priority status, a remarkable change in the life of Indian peasant (especially small and marginal) is yet to witness. Many reasons can be assigned for the ill development of Indian farmers, but the most important which one can identify is farmer’s inability to make use of time advantage of its produce. Most of the farmers grow the crop, harvest and sells quickly without waiting for favourable market condition. Perhaps farmers knows that the prices of their produce goes up after a period of time, the urgency of cash need forces them to sell the produce at an unfavourable price.
Knowing this as well as promotion of scientific storage in the country, Government of India started Grameen Bhandaran Yojana, a special scheme for rural India. Over the years, the scheme resulted in building a storage capacity of more than 54.2 million MT in rural areas. Though the increase in storage capacity was much needed and still there is need of promoting warehousing in the country, parallel to this, Farmers Inclusionin storage should also be ensured.
Establishment of WDRA and changing Role of Banks
Banks are the major role player in fulfilling the objectives of the government by providing pledge loan to farmers against the produce stored in the godown/ warehouse. Even with continuous efforts by government, pledge loan against warehouse receipt has not been much popularized in India as the bankers are not confident with management and maintenance of the warehouses in the country, reported by Working Group on Warehousing under 10th Five Year Plan. With the aim of regulating and promoting the growth of warehousing in India and also to introduce the negotiability of warehouse receipts by launching Negotiable Warehouse Receipt System (NWRS), Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) was established by enacting Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act 2007. The Act came into force from 25th October 2010.For the purpose of building confidence of different stakeholders over warehouses, WDRA has defined norms for construction and operation of warehouses. The Warehouse Service Providers (WSPs) have to ensure compliance with the norms defined for accreditation of warehouses with the Authority.
Growth in pledge finance
In Indian agricultural scenario pledge finance has immense importance as most of the farmers hold small or medium sized land and thus lack financial backup. Most of these farmers do not possess any collateral which can be offered to financial institutions for availing a loan. Negotiable Warehouse Receipts are now being used as collateral. Thus in many Indian states, pledge finance has been growing in recent past. Among the 28 Indian states, only 12 have made headway for spreading pledge finance among farmers and other stakeholders dealing in agricultural commodities. Pledge finance has become popular in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. On after establishment of WDRA, in most of the state growth in availing pledge finance has been observed except Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. The highest growth was recorded in Gujarat (62%) followed by Orissa (49%) and Punjab (27%). The states of West Bengal, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Haryana have witnessed a growth of less than 10 per cent.
This has been possible in these states with the concerted efforts put forth by agencies such as Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), State Warehousing Corporation (SWC), State Agricultural Marketing Departments/ Boards, Collateral Management Service provider i.e. National Collateral Management Service Limited and National Bulk Handling Corporation (NBHC).
In the remaining states where the pledge finance scheme has been prevalent, but to gain momentum, awareness camp on mass scale is needed for reaching the producer growers.
Farmers Inclusion
In order to bring prosperity in the life of producer growers, it is the duty of government to ensure Farmers Inclusion in all agriculture related schemes. A primary investigation into the matter reveals that most of the farmers do not store the produce in warehouses as they need cash quickly after harvesting the crop. Lack of awareness about the pledge loan scheme and utilization of NWR is also among the reasons that the farmers are not landing to warehouses. The investigation also revealed that unwillingness of bankers due to risk involved in sanctioning loan against NWR has also become a hurdle in promotion of such scheme. The bankers though are aware about accreditation norms of WDRA, still hesitate as many risks associated with warehousing, which are to be mandatorily insured.
Risk Mitigation
The norms of accreditation by WDRA address the issue by including mandatory insurance by the WSPs. As per the direction of WDRA, the insurance policy covers a) Insurance of items stored b) Fire and Perils c) Earthquake, spontaneous combustion and d) Fidelity and personal indemnity. Though these are the major risk factors associated with warehouses, factors which are yet to include to increase bankers confidence are a) Insurance against price fluctuation b) Loss in quality of stored item due to climatic factors c) fidelity by temporary wagers and d)Bankruptcy of WSPs. Apart from this, another lacuna in the insurance coverage is that in cases of terrorism / burglary / misappropriation / theft etc. the insurance coverage is only 20% of the value of goods. If these risk factors are addressed properly, bankers may come in comfort zone, which will result in promotion of pledge finance and Farmers Inclusion in warehousing.

AIG Bailout Designed to Be PunishmentAdministration's Mixed Message on Iraqi Aid
Oct. 23, 2006
This weekend, President Bush held a series of meetings with top advisers to discuss the strategy in Iraq as violence pushed the death toll for U.S. troops to 85 for October -- making this month the deadliest this year.
The White House has said the administration's goal is to get the Iraqi government to take control of its country and stop the sectarian violence.
The top commanders in Iraq said that the United States needed to set benchmarks for the Iraqi government.
The question, however, is how do you enforce those benchmarks?
Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, told ABC News today that "incentives" were key to getting Iraq on the path to self-governance, and he indicated those could be monetary incentives.
"Well, in some situations, we do have a lot of reconstruction funds, for example," Bartlett said today on "Good Morning America."
"If you have a solid political structure in place and a security climate, that way you can have money go into there. … There are a lot of ways to move them along the path, and that's something we're working on."
Later this morning, White House spokesman Tony Snow seemed to contradict Bartlett and shot down talk of monetary incentives.
"There is nothing new. He's not saying there is something new," Snow said. "That's the important thing is this is a continuation of a process. ... And this is an ongoing process. And the notion that something dramatic has changed, it's just not the case."
Snow said that the Iraqis already had an incentive to meet their benchmarks -- that's their natural desire to live a better life.
'Spinning Out of Control'
Bartlett also said that if U.S. generals asked for more troops, "They'll get them."
"Every time the president has been asked whether they need more troops or less troops, they have gotten the request," Bartlett said.
"The most recent conversations the president has had with the generals, they have not asked for more troops. But President Bush has made clear if they want them, they'll get them."
Gen. Jack Keane, former Army vice chief of staff and an ABC News consultant, said it was clear the situation in Iraq was "spinning out of control."
"The chairman of joint chiefs announced that he's put together a group, hand-selected officers brought to the Pentagon from different parts of the world to reassess the strategy, and certainly, troops and resources have got to be on the table," he said.
In his opinion, Keane said, more troops are necessary to stop the sectarian violence.
"We've not been able to stop the violence. That is a hard reality that we're dealing with," he said.

On technology front  India  China are on the same page: Claudio FacchinOn technology front, India, China are on the same page: Claudio Facchin
Jyoti Mukul |  Oct 07, 2014 12:49 AM IST
The fragility of India's power systems became evident in 2012 when power grids collapsed for two consecutive days. Since then, the country has not only been trying to strengthen its transmission systems, but is also witnessing new technology make its way into the domestic market. During a recent visit here, Claudio Facchin, global head (power systems division) at ABB, spoke to Jyoti Mukul on the importance of India market in his company's portfolio. Edited excerpts:
How has the demand from the Indian market changed in terms of technology?
In power systems overall, we see quite a dynamic market across the regions and India is part of this. There are a number of changes that are coming in not just in generation but transmission and distribution as well, leading to increased complexity of managing grid. The much higher penetration of renewables, which we saw in Europe, is coming in China, Brazil and India. The unpredictability of renewable energy creates the need to manage the grid. There is also the need to reduce losses, consumption and environmental impact. Smart grid has to match all this real-time with the demand.
There is talk of smart city, but before you have smart city, you need to have a smart grid. ABB is offering its entire portfolio right from software to the higher end of technology such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) execution, substation controls and automation.
Since you have watched the China market carefully, how would you compare India's needs to those of China?
Everybody thinks things are very different in China, but the drivers are similar in the two markets. The one point which is same is the focus on technology. In China, they are focusing on the best available technology and I see that in India, too. It is important that we nurture that need even more here since it will also allow a lot of things in infrastructure to leapfrog. The more leeway technology at the high-end gets, the more returns will be ensured on investment. So far, India and China are the only two countries that have HVDC technology under application. We see that coming in Brazil, too. In some instances, China is a bit ahead in certain areas like in 800 kilovolts. However, soon we will see it in India too. Vice-versa, India is going ahead on the alternating current (AC) side. The reason why India is a key market is because of the approach of customers. They look at the systems rather than just a specific equipment. We have been able to deliver technology in a competitive way.
How big is the India market in your global portfolio?
Of the $8-billion revenue from power systems, $400 million comes from here - which is about five per cent. India is among the largest single market for power systems. We took a decision to build capacity in India for the local market, but also found a fertile opportunity to build our capacity mainly in engineering side to support our business outside the country. In Chennai, for instance, 500 engineers are dedicated to support our projects in other parts of the world. Besides, 15 per cent of ABB India's revenue comes from exports and for power systems, it is 18-20 per cent of the revenue.
Haven't the problems in the power sector over the past few years impacted your company?
We are less exposed to power generation; we work in transmission and distribution and for industry. We can support with the breadth of our portfolio and experience of markets, which went through the same experience. We have done a lot of renewables. We have used the slowdown here as an opportunity to feed the neighbouring countries.
Do you see a resurgence in the power sector with the coming of a new government at the Centre?
On the soft side, there is a lot of motivation and good will. On the hard side, there have been changes in the past five years. There is a good momentum in infrastructure building. There is even more push for implementation. There has always been strong planning in this market. Implementation was not always following through as expected, but now I also see that gap is closing and there is positive momentum from that aspect. We are looking forward to momentum picking up in projects.

Here s What The Supreme Court Is Up To This TermHere's What The Supreme Court Is Up To This Term
 | By                                                                The Associated Press
reddit
A look at some of the noteworthy cases the Supreme Court will hear this term, which begins Monday:
—Mistaken traffic stop: A broken brake light led a North Carolina police officer to pull over a car in which cocaine was later found. Turns out, the state requires only one functioning brake light. The court is weighing a case about whether a defendant's constitutional protection against unreasonable searches was violated because of the officer's mistaken understanding of the law.
—Prison beards: An Arkansas inmate is challenging a prison policy that prevents him from growing a short beard in accordance with his Muslim religious beliefs. Prison officials say the policy prevents inmates from concealing contraband or quickly changing their appearance in an escape.
—Teeth whitening: The North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners is challenging a Federal Trade Commission order that said the dentist-filled board is trying to kill off competition from day spas and tanning booths that offer teeth-whitening.
—Dishonest juror: Claims that a juror's comments during trial deliberations over a South Dakota traffic accident raise questions about her impartiality and possibly could result in a new trial.
—Born in Jerusalem: The case of an American born in Jerusalem who wants his passport to list his birthplace as Israel underlies a major dispute between Congress and the president, with Middle Eastern politics as the backdrop. The United States has never recognized any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem, believing the city's status should be resolved in peace negotiations. The administration says a 2002 law passed by Congress allowing Israel to be listed as the birthplace of Jerusalem-born Americans would in essence be seen as a U.S. endorsement of Israeli control of the city.
—Alabama redistricting: Democrats and black lawmakers contend that Republican leaders in Alabama drew a new legislative map that illegally packed black voters into too few voting districts to limit minority political power. Republicans say they complied with the law by keeping the same number of districts in which black voters could elect candidates of their choice.
— Facebook threats: A Pennsylvania man challenges his conviction for making threats on Facebook. He says his online rants about killing his estranged wife, shooting up a school and slitting an FBI agent's throat were simply rap lyrics, and that he didn't mean to threaten anyone.
— Pregnancy discrimination: A United Parcel Service employee says the company failed to accommodate her pregnancy when it refused to give her light-duty work. But UPS contends its policies are "pregnancy-neutral," allowing light-duty assignments only in cases where employees are injured on the job or have certain medical conditions.
—Housing discrimination: For the third time, the court has agreed to hear a challenge from Texas to an important tool the government is increasingly using to fight discrimination in housing. Two earlier cases settled before the justices could weigh in on the legality of determining discrimination from the results of a policy that disproportionately affects minorities, rather than by showing any intent to discriminate.
—Religious discrimination: Retailer Abercrombie and Fitch is defending its denial of a job to a woman wearing a Muslim headscarf by arguing that she did not say during her interview that she wears the hijab for religious reasons.
___
Cases the justices could decide to hear before the term ends in late June:
—Gay marriage:  Both sides want the justices to settle the question of whether same-sex couples have the same right to marry as heterosexuals under the Constitution. A court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage would grant marriage rights to same-sex couples in all 50 states, up from 19 states and the District of Columbia. A decision in favor of state marriage bans would allow states to continue setting the rules on whether to allow same-sex couples to wed.
—Abortion: Several states have passed laws in recent years aimed at limiting abortion by imposing hospital admitting privilege requirements on doctors who perform abortions, forcing abortion clinic facilities to meet tougher standards and preventing doctors from prescribing pills for medical abortions later in a pregnancy and at a lower dose. The court could take one or more cases that are winding through the courts.
—Voting disputes: Identification requirements and limits on early voting are among state voting laws that could make their way to the Supreme Court this term. The court already has jumped preliminarily into a case over early voting in Ohio and seems likely to want a full-blown review. But a decision on hearing that case could come late enough in the term to push back the argument and decision to the following term that begins a year from now.
—Contraception: The next fight over the new health care law's requirement that contraception be offered to women among a range of preventive services at no extra cost concerns the responsibilities of religious not-for-profit universities, hospitals and other institutions. The Obama administration already allows those organizations to shift responsibility for coverage to their insurers, but the groups say that so-called accommodation still is a burden on their religious consciences. In June, the justices said family-owned corporations with religious objections do not have to pay for contraceptives for women covered under their health plans.
—Health care subsidies: Legal challenges to the health care law continue in several states that would drastically reduce the number of Americans eligible for subsidies to make health insurance affordable. One appeal of a court ruling denying a challenge to the subsidies already is pending at the Supreme Court, although the pace of the other cases suggests the justices are more likely to wait, if they even are willing to undertake another high-stakes fight over the health care law.
—Affirmative action: The court could get another crack at the University of Texas admissions policy that takes race into account among many factors in filling some seats in entering freshmen classes. Lower courts upheld the Texas policy following a Supreme Court decision in 2013 that ordered a new review. The case currently is being appealed to the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

Asian Shares Edge Up, Dollar Steadies After Drop
Reuters | Updated On: October 07, 2014 07:24 (IST)
Gold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
Tokyo:
Asian shares tentatively rose in early trade on Tuesday, while the dollar steadied after investors locked in some gains overnight on its recent rally.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 per cent in early trade, shrugging off a choppy, losing session on Wall Street overnight.
Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped 0.3 per cent ahead of the outcome of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting later in the session.
The BOJ is widely expected to maintain its massive monetary stimulus programme and offer a bleaker view on factory output, after signs Japan's economy was hit harder than expected by a national sales tax increase in April.
"We expect the BOJ to keep monetary policy on hold, but it could lower its economic assessment to reflect continuing data weakness" since the tax hike, strategists at Barclays said in a note to clients.
Against the yen, the dollar edged up about 0.1 per cent to 108.91 yen, pulling away from an overnight low of 108.65 but still well shy of a six-year peak of 110.09 yen marked last week.
The euro inched down 0.1 per cent on the day to $1.2645 but held well above a more than two-year low of $1.2501 set on Friday, after the US non-farm payrolls report fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates by mid-2015.
Investors had a muted reaction to Monday's disappointing report on German industrial orders, which fell 5.7 per cent in August to mark their biggest monthly drop since 2009.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, slipped 0.2 per cent to 85.795 after marking its biggest one-day fall since July 2013. The index rose to a four-year high of 86.746 on Friday, and logged a record 12 straight weeks of gains in which it rose about 7.7 per cent.
The Australian dollar added about 0.1 per cent to $0.8766, pulling away from Friday's low of $0.8642 which was its lowest level since July 2010.
Investors will be watching to see if the Reserve Bank of Australia tries to talk its currency even lower at its regular policy review on Tuesday, at which it is widely expected to hold its cash rate steady at 2.5 per cent. The RBA will announce its decision at 0330 GMT.
The dollar's overnight weakness helped put a floor under recently slumping crude prices. Brent was steady on the day at $92.78 a barrel.
Gold also steadied at $1,205.90 an ounce. In a volatile session on Monday, it marked its biggest one-day gain in two months, after first bumping to a 15-month low.

Namesakes galore in HaryanapollsNamesakes galore in Haryana polls

Raj Singh Mor, INLD candidate from Narnaud, faces a strange predicament. He is contesting against Captain Abhimanyu of the BJP as well as three independent candidates with the name Raj Singh. While two of the Raj Singhs are farmers, another claims to be in private service.
Like Raj Singh Mor, who is a retired IPS officer, there are several candidates from different parties in the fray who have their namesakes contesting as independents. Leaders said that due to similar names, confusion among voters is likely to lead to loss of votes. There have been instances in the past where namesakes have led to loss of a few hundred to several thousand votes. In areas where the contest is close, this could clinch the election results for many candidates.
Raj Singh, son of Bhale Ram, states that the Hooda government has done nothing. He says he has been raising the issue of lack of water supply to villages. To avoid confusion over the similar names, wherever he campaigns, the name of his village is announced, he added.
Another Raj Singh, son of Prem Singh, says he knows he will not win. However, he wants to raise certain issues like corruption and lack of basic amenities which he feels will get noticed when he campaigns. He admits that no party would have given him a ticket, so he is contesting as an independent.
In Sonepat constituency, where Kavita Jain is the BJP contestant, there are two independent candidates named Kavita in the fray. As per their affidavits, both are in private service.
Jain, who is the sitting MLA from the constituency, says it is a cheap ploy used by the opposition parties to cut into her votes. “However, people of the constituency are not fools. They can see through the tricks of the opposition. We will win the election by a thumping margin. Modiji is coming to campaign here on Wednesday. The BJP will surely have its CM in Haryana this time, which will ensure development of the state,” she says.
Against BJP candidate Kanwar Pal, his namesake is contesting as an independent candidate. In Hisar, BJP candidate Dr Kamal Gupta will face another Dr Kamal Gupta. In Sohna constituency, Congress candidate Rohtash Bedi is faced with two independent candidates Rohtash Khatana and Rohtash Singh.

Rajnath Singh at the Farrukhnagar rally on Monday.
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday kickstarted the BJP campaign in the high-profile district of Gurgaon ahead of Assembly elections on October 15.
The former BJP president, who was projected as a “messiah of farmers and son of a farmer”, held a rally for farmers of Farrukhnagar, a neglected block of Badshahpur constituency in Gurgaon district.
“Today, the sons of farmers are willing to work even as watchmen, or take up any odd job in the city, but are not interested in working as farmers. (To solve this) We can promote small scale industry and set up units here for industries such as food processing so that not only farmers get the right price for their produce but local youth also get employment,” he said. “We can set up a unit of manufacturing chips in the village so that potatoes grown locally can be used by the industry directly, without losing margins to middlemen.”
At the rally, which was attended by more than 1,000 people, Rajnath invoked the might of the central leadership which is “trying to make its presence felt across  the world”.
Canvassing for Rao Narbir, BJP candidate from Badshahpur, Rajnath said, “Dilli mein election jitwake, aapne kurta tho pehna diya; ab Haryana mein jitwake pyjama pehna do.”
Rao Narbir’s grandfather and father were politicians and represented their constituencies many times. Rao also became the youngest cabinet minister in Haryana in 1987, in the Devi Lal government. Often criticised for party-hopping, Narbir seeks to garner Ahir support and benefit from a pro-BJP wave in the area.

Two time BMC corporator and daughter of gangster-turned-politician Arun Gulab Ahir, Geeta Gawli will be contesting in the Byculla constituency, as she stands for Akhil Bhartiya Sena, the political party founded by her father. In Byculla’s cluttered lanes, which saw her father rise from a mill worker to a feared gangster under the alias ‘daddy’, SSC educated Geeta and her party workers are busy devising campaign strategies including using social media tools try to reach out.
Excerpts from an interview with Tabassum Barnagarwala:
You are known as ‘Daddy’s’ daughter. This projected image of daughter of an underworld name, will it be a boon or bane for you?
That image has been there for years, but despite that I have been elected as a corporator twice. In fact, I am fortunate I am his daughter because he has done a lot of work in this constituency. I am carrying it forward now. Because of his image, people know me and also know that my father will help everyone with any work they have. (smiles) The fact that I am a don’s daughter will not pose a problem in this election, it will get me more votes.
What are the lessons learnt following 2009 elections in which ABS lost to Congress’ Madhu Chavan?
That time the situation was different. My father had got arrested and our office remained shut for a brief period. Our connection with the local people was lost. Now to reach out to those 2.5 lakh people in Byculla, I am doing door-to-door campaigning. I am not tackling a particular community like Muslim or Marathis even though there is 30-35 per cent Muslim concentration. Everyone is equal to me and this time I will work for all communities to increase vote share.
What are the issues you are going to focus on?
I am not specifically focusing on any issue. I will take up issues as and when I am told about it. Daddy has done a lot of work already. But in the last five years our party has lost touch. So I will try to fill that gap. Our manifesto however focuses on women safety, health and sanitation.
You are currently public health committee chairman. If you become MLA, what will you work on?
I have inducted over 2,000 health workers since 2010 in the civic body. My work in health was focused on malaria and dengue control too. If I become the MLA, I will sensitise people on health and hygiene. Residents throw garbage on roads which keeps piling up. I will mobilize private players in waste management because BMC is already understaffed and cannot keep a check in the entire city daily. May be I will involve NGOs in this work. Sanitation practices must be taught continued…

The Dalit vote  with Athawale onboardThe Dalit vote, with Athawale on board
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai |       October 7, 2014 8:26 am

In the multi-cornered contest in Maharashtra, the big question is whether the BJP-RPI alliance will damage the Shiv Sena’s prospects. In a state where Dalits play a significant role in tilting the scales with more than 10 per cent of the population, RPI chief Ramdas Athawale is still the most popular Dalit leader.
Although the Congress and NCP tried to rope him in following the breakdown of the alliance with the Shiv Sena, he chose to stick to the BJP.
In the 2009 polls, the Shiv Shakti-Bhim Shakti slogan coined by late Bal Thackeray worked to the advantage of the Sena, which bagged nine out of 29 seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes. The Congress won the same number of seats while the BJP won seven and NCP bagged four. Although the 29 reserved SC seats account for just 10 per cent of the 288 Assembly seats, Dalit votes play a decisive role in the electoral outcome of at least 60 seats across Vidarbha, Marathwada and Mumbai.
The RPI’s move to distance itself from the Sena may have an impact in its stronghold in parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha.
Dalit writer-activist Arjun Dangle says, “In the real sense there is not a single constituency in the state where you will find a Dalit population less than 15,000 to 95,000. These do not include the reserved seats, which are Dalit-dominated with populations over 1.25 lakh. There is a marked shift in the Dalit voters of today. They are looking for a strong alternative in the political system. If change is the mantra it is unlikely they would consolidate in favour of Congress or NCP. Dalits will not completely desert Sena.”
But Athawale argues, “The decision to join BJP was taken after formal consultations within the organisation. And everybody believed that current mood is for development.
So the preference was BJP, which has the government at the Centre.” The BJP expects the Dalit support would help them in at least 30 to 35 seats across Vidarbha, Marathwada and Mumbai.
The Congress and NCP have made concerted efforts to hold on to their Dalit turf through local leaders such as former minister Nitin Raut (Nagpur) who was never projected across the state or even the Vidarbha region. The Congress has also got Yogendra Kawada, who has a following in the Nagpur region.
However, both parties have failed to get established leaders like Ambedkar’s grandson Prakash on board. Prakash Ambedkar, who heads the Bharip Bahujan Mahasang, has a strong following in Amravati, Akola and Bulshana in Vidarbha region. Although he has not been able to win a sizeable number of seats, his stand has been anti-Congress and anti-BJP.
Ambedkar says, “We are battling the mainstream parties. We don’t make a distinction among these four parties.”
In this elections, the BJP has played its cards well to retain Athawale’s support. To begin with, it went the extra mile to give him a Rajya Sabha seat.
This sent a positive message to the Dalits across the state.
In a candid admission, Athawale said, “After their split I was continued…

Shares of technology stocks are rallying as dollar gains strength. The rupee depreciated by 19 paise to trade at almost seven-month low of 61.94 against the US currency in early trade today on capital outflows amidst the dollar’s gain against other currencies overseas. The BSE IT index is up around 1.5 percent intraday.
IT stocks are also riding on the euphoria that the second quarter earnings will be better. Goldman Sachs says that Q2 is a seasonally strong quarter for Indian IT and current market expectations from some large-cap peers appear subdued.
“We expect 2QFY15E to witness 4.7 percent quarterly USD revenue growth versus 3.3 percent Q-o-Q growth in 1QFY15. USD revenue growth will be negatively impacted by 40-70 basis points due to cross currency impact mainly from negative 3.5 percent depreciation in euro,” it says in a report.
Forex dealers said besides the dollar’s gains against other currencies overseas on the back of upbeat US data, increased demand for the American unit from importers and a weak opening in the domestic equity market, put pressure on the rupee.
The domestic currency had lost 22 paise to end at 61.75 against the US dollar in yesterday’s trade as month-end demand for the American currency from oil importers weighed on the local unit.

Warren Buffett Defends Burger King s Plan To Flee To Canadareddit
Warren Buffett defended Burger King's plan to expatriate to Canada in an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box Thursday morning, saying that the deal isn't a move to skirt taxes.
"I would tell you that overwhelmingly most inversion deals have had a huge tax motivation in doing them. I can tell you this one didn't," the billionaire Berkshire Hathaway CEO responded when host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked if the deal was unpatriotic.
In August, Burger King announced plans to acquire the Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons for about $11 billion, moving the struggling fast-food company's headquarters from Miami to Toronto. The deal, which would create a combined company with projected sales of $23 billion , has been under scrutiny by critics who accuse Burger King of trying to dodge paying U.S. taxes.
"It doesn't have anything to do with taxes. It has to do with the fact that Tim Hortons earns twice as much money as Burger King does," Buffett said.
Though Burger King did not respond immediately to a request for comment, the company has maintained in the past that the deal isn't about dodging taxes.
In September, the  U.S. Treasury Department announced new rules that would make so-called inversion deals more difficult, but it's unclear if the new rules will have much of an impact on Burger King.

(Reuters) - Names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of the holders of some 83 million households and small business accounts were exposed when computer systems at JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> were recently compromised by hackers, making it one of the biggest data breaches in history.
The bank revealed the scope of the previously disclosed breach on Thursday, saying that there was no evidence that account numbers, passwords, user IDs, birth dates or Social Security numbers had been stolen.
It added that it has not seen "unusual customer fraud" related to the attack which exposed contact information for 76 million households and 7 million small businesses.
The people affected are mostly account holders, but may also include former account holders and others who entered their contact information at the bank’s online and mobile sites, according to a bank spokeswoman.
Security experts outside of the bank warned that the breach could result in an increase in crime as scammers will likely attempt to use the stolen information to engage in various types of fraud.
The bank's customers should be on heightened alert for fraud, said Mark Rasch, a former federal cyber crimes prosecutor.
"All of this data is useful to hackers and identity thieves," he said. "The kind of information that was stolen is not sensitive itself, but is frequently used to validate people's identities."
Tal Klein, vice president with the cybersecurity firm Adallom, said that the breach could undermine confidence in the security of banks and other companies that people assume are well protected from hackers.
"Criminals could literally take on the identities of these 83 million businesses and people. That's the biggest concern," he said.
"Until now the assumption has been that the companies that get breached are the ones that have poor security practices, but we know that JPMorgan had a good security program and that they invest heavily in this area," he said. "So what we are waking up to is that the fundamental nature of security is broken."
Still, JPMorgan advised customers on its website that it does not believe they need to change their passwords or account information.
Company spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said that the bank is not offering credit monitoring to its customers because no financial information, account data or personally identifiable information was compromised.
At the end of August, JPMorgan said it was working with U.S. law enforcement authorities to investigate a possible cyber attack. As with home break-ins, it can take victims of data attacks months to discover what, if anything, is missing.

JPMorgan Breach Is  Crisis Point  For BanksJPMorgan Breach Is 'Crisis Point' For Banks

LOS ANGELES (AP) — New details on a cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s computer servers this summer add to increasing doubts over the security of consumer data kept by lenders, retailers and others.
The New York-based bank disclosed Thursday that the breach compromised customer information pertaining to roughly 76 million households and 7 million small businesses.
Among the customer data stolen were names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses, though only customers who use the websites Chase.com and JPMorganOnline and the apps ChaseMobile and JPMorgan Mobile were affected, the bank said.
JPMorgan stressed that there's no evidence that the data breach included account numbers, passwords, Social Security numbers or dates of birth. It also noted that it has not seen any unusual customer fraud stemming from the data breach.
The server breach follows data thefts that have hit financial firms and major retailers this year, adding to consumer concerns over the risk of identity theft and fraud.
The Chase heist is even more disturbing than the recent retail breaches because banks are supposed to have fortress-like protection against intruders, said Gartner security analyst Avivah Litan.
"This is really a slap in the face of the American financial services system," Litan said. "Honestly, this is a crisis point."
JPMorgan Chase, the nation's biggest bank by assets, has been working with law enforcement officials to investigate the cyberattack.
The bank discovered the intrusion on its servers in mid-August and has since determined that the breach began as early as June, spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said.
"We have identified and closed the known access paths," she said, declining to elaborate.
She also declined to comment on whether JPMorgan has been able to determine who was behind the cyberattack on its servers.
In response to the data breach, the company has disabled compromised accounts and reset passwords of all its technology employees, Wexler said.
In a post on its Chase.com website, the bank told customers that it doesn't believe they need to change their password or account information. It also noted that customers are not liable for unauthorized transactions when they promptly alert the bank.
The breach is yet another in a series of data thefts that have hit financial firms and major retailers.
Last month, Home Depot said that malicious software lurking in its check-out terminals between April and September affected 56 million debit and credit cards. Michaels and Neiman Marcus also have been attacked by hackers in the past year.
A data breach at Target in December compromised 40 million credit and debit cards. TJX Cos.'s theft of 90 million records, disclosed in 2007, remains the largest data breach at a retailer.
Chase's assurances that it hasn't found any evidence of the personal data being misused shouldn't be misinterpreted as a reason to rest easy. The information still could be used in a variety of ways to rip off people in the months and years ahead.
That means consumers and business owners need to be more vigilant than ever, making sure to pore over their financial statements each month for any sign of suspicious activity. People also should be more leery than ever of unsolicited phone calls from purported bank representatives, emails fishing for their financial information and even uninvited guests knocking at their doors.
"You have to be paranoid now. You can't slack off," Litan said. "There is no such thing as data confidentiality anymore. Everything is out there."
Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO, said in this year's annual report that despite spending millions on cybersecurity, JPMorgan remained worried about the threat of attacks. By the end of this year, the bank estimates that it will be spending about $250 million annually on cybersecurity and employing 1,000 people in the area.
In August, the FBI said that it was working with the Secret Service to determine the scope of recent cyber attacks against several American financial institutions.
Last month, JPMorgan began notifying customers that it would reissue credit or debit cards in the wake of the data breach at Home Depot. Wexler said the bank doesn't plan to reissue cards as a result of the breach of its servers, noting that customer account information was not stolen.

Thousands Of Hidden Mountains DiscoveredScientists Discover Thousands Of Uncharted Mountains Hidden Beneath The Sea

A new topographic map of the seafloor shows much more detail than the previous map, released in the 1997. | Live Science/NOAA/Scripps
reddit
A new topographic map of Earth's mysterious ocean floor reveals thousands of towering volcanoes, hidden gashes where supercontinents ripped apart and other never-before-seen features once veiled by miles of water and thick sediment.
The topography of Earth's seafloor is as corrugated and bumpy as a book set in Braille. By reading these peaks and ridges, scientists can chronicle the birth of new ocean crust and the past wanderings of Earth's continents.
However, even though the seafloor carries the pivotal clues to plate tectonics , the dry surface of Mars has been detailed more clearly than the ocean's watery depths.
The new map, released today (Oct. 2) in the journal Science, promises to fill in some of the blanks. Compared with the previous map, from 1997, the resolution is twice as accurate overall and four times as better in coastal areas and the Arctic, said lead study author David Sandwell, a marine geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. [ Hidden Undersea Mountains Uncovered With Satellites (Photos) ]
Eyes in the sky
As with the earlier 1997 map, scientists expect to improve their knowledge of Earth's geologic history based on new features revealed by the map's finer scale.
"I think these data are pretty important in terms of the details that are going to come out," Sandwell told Live Science.
The seafloor topography comes from a gravity model of the ocean, which is in turn based on altimetry from the Jason-1 and Cryosat-2 satellites.
The seafloor map revealed 15,000 new seamounts.
Altimetry measures sea surface height from space by timing how long it takes a radar signal to reflect off the ocean and return. The ocean surface has subtle highs and lows that mimic both seafloor topography and Earth's gravity field.
"[These] results are a breakthrough in space-based marine gravity observation," Cheinway Hwang, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary accompanying the report. Hwang is a professor at National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
Thousands of volcanoes
The world's volcano count jumped tremendously thanks to the new map. The number of seamounts soared from around 5,000 to about 20,000, Sandwell said. Seamounts are small, conical volcanoes that are usually inactive or extinct. In the deep ocean, tall seamounts attract a riot of marine life . The map captures all seamounts more than 0.9 miles (1.5 kilometers) tall.
Some of the new seamounts appear in linear chains, but many do not. That suggests the volcanoes did not erupt above a mantle plume, a blob of hot rock that rises from the deep mantle (the layer under the crust). Some scientists think mantle plumes don't exist, but, as with climate change, the majority of researchers agree on the concept but argue about the details .
Finding patterns in the newly identified seamounts may help resolve the debate. "There's a notion that many linear volcanic chains aren't formed by mantle plumes, and I agree with that," Sandwell said. "If we can map out their complete distribution, then we can understand how they grow and evolve and so on."
The motion of Earth's tectonic plates created some of the most distinct features visible on the seafloor. These include spreading ridges and fracture zones, where the massive plates pull apart and lava oozes to the surface. Plates are created at spreading ridges and recycled at deep ocean trenches. The ocean trenches appear as deep blue troughs in the gravity map. [ Infographic: Tallest Mountain to Deepest Ocean Trench ]
"Even now, I'm just amazed by how simple seafloor spreading patterns are," Sandwell told Live Science. "They're just like in the textbooks. It's just perfect plate tectonics."
Behold, Earth's wrinkles
For the first time, the global seafloor topography captures the abyssal hills, the most common surface feature on Earth, the study reports. While the secrets of the origin are still debated, scientists think a combination of faulting and volcanism at spreading ridges creates the hills. The corrugated ridges and valleys cover up to 30 percent of Earth's surface, by some estimates. "They're the most common landform on the planet, and I'm always amazed that people have never heard of them," Sandwell said.
Along coastlines, the data uncovered faults and fractures buried under thick piles of mud and sand pouring off the continents.
Sandwell and his colleagues highlighted the new details seen in fracture zones that extend from South America to Africa. "We can see these transform faults or fracture zones all the way up to the continental margins that are currently buried by sediments, and you couldn't before," Sandwell said. Though the two continents seem to fit together like puzzle pieces, "squiggles" in the fractures tell of tectonic complexity during their breakup , he added. "These are a new thing," Sandwell said. Analyzing such details around each continent will improve reconstructions of past plate motions.
In the Gulf of Mexico, the researchers identified a defunct spreading ridge now entombed under miles of sediment. The spreading ridge opened the gulf about 150 million years, when the Yucatan Peninsula pivoted counterclockwise from North America. [ In Images: How North America Grew as a Continent ]
"Because of a major improvement in accuracy, this new gravity field will lead to more discoveries of tectonic features, especially in regions with thick sediments," Hwang wrote.
Most of the new ridges, faults and volcanoes were undiscovered because 80 percent of the ocean floor has never been charted by ships. The new topography will improve depth estimates in much of the ocean, the researchers said.

The UAN members' portal is likely to be launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 16, a senior official said adding that in the first phase the members' accounts would be accessible and become portable for lifetime.
As the UAN will be a portable account, the formal sector workers would not have to apply for transfer of PF accounts on changing jobs.
The official said that eventually the EPFO would provide more value added services like paperless settlement of provident fund withdrawal claims like during retirement and fixing of pension after attaining the age of 58 years.
According to him, the EPFO is on track to complete the seeding of over four crore UANs issued in the last week of July this year.
As per the information uploaded on the website of the EPFO, there are 4.18 crore contributing members who are employed in 4.3 lakh different firms across the country.
At present, EPFO has already captured bank account details in respect of 2.04 crore employees, PAN details of 92.94 lakh employees and Aadhar number in respect of 35.4 lakh workers.
The official said that in order to improve the quality of service under the UAN programme, at least bank account number of all the members need to be seeded with portable PF accounts as this would make the PF withdrawal and other claims settlements less time consuming.
EPFO has recently made it mandatory for firms to provide their employees' bank account numbers with IFSC code of bank branch to facilitate allotment of universal PF account number and payment to its subscribers.
As per an office order, the firms would have to furnish the information regarding the core banking account number with IFSC code of the bank branch in respect of existing members by October 15.

FII inflows in equities hit 7-month low of 5 100 crore in SeptemberComments
Overseas investors have pumped in alittle over Rs. 5,100 crore in Indian equity markets in September, making it the lowest net investment in seven months.
Foreign investors were gross buyers of equities worth Rs. 93,493 crore last month, while they sold shares amounting to Rs. 88,391 crore - translating into a net investment of Rs. 5,102 crore ($845 million) for the period, as per the latest data.
This was the lowest net investment by foreign investors in equity markets since February when they had infused Rs. 1,404 crore.
Market analysts said the government's decision to defer gas price hike coupled with the Supreme Court's verdict on cancellation of coal blocks provided foreign investors some reason to offload shares. Foreign investors are still upbeat on the Indian equity market, they added.
However, overseas investors (Foreign Institutional Investors, sub-accounts or foreign portfolio investors) continued to bet on the debt market and poured in close to Rs. 16,000 crore ($2.6 billion) in this segment. Since the beginning of this year, foreign investors have infused a net amount of Rs. 83,438 crore ($14 billion) into the share market, while they invested a net of Rs. 1.18 lakh crore into the debt market ($19.6 billion).
Strong inflows in the previous months have taken the cumulative net investments of foreign investors into Indian capital markets (equity and debt) to $204 billion, or Rs. 9.88 lakh crore, in nearly 22 year period.

Samsung overtakes Apple in the premium tablet category in Q3Samsung overtakes Apple in the premium tablet category in Q3
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 05, 2014
First Published: 22:41 IST(5/10/2014) | Last Updated: 22:45 IST(5/10/2014)

The July launch of the Galaxy Tab S has helped South Korean handset maker Samsung score a small victory over its arch rival, US-based Apple Inc, in India, though it still has a lot of ground to cover in the mobile handset category.
Samsung, which is locked in a number of patent litigations with Apple in various markets, has piped the American company in market share in the premium tablet segment.
“Samsung is the market leader in the premium tablet segment of Rs. 35,000 and above,” according to a report by research agency GSK.
Apple dominated this category in the first quarter (January-March) and second quarter (April-June) with more than 75% market share. While Samsung was way behind at less than 20% in both quarters, the Korean firm has overtaken Apple with 56% market share in the third quarter (July-September). The iPad maker has secured only 44%.
The Galaxy Tab S, which boasts of a super AMOLED display in 10.5-inch and 8.4-inch versions, has helped the Korean major double its average market share.
“Improved discretionary spends by end users and festive buying is expected to drive growth in the tablet market,” said Kiran Kumar, research manager, client devices at IDC India.
In the mobile handset space, Samsung is facing tough competition in mid-size and even at the top-end segment.
It recently launched the Galaxy Alpha smartphone priced at Rs. 39,990, in a market where domestic companies such as Micromax, Karbon, XOLO and Lava are aggressively marketing their smart phones on Android and Windows platforms.
The new smartphones in the Nokia’s Lumia series, which run on the latest Windows opesrating system, and Huawei’s recent 3G and 4G smartphones are likely to fuel the competition further.
“The fight is tough…the dominant players position has been tested best in India,” said NK Goyal, telecom analyst and founder of CMIE.

More features likely in domestic travel insuranceMore features likely in domestic travel insurance
M Saraswathy | Mumbai Oct 06, 2014 12:20 AM IST
Travel insurance, especially on the domestic front, is to come with more features for customers.
"The product is one of the cheapest in the market. Hence, even if claims are low, it will not be possible to bring down the cost further. What we as an industry can do is to add more features to the basic policy," said a senior general insurance executive. Of the total non-life product portfolio, travel insurance contributes barely two to three per cent of total business.
The premiums for domestic travel insurance range between Rs 150 and Rs 2,000, depending on tenure and coverage. Currently, domestic travel policies are usually offered in association with travel portals and are priced at Rs 100-Rs 200 for domestic air travel. The shortest duration for which one can buy travel insurance is seven days. For instance, on an annual policy, which allows unlimited trips of less than 30 days each, the premium is around Rs 2,700. Sector executives said the additional features could include assistance for emergency evacuation during domestic travel, apart from covers for hand baggage. This would be available at the same price.
"This could help increase the purchase of travel insurance, very low on priority among individuals while travelling in India," said the underwriting head at a private general insurer.
A survey by ICICI Lombard said while Indians travel more frequently and on longer duration trips, there is low demand for travel insurance. The ICICI Travel Trends 2014 survey said for domestic trips, only four per cent of respondents took a travel cover, though 86 per cent were aware of it and 64 per cent thought it was essential.
Travel insurance offers medical expenses due to emergency ailments or accidents. Other expenses covered include costs on missed or delayed flights, alternative accommodation, misplaced baggage and evacuation in case of an accident due to natural calamities. In addition, these policies offer additional amounts for accidental death and associated transportation for family and accommodation for extended stay.
Given the rising popularity of adventure sports such as motor rallies, bungee jumping and rafting, insurance companies also offer policies for such holidays, albeit at a higher premium. Accidents or death resulting from these sports are not covered under a basic travel policy.

Upgrades exceeds downgrades, but credit woes remain: CRISIL
According to CRISIL, improvement in credit quality will be gradual and any significant recovery will be contingent to a sustainable increase in investment demand

Moneycontrol Bureau
Rating agency CRISIL says corporate India’s credit quality is showing early signs of recovery, with number of rating upgrades outscoring downgrades 741:451 during the first half of this fiscal.
But it is too early to celebrate, the rating agency says.
“Despite the credit ratio exceeding 1 time, the ratio of the quantum of debt of the firms upgraded, to that of those downgraded (excluding financial sector players) remained weak at 0.59 times during the same period, reflecting continued pressure on systemic credit quality,” says the CRISIL report.
According to CRISIL, improvement in credit quality will be gradual and any significant recovery will be contingent to a sustainable increase in investment demand.
And for that to happen, the government will have to push through big ticket policy reforms, says Pawan Agrawal, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings.
“Credit quality buoyancy in the overall economy is still some time away,” says Agrawal in the CRISIL report.
Firms with low debt exposure mostly from export-linked sectors and non-discretionary consumer segments such as traders, packaged foods, pharmaceuticals, textiles and agricultural products, have seen the highest upgrade rates, the CRISIL report says.
Players operating in the construction, engineering and capital goods, and automobile (auto) ancillary sectors had higher downgrade rates than their counterparts in other sectors.

CII business survey projects 6 per cent growth in FY15CII business survey projects 6 per cent GDP growth in FY15
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 15:11 IST

According to the 88th Business Outlook Survey by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), six per cent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is within the country's reach in the current fiscal.
"Indicating a sharp improvement for the second consecutive quarter, the CII Business Confidence Index (CII-BCI) for July-September quarter FY15 has shot up to 57.4, up from 53.7 in April-June quarter and 49.9 in January-March quarter this year. During the same quarter last fiscal, the index had touched the all-time low value of 45.7," the CII said in a release in the national capital Monday.
The number 50 is the dividing line on the survey's index between positive and weak business confidence.
"Thirty per cent respondents expected GDP to grow in a range of 5.5-6.0 per cent in FY15, which indicates that 6 per cent growth is within reach this year," it added.
The jump in business confidence for the second consecutive quarter as seen in the survey, based on responses from over 150 industry members distributed over large, medium, small and micro firms, is rooted in expectation of recovery in sales coupled with sharp decline in input costs.
"The determination shown by the new government at the Centre to provide an impetus to growth along with reviving the 'feel good' factor has sent the business confidence index soaring for the second quarter in a row," CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
With the revival in domestic and global demand, a majority (46 per cent) of the surveyed businesses were contemplating new investment in the July-September quarter, while only a minor 10 per cent expected contraction, CII said.
"This indicates that economic recovery is sustainable, provided we maintain the demand momentum, where the monetary stance by the Reserve Bank (RBI) will play a crucial role," it added.
Observing that the country is currently positioned to reach the Reserve Bank of India's inflation target of 6 per cent by January 2016, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan last week decided to keep key policy rates unchanged. The central bank kept the lending rate, or the repo rate, unchanged at 8 per cent, while retaining the short-term borrowing, or reverse repo rate, at 7 per cent and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) at 4 per cent.
CII cited the slow pick up in global demand, high inflation and rising borrowing costs as the top three concerns of the respondents.
"While we can do little about addressing the global slowdown concern, all policy options must be explored to tackle the problem of inflation and high borrowing cost," it added.
Reflecting upward trends in demand, the survey found the businesses have started experiencing a rise in capacity utilisation, which augurs well for a turnaround of the economy.
A significant 77 per cent of the respondents expected their sales to increase in the July-September quarter, much higher than 50 per cent respondents in the previous quarter.
Moreover, 49 per cent of the respondents expected their export orders to increase in July-September quarter compared to 39 per cent respondents in the previous quarter.

In pics: Classic car parade in Mexico sets world recordClassic car enthusiasts have broken a Guinness world record for the biggest parade of its sort, lining up 1,721 shining Mustangs and Cadillacs as well as cheerily decorated Volkswagen Beetles.
"It's amazing, we seek the extraordinary in the ordinary," Guinness World Records adjudicator Evelyn Carrera told AFP.
Yesteray's feat eclipsed the previous record set in 2002 in Zandvoort in The Netherlands, with 948 vehicles. The Mexico City government said in a statement that the parade turned the Paseo de la Reforma avenue that runs through the heart of the capital into an "authentic and rolling museum".
More than 250,000 spectators viewed the cars along the 5.6-kilometer route, the city said.
In May, a sea of 3,634 chefs in white aprons and scores of racing waiters set a pair of Guinness world records in Mexico City -- for the most chefs in a single place and for the most waiters with drinks on their silver trays participating in an 800-meter race.

Discovery of brain s GPS gets Nobel for MedicineMia Shanley, Niklas Pollard     Stockholm   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 19:03 IST
John O'Keefe, Nobel Prize winner for 2014 in medicine
Anglo-American John O'Keefe and Norwegian couple May-Britt and Edvard Moser won the 2014 Nobel Prize for medicine on Monday for discovering the brain's internal positioning system, helping humans find their way and giving clues to how strokes and Alzheimer's affect the brain.
The Nobel Assembly, which awarded the prize of 8 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million) in an announcement at Sweden's Karolinska Institute, said the discovery solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries:
"How does the brain create a map of the space surrounding us and how can we navigate our way through a complex environment?"
Ole Kiehn, a Nobel committee member and professor in the Department of Neuroscience at Karolinska Institute, said the three scientists had found "an inner GPS that makes it possible to know where we are and find our way".
O'Keefe, now director at the centre in neural circuits and behaviour at University College London, discovered the first component of the positioning system in 1971 when he found that a type of nerve cell in a brain region called the hippocampus was always activated when a rat was in a certain place in a room.
Seeing that other nerve cells were activated when the rat was in other positions, O'Keefe concluded that these "place cells" formed a map of the room.
In 1996, Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser, who are married and now based in scientific institutes in the Norwegian town of Trondheim, worked with O'Keefe to learn how to record the activity of cells in the hippocampus.
Nearly a decade later, the Moser team discovered cells, in the entorhinal cortex region in brains of rats, which function as a navigation system. These so-called "grid cells", they discovered, are constantly working to create a map of the outside world and are responsible for animals' knowing where they are, where they have been, and where they are going.
The finding, a fundamental piece of research, explains how the brain works but does not have immediate implications for new medicines, since it does not set out a mechanism of action.
But knowledge about the brain's positioning system can also help understanding of what causes loss of spatial awareness in stroke patients or those with devastating brain diseases like dementia, of which Alzheimer's is the most common form and which affects 44 million people worldwide.
"The discovery revolutionised our understanding of how the brain knows where we are and is able to navigate within our surroundings," said Andrew King, a professor of neurophysiology at Britain's University of Oxford.
CHAMPAGNE IN THE LAB
May-Britt Moser danced and drank champagne with her colleagues in Trondheim after she was told of the award.
"This is so great, this is crazy. I am just jumping, screaming," Moser told Reuters. "I am so proud of all the support that we have had. People have believed in us, in what we have been doing and now this is the reward."
The scientist was discussing data with colleagues in their lab when she was called by the secretary general of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute.
"I almost did not take the call because the discussion was so interesting," she said.
Norwegian TV showed her co-workers singing "Happy Nobel to you" to the tune of "Happy Birthday".
Her husband did not immediately learn that he had won the Nobel Prize as he was on a plane bound to Munich. Someone was waiting for him at Munich airport with flowers and gave him the news, he told the Norwegian news agency NTB.
The Mosers join a small club of married couples to win a Nobel Prize that includes scientific greats Pierre Curie and Marie Curie.
John Stein, an emeritus professor of physiology at Oxford said that, as with so many Nobel Prize winners, the discovery was at first ridiculed and dismissed, only later to get the recognition it warrants
"This is great news and well deserved," Stein said. "I remember how great was the scoffing in the early 1970s when John first described 'place cells'. 'Bound to be an artefact' and 'He clearly underestimates rats' sense of smell' were typical reactions. Now, like so many ideas that were at first highly controversial, people say: 'Well that's obvious'!"
Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year.
Prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.
In his will, Nobel specified that the bulk of his fortune should be used for prizes - in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.
Other popular medicine laureates have included Alexander Fleming for the discovery of penicillin, Ivan Pavlov for his work on the physiology of digestion, and Robert Koch for his discoveries in relation to tuberculosis.

Stockholm: Norwegian couple Mary-Britt Moser and her husband Edvard I Moser was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine this year, along with British-American scientist John O Keefe, for discovering an 'inner GPS, in the brain,' that prompts navigational activity in all creatures.
Mary-Britt Moser and Edvard I Moser is the fifth couple to have won a Nobel, and the fourth couple to share it jointly.
The first couple to have won a Nobel prize was Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie in the year 1903. Interestingly, the Curies were a very successful Nobel Prize family. The Curie's daughter Irene Joliot Curie also won a Nobel prize for Chemistry along with her husband Fredrich Joliot in 1935 for their discovery of new radioactive isotopes prepared artificially.

Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize, followed by her daughter Irene.
Gerty Theresa Cori was the third woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the first woman to win a Nobel for Physiology or Medicine with her husband Carl Ferdinand Cori in 1947. The couple was awarded for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.
More recently, Swedish sociologist and politician Alva Myrdal and her husband Gunnar Myrdal was also awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (1982) and the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (1974) respectively.
This year, the laureates' discovery might facilitate a better and much needed understanding of the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss that affects people with Alzheimer's disease.
The Nobel awards in physics, chemistry, literature and peace will be announced later this week. The economics prize will be announced next Monday.

Federal safety regulators have opened an investigation of nearly a million Ford, Mercury and Lincoln midsize sedans over whether the power-assisted steering can suddenly fail.
The probe covers 938,000 Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ cars from the 2010 through 2012 model years, as well as the 2010 and 2011 Mercury Milan. The three sedans are machanical siblings.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has received 508 complaints alleging that the cars lost power-assisted steering, causing increased steering effort. Four complaints say the problem caused crashes, but no injuries were reported.
The agency says in documents posted Monday on its website that in many cases, a warning message appeared as the failure happened. Restarting the car corrected the problem in some cases, but the problem returned in others.
The agency says it will check the scope and frequency of a problem. It could seek a recall, based on the results.
Ford says it's cooperating with the probe.

Pakistan continues ceasefire violation  fires at 40 BSF postsPakistan fires at 40 BSF posts in Jammu, protests at UN
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu, October 07, 2014

Pakistani mortars continued to pound villages along the Jammu border for a second straight day on Tuesday as they targeted 40 Border Security Force (BSF) posts in the region, wounding six civilians and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes.
 
BSF officials said Indian forces retaliated with gunfire and mortar bombs after Pakistan Rangers widened the range of their attacks to Poonch, Kanachak, Pargwal, Arnia, Akhnoor and RS Pura sectors, a day after mortar bombs killed five civilians and wounded 29 in the highest civilian death toll in a single day in more than a decade.

“Pakistan targeted 40 of our posts in RS Pura and Akhnoor sector without provocation,” said the BSF inspector general in Jammu, Rajesh Sharma. “We were then forced to fire back in equally strong measure.”
 
Media reports said the Indian and Pakistani DGMOs held talks on ceasefire violations and accused each other of violating the ceasefire.
 
India and Pakistan have been trading fire for about a week, straining India-Pakistan relations which hit a low after New Delhi called off foreign secretary-level talks in August following the Pakistani high commissioner’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders.
This year has been particularly volatile along the border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, which is due for assembly polls as Pakistan typically ratchets up border tensions every time the state holds elections.
 
Pakistan registered its protest with the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) over the firing by the Indian military along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
The BSF director general told HT on Tuesday Indian and Pakistani troops will likely continue shelling each other for a few more days, vowing to give a fitting reply in  the unexpected flare-up that has so far claimed 18 lives on both sides of the border.
 
Sartaj Aziz, Advisor to the Pakistan Prime Minister on National Security and Foreign Affairs, expressed concern over the situation along the Line of Control.
 
"The Indian government has not been able to restrain its forces despite strong diplomatic protest by Pakistan," he said.     "We call upon the Indian government to immediately cease fire and shelling and help us preserve tranquility," he said in a statement.
Aziz said the Pakistani government has been exercising "utmost restraint and responsibility”.
 
“We also extended a hand of friendship to India. However, with abrupt cancellation of foreign secretary-level talks, the Indian side has shunned all our peace overtures. We hope that the Indian side would give peace a chance," he said.
 
BSF sources said Pakistan was deliberately targeting Arnia town, which is about three kilometres from the border, to inflict maximum civilian causalities.
 
“Pakistan is firing about 1.5 km from behind the fence for effective firing. It’s also being done to move away from our radar of observation along the fence. The firing during the night is also the reason for it,” said a BSF official.
 
Home minister Rajnath Singh has urged Pakistan to stop violating the ceasefire attacks if it wants peace talks with India.
 
“We will not tolerate such acts of border violations. We are for peaceful relationship but not at the cost of security to our civilians,” Singh told HT on Monday.

J&K: 7 more hurt as Pak shelling intensifies in Arnia  RS PuraareasPrint

Seven more people were injured as Pakistan, in one of the biggest ceasefire violations this year, continued resorting to mortar shelling and heavy firing on the entire international border in Arnia, R S Pura, Kanachak and Pargwal areas, besides forward Indian positions along the Line of Control (LoC) in Bhimber Gali, Krishna Ghati and Kerni sectors of Rajouri and Poonch districts.
Pointing out that as many as 40 posts in Arnia, R S Pura, Kanachak and Pargwal areas were affected by firing from across the international border, a Border Security Force spokesman here said that the BSF troops at all the places gave a “strong and befitting reply” to the Pakistani Rangers. “Firing at some places in Pargwal is still continuing,” he said on Tuesday morning, adding that no loss or damage to BSF has been reported so far.
However, seven civilians were injured during Pakistani firing in Arnia sector since Monday night. While three of them were injured at different places last night, four others sustained splinter injuries when a mortar shell near the Arnia police station on Tuesday morning. Sources identified three of them as 85-year-old Kishan Lal of Arnia, Kiran Devi, 35, and Ankush, 10, both residents of Phalora.
In the wake of sustained firing from Pakistan that led to the death of five civilians and injuries to 35 others in Arnia, the New Delhi and the BSF had on Monday taken a hard line promising to “retaliate effectively”. In a departure from the past practice, they also said that they would neither talk to Pakistan nor seek a flag meeting to lower the tension.
Since October 3 after a lull of nearly a month, Pakistan has been resorting to continued ceasefire violation targeting civilian population living on the Indian side along both the international border and the Line of Control (LoC). Moreover, it has followed US and India’s commitment during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s last week visit to Washington to “joint and concerted efforts that include dismantling safe havens for terrorists and criminal networks, disrupting financial and tactical support for Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, D-company and Haqqani network.
The Jammu Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah too had on Monday attributed the latest incidents of ceasefire violation by Pakistan to its desperation arising out of its failure to internationalize Kashmir issue during the recent UN Assembly session.

We recommend that you go through these five stories from The Indian Express before starting your day:
1. POLITICAL BICKERING:
In his first such attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Monday accused him of a “hidden agenda” to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra, adding that he would “join hands with” the Shiv Sena “if such a situation arises”.
Raj Thackeray targets Narendra Modi: ‘has hidden agenda’ , reports Shubhangi Khapre
2. SHUNTED:
A mid-level official of the Railways claims he has been “censured for poor performance” and shunted to an “irrelevant” training course in “unexplained haste” for his refusal to supply toilet paper rolls to the residence of Railway Board chairman, Arunendra Kumar.
Punished for not supplying toilet paper to Rly chief’s home: Official – report by Shyamlal Yadav and Avishek G Dastidar
3. MAHARASHTRA POLLS:
Of the  46 BJP MLAs in Maharashtra, the Marathwada region accounts for just two. That makes it obvious why any strategy for a change in government will have to be anchored in these 46 seats, apart from parts of western Maharashtra where the Shiv Sena and the BJP would both look to shell the NCP’s Maratha fortresses.

4. OPINION:
By re-discovering Mahatma Gandhi as only an icon of cleanliness, the Narendra Modi government has taken the first step towards dismantling his legacy.
Cleansing Gandhi of radicalism , by Suhas Palshikar
5. CRICKET:
You can accuse Ravi Shastri of many things. But you can never hold him guilty of being a fence-sitter. For Shastri doesn’t mince his words. Being subtle is not his style. It’s mostly easy to fathom which side of the coin he represents.

He is yet to be identified, police said.
A BJP spokesman said that the youth was held back by party workers and police immediately, after he tried to get near to Gadkari who was heading towards the podium.

A month after J&K floods, many areas still waterlogged

Jawaharnagar: It's been a month since floods lashed Jammu and Kashmir. Some areas in Srinagar are still waterlogged with water levels as high as 3 to 5 feet. CNN-IBN spoke to a few residents of Srinagar whose houses are still submerged, including cameraperson Bashir Ahmed's house.
Around the Jawaharnagar Market, the destruction is still visible with homes wrecked and cars and other vehicles are now scrap.
Even as his own home has been submerged in water for over three weeks CNN-IBN's Bashir Ahmad is stuck to his job bringing stories of others hit by floods. At his own home, barring the walls, there is not much left.
#jammu and kashmir floods #srinagar #jawaharnagar #waterlogging
Bashir and his wife were wading through waist deep water to reach their homes after almost a month. "I had my house behind the school. Now I am going to see if it's still there. If it's there then we will take out our luggage. The government is not providing any boat or truck for us to search our houses," he said. "We want to see if our things are still there or they have got stolen," Bashir's wife said.
Residents have been forced to move around in dirty, foul water to see what remains of their houses. "We have had major losses. More houses may collapse," a resident said. "It's been 22 days but we still have water up to 3 feet," another resident added.
But even amongst this destruction, there are stories of survival. On the fateful day, the CrPF men moved to a steady house by placing a ladder. They then moved to the house - one by one - and later rescued an old woman and her family. All were put there for five days. The CrPF men are still stranded there.
Jawaharnagar and Rajbagh will take months to return to normal. Till then, with some irony, hope still floats.

Will hug Maoists if they give up violence: Chhattisgarh CM28
0
Raipur: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh on Monday said that he is ready to embrace Maoists if they give up their path of violence and join the mainstream of society.
"People involved in Maoist activities are part of our society. We are ready to hug them if they wish to join the mainstream by laying down arms and quitting violence," Singh said while addressing a 'Muria Darbar' meeting of tribals in Bastar's Jagdalpur district headquarters, according to an official release issued on Monday.
Appealing to Maoists to return to the mainstream of democracy and development, the CM emphasised they should introspect that no issue can be sorted out with violence and guns, the release said.
"We are ready to co-operate with everyone to bring an end to the menace of Maoism," the release quoted the CM as saying.
#chhattisgarh #raman singh #maoists #violence
Those who have been misguided, particularly the youth, should think about the well being of their families, society, as well as the nation and shun violence, the CM said, as per the statement.
"We are ready to co-operate with everyone to bring an end to the menace of Maoism," the release quoted the CM as saying.
He said government welfare schemes have created a better environment for economic development of tribal-dominated Bastar region and also helped win the confidence of the people.
The Chief Minister also said the Nagarnar steel plant will soon start functioning, creating ample job opportunities for the people of the region, the release said.

Bullions shine as the dollar rally takes a respiteBullions shine as the dollar rally takes a respite
Sensex down 46 points in early tradeSensex tumbles to two-month low; down 296 points on capital outflows
Agencies
Metals, healthcare, capital goods and consumer durables major losers
Mumbai, Oct 7:  
The BSE benchmark Sensex today plunged 296 points to close at nearly two-month low due to widespread losses in metal, healthcare, consumer durables and capital goods sector stocks on capital outflows and retail investors ahead of earnings season amid a mixed trend overseas.
After opening 137 points lower, the 30-share index continued its slide to touch the day’s low of 26,250.24 before ending the day at almost two-month low of 26,271.97, a level not seen since August 14, registering a steep fall of 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
The gauge had lost 62.52 points in the previous session on Octrober 1. Stock markets remained closed on October 2, 3 and 6 for Gandhi Jayanti, Dussehra and Id-Ul-Zuha, respectively.
FII/FPIs pulled out Rs 63.24 crore from domestic markets on October 1, according to exchange data.
Similarly, the broad-based NSE Nifty closed down by 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent at 7,852.40 after shuttling between 7,943.05 and 7,842.70.
Brokers said the sentiment dampened on foreign capital outflows and offloading of positions by retail investors ahead of the earnings season, with Infosys posting results later this week.
Of the 30 Sensex shares, 23 closed lower led by Hindalco (down 4.35 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (4.32 per cent) and Cipla (3.67 per cent), while NTPC, Gail and Tata Motors remained major gainers.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 63.24 crore last Wednesday as per the provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
Sectorwise, BSE metal index suffered the most by falling 2.65 per cent, followed by healthcare by 1.85 per cent.
Captial goods index by 1.78 per cent, Consumer durables index by 1.72 per cent, Realy index 1.27 per cent, PSU index 1.20 per cent and Banking index 0.87 per cent were the other significant losers.
Global markets
Globally, a mixed closing on the other Asian markets and a lower opening of the European stocks as a report showed German industrial production contracted the most in more than five years, also negatively impacted sentiment.
European shares fell in early trade on Tuesday after German industrial output fell far more than expected, but losses were limited by gains in mining shares after Rio Tinto rejected a merger approach from rival Glencore.
At 0755 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 per cent at 1,341.44 points. The benchmark index had gained 1.1 per cent over the past two sessions.
"Volatility has surged again in Europe, but there's no clear trend in terms of direction," Aurel BGC analyst Gerard Sagnier said. "It's better to move to the sidelines for now. Investors need to be patient, the bullish trend will resume at some point."
Asian shares rose on Tuesday, while the dollar languished after investors locked in some gains on its recent rally.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up about 0.3 per cent in late afternoon trade, after wobbling between positive and negative territory as it took its cues from a choppy, losing session on Wall Street overnight.
Japan's Nikkei stock average ended down 0.7 percent, after the Bank of Japan offered a bleaker view on factory output. The BOJ maintained its massive asset buying programme, as widely expected.
Hong Kong shares finished higher for a third day in a row on Tuesday, with investor confidence recovering as pro-democracy demonstrations eased in the wake of a meeting between protest leaders and government officials.
The Hang Seng Index rose 0.5 percent to 23,422.52 points. The China Enterprises Index of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was 0.6 percent higher.

Economy to grow by 6.4 per cent in FY16: WBIndian economy to grow by 6.4 per cent in FY16, says World Bank
Lalit K Jha     Washington   Last Updated: October 7, 2014  | 11:35 IST

The domestic economy, which accounts for 80 per cent of South Asia's output, is set to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2015-16 as against 5.6 per cent in 2014-15, the World Bank has said.
With economic activity buoyed by expectations from the new government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is benefiting from a Modi dividend, the Bank said in its twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus report on Monday.
Over the next year or so economic growth should be supported by the recovering United States economy that would provide a market for Indian merchandise and service exports, it said. The outlook over the next years for South Asia indicates broad economic stability and a pick-up in growth with potential risks concentrated on the fiscal and structural reform side, said Martin Rama, Chief Economist for South Asia at the World Bank.
Future growth will increasingly depend on strong investment and export performance, he added. Private investment is expected to pick up thanks to the government's business orientation, and declining oil prices should boost private sector competitiveness. But economic reforms will be needed for India to achieve its full long-term growth potential, the report argued.
The report said the region's economy will expand by a real 6 per cent in 2015 and by 6.4 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.4 per cent this fiscal year, potentially making it the second fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific. Other countries in the region are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The Bank said the country's long-term growth potential remains high due to favourable demographics, relatively high savings, and policies and efforts to improve skills and education, facilitate domestic market integration and incentivise manufacturing activities.
In the medium term, with the economy still below potential and reforms on a gradualist path, growth is expected to accelerate from 5.6 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent and 7 per cent in 2016 and 2017.
Inflation is expected to decline with monetary policy switching to inflation targeting while the current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat as import demand and capital inflows rise.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue with stronger revenue mobilisation, while the oil subsidy burden could decline to 0.6 per cent of GDP if benign global crude prices persist, it said. Supply chain delays and uncertainty are a major yet under-appreciated constraint to manufacturing growth and competitiveness in the country, it said.

White House rebukesNetanyahuIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu listens as President Barack Obama speaks during their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2014. (Source: AP)
Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: October 7, 2014 9:34 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 11:19 am
The Obama Administration has rebuked Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu after the latter said the US criticism of Israeli settlement building ran counter to the American values.
“We would note that the Prime Minister appeared only to be addressing our concerns about Silwan, and seemed to ignore our concern over reports that the Israeli government had moved forward the planning process in the sensitive area of Givat Hamatos in east Jerusalem,” White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, said.
“That action is contrary to Israel’s stated goal of negotiating a permanent status agreement with the Palestinians, and it would send a very troubling message if they were to proceed with tenders or construction,” he said.
Earnest was responding to questions about the statement made by Netanyahu in an interview over the weekend.
“It’s against the American values. And it doesn’t bode well for peace. The idea that we’d have this ethnic purification as a condition for peace, I think it’s anti-peace,” Netanyahu told the CBS news.
The White House rebuked it.
“I did see the Prime Minister’s remarks, and it did seem odd for him to try to defend the actions of his government by saying that our response did not reflect American values. The fact is, American policy has been clear and unchanged under several administrations, both Democrat and Republican,” Earnest said.
“We oppose any unilateral actions that attempt to prejudge final status issues, including the status of Jerusalem. These can only be legitimately determined through direct negotiations between the parties that this President has worked hard to try to facilitate,” he said.
He said when it came to American values, the country lent unwavering support to Israel.
It’s American values that have led us to fight for and secure funding to strengthen Israel’s security in tangible ways,” he said.
“It’s American values that have led us to fund and build an Iron Dome system that has protected the lives of countless innocent Israeli citizens. It’s American values that have led the US to fully support Israel’s right to defend itself. And it’s American values that have led us to defend Israel in a variety of international forums, including a variety of UN forums,” he added.
“So it’s clear how American values dictate or at least guide our thinking when it comes to our unwavering support for the nation of Israel,” he said.

Nifty may trade between 7960-8020: Magnum Equity Broking
According to a report by Magnum Equity Broking, Nifty is expected to trade between 8020 and 7960.
Post your opinion here
 
Magnum Equity Broking's Fundamental Report:
Indian market fell on Wednesday, with blue chips such as ITC Ltd retreating, as traders refrained from building positions ahead of an extended holiday period, while foreign investor sales also weighed on sentiment.
The Sensex fell 0.23 percent, or 62.52 points, to end at 26,567.99, also falling 0.22 percent for the week. The Nifty lost 0.24 percent, or 19.25 points, to end at 7,945.55, while marking a weekly decline of 0.29 percent. Blue-chips led the declines. ITC fell 1.7 percent, while Reliance Industries ended 2 percent lower.
Investors thus opted for caution, given lingering global risk factors such as the continued civil unrest in Hong Kong and rising worries about earlier-than-expected US rate hikes. Adding to the caution, overseas investors sold stocks worth of 4.86 billion rupees on last Tuesday, offloading shares in five out of past six sessions.
Foreign investors have been integral to Indian shares marking record highs on Sept. 8 and any signs of selling tend to spark concerns. However July-September earnings reports would also be key for near-term direction. Infosys Ltd kicks off the earnings season with quarterly results on October 10. It was a positive start to the week for stocks in Europe, although the German DAX pared gains following disappointing economic data from the country.
US stocks fell on Monday, with investors adopting a cautious approach two days before the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting and quarterly earnings. Equities in Asia were mixed on Tuesday as investors awaited central bank decisions in Japan and Australia.
Global cues are mixed today, with them SGX Nifty is showing 7 points up move in morning trade indicating that Indian market would open flat today and Nifty is expected to trade between 8020 and 7960.

Ramadorai steps down from TCSRamadorai retires from Tata companies
Our Bureau
S Ramadorai
Mumbai, Oct 7:  
S Ramadorai, a doyen of the Indian IT industry, has retired from the board of various Tata companies. This is in accordance with the Tata Group’s retirement policy, which requires non-executive directors to move on after turning 70.
Ramadorai, who celebrated his 70{+t}{+h} birthday on October 6, was the Vice-Chairman at Tata Consultancy Services, Chairman of CMC (a subsidiary of TCS) and Chairman of Tata Elxsi. The three companies have informed investors of Ramadorai’s resignation in separate disclosures to the stock exchanges.
He has also stepped down from the boards of Tata Communications and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra).
Ramadorai was made TCS’ Vice-Chairman in October 2009 after serving as the company’s Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director for 14 years. Between 1996 and 2009, TCS grew from a $160 million firm to a $6-billion behemoth. As CEO, Ramadorai is credited for introducing a shift in the leadership style, one which was built around sharing of ideas.
The story of TCS’ rise to the No.1 position in the Indian IT industry was chronicled by Ramdorai in the 2009-book The TCS Story…And Beyond.
Executives, who have worked with him, describe Ramadorai as an effective leader who has an eye for detail. He is also believed to be an expert in spotting talented individuals. The current CEO and MD N Chandrasekaran had started his career as executive assistant to Ram, as he his affably known.
In 2009, Ramadorai became chairman of Tata Elxsi.
The long-distance runner (a regular at Mumbai marathon) dons many a hat. A Carnatic music aficionado, he is also the Chairman of the National Skill Development Agency and the National Skill Development Council. In June 2013, Ramadorai was appointed as Chairman of Air Asia India.
He is also the non-executive Chairman of the Bombay Stock Exchange. Ramadorai was awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in April 2009. In 2011, the Tata Group had lowered the retirement age for non-executive directors to 70 years from the erstwhile limit of 75.

US banking giant JP Morgan Chase has issued updated information about a cyber attack which it suffered in August and that approximately 76 million current accounts and seven million small enterprises were affected.
In an official document presented before the US Security and Exchange Commission Thursday, the bank specified the type of data that was breached in the attack on the web and mobile application of JP Morgan   Chase & Co .
The information accessed by the hackers included names, addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of its clients, as well as internal information of the company.
However, the bank has not yet registered evidence of this data theft affecting the number of accounts, access codes, identity card numbers, dates of birth or social security numbers.
Although the investigations continue, the bank has not had any proof yet showing that a fraud related to this data theft has occurred, but they have been calling their clients to inform them if they face any irregularity.
"The company continues to monitor and control the situation and investigate the matter. Also, the bank is completely cooperating with all the investigative government agencies," the document said.
JP Morgan Chase was one of the five American entities victimised by an attack, the purpose of which is still unknown and which remains subject to a thorough investigation.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been trying to determine the origin of such a sophisticated cyber attack and if the motive was economic or part of an intelligence operation.
"Companies of our size unfortunately experience cyber attacks nearly everyday. We have multiple layers of defence to counteract any threats and constantly monitor fraud levels," said Patricia Wexler, JP Morgan spokesperson.
The American banking sector has been a target of frequent hacking in the last few years, and most of the attacks had an economic motive. That is why this case, which does not seem to be of the same profile, has caused special concern to the authorities.

Why This Country Prefers Rum to Whiskey
Agence France Presse | Updated On: October 03, 2014 17:39 (IST)
For decades, whiskies have been the status beverage of choice in Venezuela: an expensive, imported taste acquired during the country's oil boom.
But with the economy now in a bust, Venezuelans are increasingly returning to long-snubbed local rum.
Runaway inflation, a foreign exchange crisis and chronic shortages of basic goods have shut the door on the golden days when Venezuelans announced their country's arrival as a major oil power by buying up Scotch and Irish whiskey.
Sales of whiskies fell 29 per cent last year in Venezuela, while rum sales rose 22.6 per cent, according to International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR), a London-based consultancy.
Domestic rum production meanwhile jumped from 15.8 million litres in 2012 to 21.8 million litres last year.
"The fall in whiskey sales is due to the foreign currency shortage. There are no dollars to import it so they have to get them on the black market - nearly 15 times more expensive - and the price has greatly increased," food and drink critic Miro Popic said.
"That, combined with the fact that rum distillation has improved a lot in recent years, has made a lot of people choose rum, the cheaper option," he told AFP.
On the shelves of Venezuela's liquor stores, bottles of imported whiskies like Chivas Regal, Johnnie Walker, Old Parr and Buchanan's compete with domestic rums with names like Pampero, Santa Teresa, Cacique and Ocumare.
But in the current economic climate - with annual inflation of more than 60 per cent, President Nicolas Maduro's government battling crippling shortages of basic goods and dollars in short supply because of strict foreign exchange controls - a bottle of Scotch costs two or three times as much as a good rum.
"A lot of people have also switched to vodka or beer, but rum has made the strongest gains," said Fernando Barreto, the manager of a liquor store on the east side of the capital Caracas.
Scotch, rum and oil
Venezuela's love affair with whiskies is linked to its birth as a petro-state.
Consumption leapt with the arrival of European and American oil companies in the early to mid-1900s.
As oil rose to become the century's dominant commodity, Venezuela, home to the world's largest reserves, exported crude and imported fine Scotch and Irish whiskey, a new symbol of status and wealth.
Today Venezuelans are known for drinking whiskey with dinner and for the distinctive way they stir ice cubes around their glasses with an index finger.
Rum for its part has been distilled in Venezuela since it was a Spanish colony, but it was long considered an inferior beverage.
Its prominence in the national liquor cabinet has had an inverse relationship with crude prices, rising when they are low and falling when the oil money is flowing.
This time, however, domestic rum distilleries are trying to follow the example of Colombian coffee producers and Mexican tequila makers by refining their brand.
In 2003, the country's largest distilleries, some of them more than 100 years old, launched a "Rums of Venezuela" label that sets a high bar for quality: To sport the sticker on its bottle, a rum must age for at least two years in oak barrels.
The distilleries have now launched "premium" and "ultra-premium" brands, some of which have won international awards and drawn rave reviews from critics and connoisseurs.
"Having this economic cycle in our favor is an opportunity that we failed to take advantage of in the past," said Alberto Vollmer, president of the Santa Teresa distillery.
"Before it was just a price war to see who could get the most local market share. Now it's about building value to export more."

As Fed Retreats From Stimulus, Central Banks Overseas Expand Theirs
Binyamin Appelbaum, Jack Ewing and Neil Gough, The New York Times | Updated On: October 04, 2014 11:47 (IST)
Regulators Fine Global Banks $3.4 Billion in Forex Probe
Washington: As the growth of the United States economy outstrips the rest of the developed world, U.S. policymakers are allowing Europe, Japan and even China to seek a little more prosperity - at the expense of Americans.
The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve have watched quietly in recent years as foreign governments and central banks have chipped away at the dollar value of their currencies, strengthening their export industries in the hope of stimulating their economies.
The trend is likely to intensify over the next year as the Fed retreats from its own stimulus campaign while the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan expand their efforts. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, said on Thursday that it would begin a new round of bond purchases this month.
The U.S. has long argued that markets should determine the value of currencies and criticized nations that try to manipulate exchange rates. The current silence reflects both the simple reality that the U.S. economy needs less help than the rest of the developed world and the judgment of officials that the United States would benefit greatly from stronger global growth. That, they say, would be true even if, in the short term, it makes the country's goods a little harder to sell and jobs a little harder to find.
"You're seeing American officials turn a blind eye to Mario Draghi talking down the euro, and turn a blind eye to interventions by the Chinese, because in both cases they're making the judgment that having a stabilized situation and decent growth prospects in these countries is far more important," said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "I tend to agree with that."
U.S. leaders have embraced and celebrated a strong dollar as evidence of a strong economy. It lets Americans buy more foreign goods and borrow more cheaply from foreign countries. It also may draw foreign investors to U.S. financial markets, supporting the rise of asset prices.
But the rise of the dollar carries large risks, too. It makes it harder for U.S. companies to sell goods and services. It may be contributing to the sluggish pace of domestic inflation. And some economists warn that letting the dollar rise is not a sustainable method of encouraging growth.
The ECB still has not fully deployed the arsenal of a modern central bank to improve growth in Europe. It has refrained from the large-scale purchases of government debt undertaken by the Fed, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England.
But in recent months it has sought to push down the value of the euro through a variety of measures. In September, the ECB offered loans that were practically interest-free to commercial banks that promised to lend the money to businesses and consumers.
On Thursday, after a board meeting Naples, Italy, the central bank outlined a two-year plan to buy private sector assets, including bank loans packaged into securities. "These purchases will have a sizable impact," Draghi said at a news conference after the meeting.
So far, U.S. officials primarily seem frustrated that the European Central Bank continues to act slowly. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, last year became the rare official to call publicly for stronger action when he told an audience in Frankfurt, Germany that the ECB should buy government bonds.
Another question is whether the programs will provide a sufficient jolt. A similar lending program started by the Bank of England in 2012 has not reversed the decline in small-business lending in that country.
"Nobody's hiring, nobody's investing, nobody's spending," said Stefano Micossi, the director general of Assonime, an Italian business group. "There is no demand for credit. The system is not constrained by the funding side. The banks are awash in liquidity."
Japan, which has been grappling with the problems confronting Europe for more than two decades, is also seeking growth through currency moves. Under the "Abenomics" stimulus campaign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began in early 2013, the Bank of Japan has agreed to double the money supply, and the price of yen in dollars has dropped by about 24 percent.
The results have not met expectations. Japan's trade deficit has increased while inflation remains weak. The Japanese economy shrank by 7.1 percent in the second quarter after a sales tax increase.
China's economic rise was built on the suppression of its currency to support cheap exports at the expense of domestic consumption. Then, beginning in 2010, the People's Bank of China let the renminbi rise about 20 percent against the dollar as part of its effort to encourage a transition away from export-led growth.
But this year, with the economy growing at the slowest pace in more than a decade, China once again pressed down on the renminbi. Its value has fallen about 2 percent against the dollar so far this year.
"It was a way to stimulate the economy without resorting to full blown credit and investment-driven stimulus," said Diana Choyleva, the head of macroeconomic research at Lombard Street Research in London.
While that small change has prompted little criticism from the United States, the looming question is whether China will continue.
During the financial crisis, China's government-controlled banking system pumped money into the economy, doubling its assets over a five-year period. Many companies and local governments are now struggling to repay those debts, and authorities are reluctant to treat the pain with another major burst of lending.
Yu Yongding, a senior fellow of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing and a former member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, said it was imperative for the PBOC not to blink.
"China needs to adjust its economic structure urgently," Yu said. "The combination of the high leverage ratio, high financing costs and low profitability is a serious threat to China's financial stability."

SKETCHBOOK: For Julia Pierson  the Secret Serviceor Secret CircusBy Michael Cavna October 4 Follow @comicriffs
BY EARLY in the week, amid the latest revelations of massive security lapses, it became clear that Julie Pierson would be canned as director of the Secret Service — or rather, that she would be granted a “Washington resignation,” which simply means that she falls on her own sword without us seeing who delivered the official final push.
The inevitable arrived on Wednesday, as Pierson resigned just a day “after Obama expressed full confidence in her,” and “lawmakers from both parties were calling for her ouster after her halting performance during a House hearing Tuesday,” reported The Post’s Carol D. Leonnig and David Nakamura.
It was also on Tuesday, after that hearing, that I began mulling cartoon ideas about Pierson’s all-but-sealed departure. As I did — and as I read and heard comments about what the Secret Service was supposed to represent, and embody, and “stand for” — I kept going back to the 1993 film “In the Line of Fire,” in which Clint Eastwood plays an aging agent who is still haunted by his failure to prevent JFK’s assassination that day decades ago in Dealey Plaza. Amid the cat-and-mouse plot twists, Eastwood’s agent, Frank Horrigan, embodies the professional as throwback.
Pierson, by most accounts, was not a throwback as director. And as scrutiny of Pierson’s tenure at the top intensified, biographical details took on freighted meaning. Those included her words about her vision for the agency. The Post’s Leonnig (who of course broke multiple devastating stories about Pierson’s Secret Service) wrote that supervisors “said they were taken aback when Pierson, who worked during high school at Walt Disney World as a costumed character and park attendant, said: ‘We need to be more like Disney World. We need to be more friendly, inviting.’ ”
Once I read that, my cartoon crystallized. Coincidentally, I had already envisioned a caricature of Pierson wearing a clown nose; now a full-body costumed depiction, big shoes and all, made complete metaphoric sense.
And thus — employing even gritty throwback tints vs. “friendly” Disney-bright pastels — a contrast was drawn:

External Debt Up $12.6 Billion at $346.6 Billion in Q1: RBIFDI Dips 16 Per Cent to $2.45 Billion in September
Mumbai: India's international investment position (IIP) has deteriorated during the June quarter as net claims of non-residents rose by $12.6 billion to $346.6 billion following a sharper rise in the value of foreign-owned assets in the country vis-a-vis a rise in the value of residents' financial assets abroad.
"Net claims of non-residents on the country, as reflected by the net IIP, rose $12.6 billion to $346.6 billion at the end of the June quarter from the previous quarter," the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said.
This change in the net position shows a $22.9 billion increase in the value of foreign-owned assets in the country vis-a-vis a $10.4 billion increase in the value of residents' financial assets abroad, the apex bank said.
However, the ratio of the country's international financial assets to international financial liabilities improved to 58.7 per cent in the June quarter from 59.1 per cent in the March quarter.
On an annual basis, the numbers deteriorated much faster as net IIP in June 2013 quarter stood at $313.4 billion, an increase of $33.2 billion. In the September quarter of FY14, net IIP had stood at a $302.7 billion while the same was $318.8 billion in the December 2013 quarter.
Similarly, residents' financial assets abroad, too, rose by $10.4 billion in Q1 to $492.8 billion from $482.4 billion in Q4 of FY14. On an annual basis, assets rose by $58.3 billion from $434.5 billion. This stood at $436.7 billion in Q2 of FY14 and at $458.9 billion in Q3 of FY14.
As per the RBI data, deterioration in net IIP was due to a sharper spike in the value of foreign-owned assets in the country vis-a-vis the increase in the value of residents' financial assets abroad.
Measured as financial assets of residents, net IIP are claims on non-residents and gold/bullion held as reserve assets less financial liabilities of the residents to non-residents. The IIP shows the value and the composition of the financial assets of residents that are claims on non-residents, and gold/bullion held as reserve assets; and the liabilities of residents to non-residents.
On the composition of external financial assets and liabilities, the RBI said the reserve assets continued to have the dominant share of 64.2 per cent in the overseas financial assets, followed by direct investment (FDI) abroad at 26.2 per cent.
The share of direct investment stood at 29.8 per cent, portfolio investment at 24.3 per cent, loans at 21.5 per cent, and currency and deposits at 12.7 per cent. The share of non-debt liabilities rose marginally to 46 per cent in Q1 from 45.5 per cent in the previous quarter.

Foreign-Owned Assets in India Up at $839 Billion on Quarter in April-JuneFDI Dips 16 Per Cent to $2.45 Billion in September
New Delhi: Foreign-owned assets in India increased by $22.9 billion over the previous quarter to $839.3 billion during the quarter ended June 2014, Reserve Bank (RBI) data showed.
This is mainly due to increase of $10.6 billion in portfolio investment in India and increase of $7.6 billion in direct investment into the country.
Among other investment liabilities, currency and deposits increased by $2.4 billion and loans (mainly external commercial borrowings) rose by $1.2 billion, according to RBI data on International Investment Position (IIP) for April-June.
The ratio of India's international financial assets to international financial liabilities stood at 58.7 per cent in June 2014 (59.1 per cent in March 2014). On the assets front, the Indian residents' financial assets abroad stood at $492.8 billion, up $10.4 billion from previous quarter due to a rise of $11.9 billion in reserve assets.
The gap between assets and liabilities in this regard led to the rise in net claims of non-residents on India by $12.6 billion to $346.6 billion as of June 2014.
"This change in the net position reflected a $22.9 billion increase in the value of foreign-owned assets in India vis-a-vis a $10.4 billion increase in the value of Indian residents' financial assets abroad," the RBI said.
The difference in assets and liabilities, reflected by the net International Investment Position (IIP), is disseminated with one quarter lag.
The IIP data is an important input for understanding external sustainability and vulnerability, and is also useful in analysing the economic structure.

Bill Gross Told Rival Gundlach:  I am Kobe  You are LeBronDDA Housing Scheme: Draw to be Held on Tuesday
New York:
It was one of the most extraordinary meetings in the history of the bond market. Two of the biggest-ever names in fixed-income investing, Bill Gross and Jeffrey Gundlach, fierce rivals who had never previously talked, held a secret meeting over glasses of lemonade, water, and plates of crudites about whether to join forces.
In the week of September 15, just before Gross shocked the investment world on September 26 by storming out of Pimco, he approached Gundlach and dropped a bombshell. According to Gundlach, Gross said he was about to be fired by the firm he had helped launch more than four decades ago and had built into a $2 trillion investment powerhouse.
Gross disclosed he had been toying with quitting for some time after Pimco erupted in turmoil earlier this year when Gross' heir apparent, Mohamed El-Erian, left the firm, sparking a public falling out between the two long-time colleagues. And Gross also told Gundlach he had been in talks with another firm some six months ago. He did not say which firm it was, Gundlach said.
Reuters first reported the meeting between Gross and Gundlach, who runs DoubleLine Capital, the day of Gross' departure from Pimco for Janus Capital Group. Gundlach has now provided Reuters with a much fuller picture of how the meeting came to pass and what they discussed over three hours on the north loggia of Gundlach's Los Angeles home.
Gross declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this story or to confirm Gundlach's account of their meeting. Representatives for Pimco, a unit of German insurer Allianz SE, and Janus, which is a much smaller player in the asset management business, declined to comment. DoubleLine has been among the firms to benefit as investors have ditched Pimco following Gross's departure.
PRANKSTER FEAR
Gundlach said that Gross called him out of the blue.
"Bill called through the DoubleLine switchboard," said Gundlach.
Skeptical that it was really Gross, Gundlach said he "told the receptionist to take a number and then call it to verify it was not some prankster. A couple of hours later I called Bill from home."
In that initial phone conversation, Gundlach said: "Bill came out and told me: 'Pimco doesn't want me anymore.' And I said, 'That is an unbelievably stupid decision.'"
"Then he told me, 'They are going to push the button and fire me.' To which I said, "This is really distressing."
"They" were the members of Pimco's executive committee, chaired by Pimco Chief Executive Doug Hodge.
Hodge and Pimco President Jay Jacobs, through a Pimco spokesman, declined to comment for this story.
Gross' position at Pimco had grown precarious in the months since El-Erian left. The firm's flagship fund, the Pimco Total Return Fund, run by Gross personally, was underperforming and bleeding assets through redemptions. Sources have told Reuters that Gross had clashed repeatedly with Hodge and the executive committee, threatening to quit on several occasions. He finally did quit for Janus, hours before the committee was planning to dismiss him.
Gundlach said he told Gross he sympathized with him as Gundlach himself had been fired in 2009 by TCW Group, at the time owned by French bank Societe Generale SA, in a dispute over management and control of the firm's fixed-income business.
Gross, who is 70, told Gundlach he didn't want to retire, according to Gundlach. He wanted to keep managing money, albeit less of it.
At the conclusion of their phone call, Gundlach, 54, invited Gross, who lives south of Los Angeles in Newport Beach near Pimco's headquarters, to Gundlach's home about an hour-and-a-half away.
"I did think there could be some kind of 'Dream Team' concept," Gundlach said.
'TOO MUCH MONEY'
Gross arrived in a chaffeur-driven car the next afternoon around 4 p.m. The two perched in Gundlach's open-air loggia with mountainside views of the Pacific Ocean and for three hours talked about their careers, Gross' travails at Pimco and the possibility of the two men - both at various times nicknamed "bond king" by the financial press - combining forces.
Gross came well-informed about Gundlach, saying that his wife, Sue Gross, had probed extensively into the younger man's history.
The results of her research were very complimentary of Gundlach's career achievements, Gundlach said.
Gundlach told his rival that Gross had set the bar too high through years of out-performance that had allowed Gross to build the Total Return Fund into the world's largest bond fund, which at its peak in April 2013 had nearly $293 billion in assets. The fund was now too large to manage, and unfairly even a few years of average performance was now considered a failure, Gundlach said.
"I said to Bill: 'You are running too much money.' Bill agreed, saying 'absolutely, smaller is better.'"
"It was clear that Bill had reconciled himself to the weaker performance being because of the fact that he was running too much money," Gundlach said. "There was no disagreement at all. This change he is making is a good thing for his ability to perform."
In fact, Gross had proposed to Pimco's executive committee that he manage considerably less money - roughly $40 billion to $50 billion - and that he no longer wanted to run the flagship fund, Gundlach said that Gross told him.
Instead, Hodge and Jacobs told Gross the executive committee had reached a different decision. Gross told Gundlach the committee said: "We want you to leave soon."
'I HAVE FIVE RINGS, YOU HAVE TWO'
Word of the face-to-face meeting between Gundlach and Gross surprised the bond world. For two decades, the two had no relationship or interaction at all, even though their personas were intertwined, compared and contrasted often in the financial media and by other bond market players.
Morningstar named Gross "Fixed Income Manager of the Decade" in 2010, an award for which Gundlach was a finalist. Then in 2011, Barron's magazine anointed Gundlach as the new King of Bonds.
Gundlach, for his part, said he never considered that he and Gross had been "adversaries" though he admits the two clearly competed "to log better returns than each other."
In their meeting, Gross "mentioned the 'Bond King' thing and seemed surprised when I said I never encouraged the media on that one, which is true," Gundlach said.
Discussing their potential legacies, Gundlach said Gross spun an analogy to National Basketball Association star players Kobe Bryant and the younger LeBron James.
"I am Kobe. You are LeBron James," Gross told Gundlach. "I have five rings, you have two rings - probably going to five,"a reference to the number of NBA championships the two players have each won.
The meeting ended with no decision made about a partnership, but they agreed to stay in touch. Gundlach has made it clear that he wants to remain fully in charge at DoubleLine.
Then, a week later, Gross called Gundlach on the night before his Janus announcement. He left a voicemail message saying he was leaving Pimco for another firm.

London Beats New York as Most Popular Destination for Workers: SurveyTwitter Q2 Results Soar, Stock Flies 30%
London is the most popular city in the world to work in, an international survey of more than 200,000 people found, with nearly one in six of those questioned wanting to move to the British capital to secure employment.
The study by The Boston Consulting Group and totaljobs.com found respondents from 189 countries ranked London above New York and Paris, while Britain was second behind the United States as the most appealing country for international jobseekers.
While the survey - described by its compilers as the most expansive study conducted on worker mobility - found that almost two thirds of jobseekers were willing to move abroad to work, within Britain only 44 percent of people want to move overseas for work.
"This report cements London's reputation as a truly global city," said Mike Booker, of totaljobs.com. "Not only does it offer a wealth of job opportunities in a range of industries, but it boasts some of the world's top cultural attractions, so it's no surprise that people across the globe want to come and work here."
The survey of a mixture of the employed, unemployed, self-employed and students included a mix of people actively looking for a job, those not actively looking but open to opportunities and workers not looking for a new job at the moment.

Mexico mass murder: Hitmen admit killing 17 of 43 missing Mexican studentsState police guard the road leading to the site where an alleged clandestine grave was found near the town of Pueblo Viejo, Mexico, Saturday, Oct. 4, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Iguala | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:26 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 4:12 pm
Two gang hitmen linked to police admitted to killing 17 of 43 students missing in southern Mexico, prosecutors have said, amid fears the victims were among bodies found in a mass grave. Inaky Blanco, the chief prosecutor of violence-plagued Guerrero state, said on Sunday it would take at least 15 days to identify the 28 bodies in the clandestine grave, some of which were badly burned and in pieces.
READ: Mass grave found near Mexico town
The site was found Saturday in Pueblo Viejo, an impoverished district of the city of Iguala, where the missing students were last seen on the night of September 26, some 200 kilometres south of Mexico City. “A bed of branches and tree trunks was made, on which the bodies of the victims were laid and a flammable substance was used,” Blanco said.

The students disappeared after Iguala municipal police officers shot at buses transporting them, and Blanco said the Guerreros Unidos gang participated in a night of violence that left six people dead, 25 wounded and 43 missing. While the students are accused of having hijacked the buses, Blanco said the motive for the attack remains under investigation.
The case could become one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date, and by far the most horrific since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012.
Earlier yesterday, some parents and hundreds of fellow students from the missing group’s teacher training college blocked the highway between Guerrero’s capital Chilpancingo and Acapulco, voicing anger at the authorities. Survivors said the students had gone to Iguala to conduct fundraising activities and came under attack by police after they boarded three buses.

In all, three students were killed in the shooting and another three people died in an attack on a football team’s bus outside Iguala later that night. Blanco said police and gang members were involved in both crimes. Witnesses continued…

Are Googles search results manipulatedHere's The Evidence That Google's Search Results Are Horribly Biased
By Jim Edwards | Business Insider –  Thu 2 Oct, 2014 5:14 PM IST
>>
AP Photo/Kathy Willens Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman.
Yelp and a coalition of like-minded travel and shopping websites have created an elegant demonstration of the way they say Google biases search results in favor of Google's pages.
It's a Chrome browser extension that Yelp says strips Google+ pages from Google's search results, forcing the search engine to display only the "organic" results Yelp says Google would serve if it wasn't biased in favor of Google's own sites and links.
The device lets you compare Google's results with and without interference from Google+, the anti-Google coalition says. (We have a couple of screengrabs below demonstrating the difference.)
I n other words, it removes all those "Google Review" star-ratings that you often see under links to your search results. Yelp says that if Google didn't automatically put its own links there, then reviews on sites like Yelp and Tripadvisor would appear higher up the page.
For years, Yelp has complained that Google has moved its relatively unpopular Google Reviews and Google+ links to the top of supposedly "organic" search results, while links to sites like Yelp and Tripadvisor, which have thousands of reviews per venue, are shunted down into the search engine's equivalent of Siberia.
An internal document recently leaked from Yelp showed how the company believed Google was siphoning off up to 20% of its clicks, directing them to Google's results. Yelp even persuaded the European Union to reopen an antitrust investigation into the way it said  Google abused its 90% share of the European search market to manipulate results . (Business Insider heard Yelp's intervention came after CEO Jeremy Stoppelman found himself at a dinner in San Francisco this spring with EC president José Manuel Barroso , where he was able to bend Barroso's ear about Google's market share.)
So Yelp has launched a coalition, including Tripadvisor and Consumer Watchdog, under the banner "Focus On The User" to draw attention to the way Google results are displayed.
Business Insider contacted Google for comment but has not yet heard back. The company would likely point out that Google helps Yelp as much as it hurts Yelp. In fact Stoppelman praised Google on a recent earnings call, saying " we've seen actually an uptick as a result of the recent Google algorithmic change ."
The most interesting part of the coalition's work is the development of this widget that shows you what Google search results look like with and without Google+ links.
Here is what a "normal" search for "London Hotels" looks like: >
Business Insider
Note that the top organic result, for the Corinthia Hotel, has only 42 reviews on Google.
Now here is what you get if you strip out the Google+ results, so that Google returns only organic results based on its normal algorithm — in which Google+ results have to compete equally with everyone else's pages: >
Business Insider
Note that the Corinthia has 1,222 reviews on Tripadvisor.
Yelp argues that the Tripadvisor results are far more reliable than Google Reviews because there are more of them and because Tripadvisor specializes in hotel reviews and is the market leader for that type of information.
The implication is that because Google dumps its reviews on top of those, it is using its 90% market dominance to essentially interfere in the market for — in this case — hotels. That, possibly, is antitrust violation. Yelp isn't complaining that Google dominates search, rather that it is using that dominance to distort markets outside of the search industry.

India A 282 (Unmukt 101, Nair 64, Taylor 3-51) beat West Indians 266 for 9 (Ramdin 102, Holder 54, Kulkarni 3-39) by 16 runs
Unmukt ChandA century from Unmukt Chand , followed by a three-wicket haul by Dhawal Kulkarni helped India A to a 16-run victory against West Indians in Mumbai.
The visitors, though, had plenty of positives despite the close defeat, as Denesh Ramdin , Darren Sammy and Jason Holder all shone with fighting knocks down the order, after their pacers had done well to restrict India A.
Before the game, West Indians had struggled to even field 11 fit players; Sunil Narine had flown back to West Indies, Lendl Simmons had hurt his back during the previous warm-up game, and Darren Bravo was down with an upset stomach. It meant that the coach Stuart Williams was included in the team as the 11th man, and the former West Indies opener displayed his impressive fitness levels by fielding for more than half of India A's innings. He also faced two balls but failed to connect with either.
Having opted to bat, Unmukt and Karun Nair were threatening to take the game away from a four-pronged West Indians pace attack. While Nair was timing virtually every aggressive shot he went for, Unmukt recovered from a sluggish start to punish anything that was pitched short.
Once Nair was dismissed against the run of play - cutting a short and wide delivery straight to Blackwood at point - in the 28th over to end a 149-run stand, West Indians began to claw their way back. With Nair gone, Unmukt was shaky in his nineties. The captain Manoj Tiwary perished early, and with Sanju Samson also struggling to find his touch, Unmukt suddenly lost his timing. He was lucky to be dropped by Kemar Roach on 94. Unmukt eventually raised a scratchy, yet deserving, hundred, but Jerome Taylor cleaned him up soon after with a perfect yorker. That wicket triggered a collapse, as India A fell from 184 for 2 to 282 all out.
West Indians' chase began just as poorly as it had in the previous game. With Kulkarni and Jasprit Bumrah both striking early, West Indians soon slumped to 65 for 4 and were facing another massive defeat.
However, Ramdin, who had claimed five catches behind the wicket earlier in the day, counterattacked in the company of Sammy. The pair added 101 before Sammy mistimed a pull off Kulkarni soon after scoring a half-century, giving the keeper Sanju Samson a simple grab. Ramdin pushed on. With 93 required off the last 10 overs, Tiwary brought Karn Shamra on to stem the flow of runs, but Ramdin went after him, plundering 17 runs off his over.
Ramdin eventually collected his third List-A hundred - a run-a-ball 102 - but his dismissal off Nair in the 45th over pegged the team back. Holder was in good touch, driving Parvez Rasool and Nair for assured boundaries, but with 42 needed off 24, he was left with too much to do in the end.
Following two more immaculate overs from Kulkarni, that equation was turned to 23 needed off six balls. Holder began the final over with a six, but two wickets in the next three balls meant that West Indians fell 17 short.
Despite being ravaged by injuries, West Indies should be in a much healthier position by the time the ODIs begin in Kochi. Sulieman Benn is expected to join the squad by Wednesday, as are Dwayne Bravo , Dwayne Smith and Andre Russell , who all played in the Champions League Twenty20 final in Bangalore.

Coal India Awards Contracts for 2 Washeries
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 06, 2014 15:40 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
New Delhi: State-owned Coal India has awarded contracts for construction of two washeries as part of efforts to augment its capacity to crush coal and ensure better quality of the dry fuel.
The government had earlier said that comprehensive measures for enhancing domestic coal output were being put in place along with stringent mechanism for quality control and environmental protection, which includes supply of crushed coal and setting up of washeries.
"CIL (Coal India Ltd) has initiated action through global tenders to establish 16 coal washeries with an aggregate capacity of 100.6 Mt... Construction job of three washeries are in progress and the same for two washeries have been awarded," Coal India said in a report.
It added: "Jobs of other washeries are in different stages of evaluation."
Of the 16 coal washeries, six are coking coal with a capacity of 18.6 million tonnes per year and 10 non-coking coal washeries with a capacity of 82 million tonnes per year, it said.
At present, CIL operates 17 coal washeries with a total capacity of 39.4 million tonnes per year. Out of these, 13 are coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 24.90 million tonnes, while four are non-coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 14.50 million tonnes, it added.
The Standing Committee on Coal and Steel had earlier pulled up Coal India for delays in setting up of washeries and had desired that the coal PSU prepare an action plan to expedite the work of commissioning of washeries.
The committee had also observed that the washeries were not set up despite the Ministry of Environment and Forests restricting the use of coal containing more than 34 per cent ash content in power stations located 1,000 km away from pit heads.

Samsung Makes $14.7 Billion Bet With New Chip PlantYou are here: Home Corporates
Samsung Electronics Makes $14.7 Billion Bet With New South Korean Chip Plant
Reuters | Updated On: October 06, 2014 14:33 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
Seoul: South Korean IT giant Samsung Electronics plans to spend $14.7 billion on a new chip facility - its biggest investment in a single plant - leaning on its semiconductor business to bolster profits as its smartphone dominance wanes.
Samsung, the world's top memory chip maker, said the plant would be located in Pyeongtaek, roughly 75 kilometres (47 miles) south of Seoul. The company said it would create 150,000 jobs, equal to about a third of the city's population.
The bet on chips comes as its smartphone business is being squeezed by Apple Inc in the premium segment and undercut by Chinese rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd in mid-to-low end. April-June operating profit for Samsung's mobile division fell in annual terms for the second straight quarter, the longest streak since at least 2011.
But with the higher demand for mobile devices comes increased orders for mobile chips, and Samsung Electronics' semiconductor division will be key to propping up the company's bottom-line, analysts say.
The plant in Pyeongtaek will make either logic or memory chips, Samsung Electronics said, adding that a final decision had not been made yet.
"Right now the only part of the company that is bringing in steady profits is the semiconductor division, so it looks like the company will keep investing in the business," said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee.
The chip business is likely to be a lone bright spot in what is otherwise expected to be a poor third quarter for the South Korean giant. Samsung will issue its earnings guidance for the period on Tuesday.
The mean forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 42 analysts calls for the firm's July-September operating profit to come in at 5.6 trillion won ($5.24 billion), its weakest performance since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Some analysts forecast that the semiconductor division will report stronger operating profit than the handset division in the third quarter for the first time in more than three years. The chip business recorded a 1.9 trillion won profit in the second quarter, compared with 4.4 trillion won for the mobile business.
The company's global smartphone market share has declined in annual terms in the past two quarters, according to Strategy Analytics, in step with the profit drop at its mobile division.
Shares of Samsung Electronics closed 0.9 per cent higher on Monday, compared with a 0.4 per cent decline in the broader market.
Glut concerns
Samsung Electronics said its chip production capacity was expected to rise by a "low double-digit percentage". Construction of the new plant is scheduled to be completed by the second half of 2017.
Any capacity increase can be ominous for competitors in a deeply cyclical industry. Shares in domestic rival SK Hynix Inc fell more than 8 per cent at one point on Monday after Samsung's announcement.
Market conditions for memory chips have remained favourable this year partly due to stronger-than-anticipated demand from personal computers and servers. Industry players like Samsung Electronics have so far been careful about capacity expansion, keeping supply conditions on a tight leash.
Besides SK Hynix Inc, competitors in the memory industry include Micron Technology Inc and Toshiba Corp.
"While the plant won't enter production until 2017, Samsung's investment plan hurts sentiment because it suggests that Samsung wants to make further market share gains," IM's Lee said.
Some analysts said investors may be over-reacting on SK Hynix shares, given how output from the new Samsung plant won't materialise for several years and it is not yet clear what chips will be made there.
They also noted that the investment will be spread out over three years, keeping spending on the project well within Samsung's typical annual semiconductor-related investments.
"This isn't about Samsung trying to destroy the industry cycle but trying to maximise profits from the semiconductor business," CIMB analyst Lee Do-hoon said.
Pyeongtaek
The tech giant said it had brought forward its investment plan for Pyeongtaek by more than a year in response to calls from regional governments to help boost economic activity in the area.
"Samsung will continue to balance its domestic and foreign investments to ensure optimal global production structure," the company said.
Analysts said there could be practical benefits to having the new plant in relatively close proximity to other domestic chip plants as opposed to building one overseas. Some said building a new plant near Seoul makes it easier for the company to recruit local engineering talent as well.
"To some extent this is also a response to the current government's call for big corporations to invest domestically," said Korea Investment Trust Management fund manager Baik Jae-yer.
The government has proposed a tax on excess profits at big corporations in an effort to prod them to spend more on investment, wages and dividends.

Small tea growers seek policy help from CentreUpdated: October 6, 2014 22:19 IST
Small tea growers seek policy help from Centre
Indrani Dutta
agriculture
Small tea growers, who had already emerged as a potent force in boosting India’s tea output, have sought policy interventions from the Centre saying that support services were urgently needed, if the sector was to sustain its production levels.
The two lakh small tea growers now account for 35 per cent of India’s tea output which averages at over 1,000 million kgs. Their share was projected to increase to 50 per cent by 2020. Educated youth are now engaged in tea cultivation through self -help groups as first generation entrepreneurs.
The sector has urged the Centre to prepare a policy for floor price of green tea leaf sector, saying that price volatility was a major constraint for the sector, which was facing profit squeeze due to increased production costs.
In a letter written to the Union Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitaraman , the president of the Confederation of Indian Small Tea Growers Association, Bijoy Chakraborty, said that the small tea growers directorate set up by the Tea Board last year, has not been effective enough in either protecting the sectors interests, or providing it with the extension services that could help it improve its quality and yield. The sector was also facing problems regarding obtaining `no objection certificates’ from the state government. The letter pointed that although CISTA had played a crucial role in preparing the 12 plan proposal for STG, non-approval of the 12 Plan and the Tea Board’s financial crunch was affecting its growth.

Cost of power generation likely to increase ...Cost of power generation likely to increase by 33 per cent following Supreme Court order

Coal India
(Rating agency ICRA has estimated…)
KOLKATA: The cost of power generation is likely to increase about a third, according to industry estimates, as 36 coal blocks get transferred from private sector to state-run miner Coal India following a Supreme Court order.
Coal India's cost of production is more than that of private firms due to higher overheads and strict adherence to the rules requiring key postings in all of its mines, said a coal expert, who has worked with the miner in the past.
"Coal India also adheres to the minimum salary structure that needs to be paid to mine workers and in certain cases pays more than the minimum. We have estimated that the cost of production from most of its mines is at least 30% higher than that of private firms. This will be even higher for difficult terrains," said the expert, who did not wish to be named.
Rating agency ICRA has estimated that about 18 GW capacity of independent power producers will be affected by the Supreme Court order. This comprises a mix of operational projects (6.3 GW as of July) and under-construction projects (11.4 GW expected to become operational over the next two years).

Flipkart should focus on customers and not the competition
ARCHANA RAI, ET Bureau Oct 7, 2014, 04.43AM IST
Tags:
Alibaba
(The easy thing for Flipkart…)
Clearing up once the guests are gone after a gala party is a nightmare for even the most enthusiastic and organised host. For Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, the founders of Flipkart, who threw open their doors on Monday for a Diwali bash termed as "the sale to end all sales", tidying up could prove to be a nightmare to end all nightmares.
In the span of a single day, Flipkart has managed to tarnish a reputation built over seven years. The damage is not irretrievable but the poster boy of Indian online retail must first understand why it disappointed so many on Monday. In one word, it is hubris. With its present mindset, it will struggle against the might of Amazon, and Alibaba when the Chinese company starts selling here. Flipkart must clear its head first.
The easy thing for Flipkart to fix is the technical glitches. Despite planning for months, hordes of customers were unable to buy what they wanted at the advertised price. It is not uncommon for technology to trip up online retailers and Flipkart will not be the last one to have suffered this way. The next time will be much better, of that we can be confident.
The bigger worry for Flipkart is elsewhere. Let us illustrate this with a couple of examples. The first gripe with them is that they appear to be taking the customer for granted by billing what is essentially a clearance sale as a curated event. This should not have been done before Diwali, when customers make the biggest purchases of the year. The deals ought to have been specially created with the latest products in keeping with the spirit of the festival season. This would have also been a natural barrier against competition, which stole Flipkart's thunder with deep discounts on popular brands.
Of late, Flipkart has made an effort to launch its private-label electronics and accessories but has not made sufficient progress to distinguish itself. Its attention span has been limited, with the result that it seems to be spreading itself too thin. Buying Myntra was a smart move but it does not equip Sachin or Binny with the cloak of invincibility.
Amazon and Jeff Bezos are not babes in the wood. Which brings us to our final point. When Bezos was in India last week, there was a note of triumphalism from Flipkart.
Greeting the American entrepreneur with Flipkart billboards advertising today's sale along his route was pointless aggression. Sachin and Binny are role models for a generation of aspiring entrepreneurs and they should be conscious of this.
Flipkart has enjoyed sympathy among those who regard it as an Indian success story. Through relentless pursuit of operational excellence, Flipkart is where it is today. It was not the first online retailer in India, but is today the largest because it got the basics right. Flipkart should focus on the customer and not the competition. That should be the lesson from Black Monday.

Aditya Thackeray: New hope for Sena | MNS  Amit Thackeray being groomed for politicsAditya Thackeray
(Old timers recall how Bal…)
MUMBAI: When Shiv Sena was so completely sure of winning the 2014 polls along with its 25-year-old ally, the party—if some senior functionaries of Shiv Sena are to be believed—had even toyed with the idea of fighting the 2019 elections with Aditya Thackeray as chief minister of Maharashtra. Now, all those ideas need to be reworked. But, there is no doubt how important Aditya is to the party.
Even as a child, Aditya was interested in politics. Old timers recall how Bal Thackeray's eldest grandson would always be around for photo-ops when bigwigs of national politics came knocking at the doors of Matoshree. Old Shiv Sainiks remember seeing a an adolescent Aditya, always in the thick of action, offering tech tips to help his father Uddhav handle a new gadget or as he grew older get involved in animated discussions on politics.
Though there was no doubt about Aditya's place in Shiv Sena as Uddhav's political heir, his entry into the party was a rushed affair in 2010 after Uddhav and Shiv Sena were challenged by the cousin, Raj Thackeray , who split the party and founded the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in 2006. What rocked the Sena was the phenomenal support Raj had among the youth.
The Sena believed that Aditya could be an effective counter to Raj and undoubtedly the strategy has succeeded to a large extent. As the head of the Yuva Sena, Aditya, has managed to lure a large number of youngsters into the Sena. The 24-year-old has become so big in the family-run party that insiders say that he effectively controls the Sena and devises its strategy. For instance when BJP declared publicly that it was breaking its alliance with the Sena, it was not Uddhav, but Aditya who first responded on Twitter.
Aditya is supremely confident of his abilities and about the role that he has assumed for himself and hence, has already made a mark in the party. He has consciously nudged the party away from violence to have an image makeover and has strictly instructed Sena functionaries not any undertake violent agitations.
The Sena always drew its strength and sent political messages out through its strong local network of Shakhas spread across the state. But Aditya has taken the party beyond its shakhas to the cyber networks on "watsapp", twitter and other social media platforms. He supplemented the old political networking tools that his grandfather and the great grandfather Pabodhankar used with new age social networking tools. So, even the Michael Jackson song that plays on his mobile as one dials his number does not really come across as cultural shock for the Shiv Sainik or anyone else who engages with Aditya.
And his second cousin Amit Thackeray is one of the many who used to meet up with him frequently.

Chrysler Group is killing its Dodge Viper professional racing program.
And its' mulling whether to discontinue supporting Viper racers owned and piloted by individual customers.
The number of cars is infinitesimal -- two GTLM professional-series racers and five GTD individual-owned cars, three in North America and two in Europe.  .
But withdrawing manufacturer support from the Viper racers could dilute the high-performance Viper's image.
And it signals a significant shift in how the Chrysler Group's SRT unit will feed the Dodge brand's go-fast persona.
When it announced Monday the death of the road-racing program, SRT repeated a statement it made in May: SRT "will continue to be aligned with the Dodge brand, delivering SRT ultimate performance vehicles to complement the Dodge brand's mainstream performance vehicles."
Chrysler already sells high-profile SRT versions of its mainstream vehicles, such as the Dodge Charger SRT. It's unclear whether the brand could take the high-performance mantle and hardware deeper into the mainstream Dodge line.
Chrysler's decision means that the two factory-backed racers -- Nos. 91 and 93 -- no longer will be given money, hardware and technical help by the car company. Dodge will build no more of the non-street-legal dedicated Viper racers to field as factory-sponsored entrants.
If it also axes the individual-owner program, the five people who campaign similar, though not identical, Viper GTD cars would not get race-preparation help from Riley Technologies in North Carolina. The individual-owner race cars are $450,000 each.
"Our company has made a business decision to discontinue the SRT Motorsports Dodge Viper GTS-R racing program," said Ralph Gilles, senior vice president of product design, and SRT boss.
The cars race in what is a merged American Le Mans and Grand Am race series held on American tracks. The cars, with relatively minor modifications,a also  can race in European contest.
"We are very proud of the amazing achievements our fantastic teams, drivers and partners have achieved on track the last few seasons. We thank them for their hard work, effort and commitment to SRT Motorsports. It's been an honor to be a part of the inaugural IMSA TUDOR United SportsCar Championship season and we wish them every success in the future," Gilles said.
The 2014 race series in which the Vipers compete ended Oct. 4.
Automakers have been involved in factory-backed racing for decades, and they try to pick the racing series that will generate the most publicity and attract the biggest sponsor support -- such as NASCAR.
Many car companies have high-performance units. Ford has SVT, Toyota has TRD, Mercedes-Benz has AMG, BMW has M cars and Audi has R-series models.

The Future of Hong Kong
October 6, 2014
Nascent political movements are a little like the Hunger Games. The odds are almost never in the little guys’ favor, which is why we marvel at the fall of the Berlin Wall or the success of Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Last week, Jeff Bader, the Obama administration’s former top adviser on Asia, gave a stark prediction: Hong Kong protestors will almost certainly fail in their demands for universal suffrage. The reality, Bader told the Washington Post , is “Beijing is quite intractable.”
Bader’s assessment is brutal, but fair.
There are, however, pundits who lack Bader’s discernment, and confuse saying “it’s unrealistic” with “it’s absurd.” They sway readers by obfuscating two lines of thinking: Something is difficult to obtain, ergo, it is unworthy of attempt.
Martin Jacques’s piece “ China is Hong Kong’s Future, Not It’s Enemy ” is a classic in this vein. Its logic flows thus:
Hong Kong never had democracy as a British colony
The city has enjoyed more freedoms under Chinese rule than British, and more so than any city on mainland China
To ask for more is unrealistic, overreaching and flat out ungrateful
Writes Jacques: “Although Hong Kong came, over time, to enjoy the rule of law and the right to protest, under the British it never enjoyed even a semblance of democracy. It was ruled from 6,000 miles away in London. The idea of any kind of democracy was first introduced by the Chinese government.”
Let’s put this old saw to bed once and for all. China did not grant Hong Kong these freedoms easily or even willingly. Although Britain was shamefully slow in introducing democracy to Hong Kong—and remains shamefully mute on current proceedings—they were the ones who introduced the first elections in 1980s and greatly expanded them in the 1990s. China fought “tooth and nail” against this, said constitutional scholar and Basic Law expert Danny Gittings , issuing “repeated public warnings to Britain to slow down the introduction of democracy.”
After 1997, some aspects of the expansion of the electoral franchise introduced by Hong Kong’s last governor Chris Patten were rolled back. (Patten’s attempts to inject greater choice into Hong Kong’s system earned him charming sobriquets like “serpent” and “Whore of the East” from Chinese officials.)
People in Hong Kong understandably want a more balanced system now. Currently, special interest groups like the financial and real estate industries have a disproportionate amount of power in electing both Hong Kong’s leader and members of the Legislative Council.
Article 45 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, states: “The ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.”
This was a sop given to Hong Kong’s democrats, who fought hard for this concession. It was something Beijing grudgingly granted, after much wrangling, and was not present in the early drafts of the Basic Law.
At the heart of last week’s street protests are different interpretations of the phrase “broadly representative.” Lawyers can dance on the head of a pin debating this one out, but most reasonable people can understand why Hong Kong protestors might take issue with Beijing’s narrow interpretation: just two or three choices, pre-approved by Chinese authorities.
To understand the Hong Kong protests, we need to separate what’s realistic from what’s right. Clearly, Hong Kong’s protestors have an uphill slog. The possibility of Beijing making significant concessions are almost nil. But it doesn’t make for an intelligent argument to denigrate their goals or aspirations, or portray them as adolescents acting out. There are, of course, quite a lot of young protestors, but so far—though things may of course change—the peaceable, reasoned nature of the protests has been marked by a maturity not seen in Tahrir or Tiananmen.
This Wall Street Journal piece notes “pro-democracy protesters aren’t realists; they’re idealists. Besides, the college students don’t remember British days; high-schoolers weren’t even born then.”
Again with the childish trope, Martin Jacques suggests Hong Kong’s demands are rooted in old-fashioned jealousy. Hong Kong, he says, “got rich because of China,” which fed “an attitude of hubris and arrogance.” Now that the Chinese economy has grown so much, “Hong Kong has lost its role as the gateway to China.”
In his portrayal of the Hong Kong-China relationship, China is clearly the more mature partner, so far tolerant of the city’s sullen, teenage behavior. “The Chinese have persisted with what can best be described as a hands-off approach,” he writes. (Which is hardly true.)
Singapore’s Foreign Affairs minister K. Shanmugam notes Beijing’s proposal is “more than what Hong Kong ever had under the British.”
If these pundits were writing about the women’s suffrage movement, they’d be saying: “Be grateful for shoes, not bound feet. What’s all this fuss about equal pay for equal work?”

Vishal Sikka to outline strategy at Infosys' Q2 results

Infosys
(It will mark the last time…)
BANGALORE: When Infosys declares its second quarter numbers this Friday it will attract a lot of investor and media attention for more than one reason.
For one, it will mark the last time cofounder Narayana Murthy , who returned more than two years ago to steady the ship, will be present when the company announces its results. Two, the management's commentary on business will be a primer for what to expect from results of other software exporters, including TCS and Wipro. Finally, its first nonfounder chief executive Vishal Sikka will outline his strategy to help Infosys retain its bellwether tag.
Although Infosys has stopped giving quarterly guidance, analysts believe that the company should comfortably record decent numbers that will help it retain its earlier annual guidance of 7%-9% for this fiscal. A weak rupee should also help the company record a marginal growth in its bottom line. Consequently, the company should better the 2% sequential growth for the first quarter ended June 30.
"Relative under-penetration of offshore delivery in infrastructure services keeps this a prime sector growth driver," CLSA analysts Ankur Rudra and Rohit Kadam said in a note last month. Infosys continues to see good traction in banking, financial services and insurance space, as well as manufacturing and telecoms.
Although there are some pockets of slowness in retail, clients continue to spend in America and Europe - two geographies that account for over two-thirds of Infosys' revenues.
However, street does not expect Infosys to announce addition of new large clients (50 million+) since Sikka took charge on August 1.
"So it will be interesting to see the impact of client mining (or getting new revenues from existing clients)," said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage.
Despite Sikka reaching out to employees more than once since taking charge on August 1, the company continues to battle high attrition rate. During the first quarter, attrition peaked at 19.5% and analysts and former company executives maintain that attrition for the quarter will remain high. For this reason, the Mumbai-based analyst pegs the attrition number to be at a high of 21-22%. Still, the consensus is that the company should be able to arrest this exodus of employees by the end of the third quarter ending December.
However, one headwind facing almost all IT firms has been slow growth in new deals being signed.
"One peculiar thing during this quarter has been a lower number of contracts has come on board," said an executive at a large Bangalore-based IT firm, adding that it is a "secular trend" witnessed across sectors.
Nonetheless, Infosys could see some headwinds in its BPO service line and core banking product, Finacle as many banks holding back on investing in integrated solutions.
For this reason, Sikka's strategy, including Infosys positioning in social, mobile, analytics and cloud, and the roadmap for the recently spun-off products, platforms and solutions business, Edgeverve will be crucial.
To be sure, the company has already extended the time it will spend to brief analysts about its new strategy from sixty to ninety minutes. Though the new CEO is expected to continue with Murthy's initiatives, including cost optimisation, sales effectiveness and delivery effectiveness, Sikka is expected to "double" Infosys investment in Intellectual property-led revenues and its Finacle.
After Sikka's key note address at Oracle event last month, Tony Baer, IT analyst with London-based research firm Ovum tweeted: "Interesting seeing Vishal Sikka discuss new role & vision for IT svcs (services). Formerly rebel in disguise at SAP, let's see if history repeats." It needs to be seen if Baer and other experts' hope is answered by Sikka.

Indian economy to grow by 6.4% in 2015-16: World BankIndian economy to grow by 6.4% in 2015-16: World Bank
Press Trust of India | Washington Oct 07, 2014 07:45 AM IST
Indian economy, which accounts for 80% of South Asia's output, is set to grow by 6.4% in 2015-16 as against 5.6% in 2014-15, the World Bank has said.
With economic activity buoyed by expectations from the new elected government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, "India is benefiting from a 'Modi dividend'," the Bank said in its twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus report yesterday.
Over the next year or so economic growth should be supported by the recovering US economy that would provide a market for Indian merchandise and service exports, it said.
"The outlook over the next years for South Asia indicates broad economic stability and a pick-up in growth with potential risks concentrated on the fiscal and structural reform side," said Martin Rama, Chief Economist for South Asia at the World Bank.
"Future growth will increasingly depend on strong investment and export performance," he added.
Private investment is expected to pick up thanks to the government's business orientation, and declining oil prices should boost private sector competitiveness.
But economic reforms will be needed for India to achieve its full long-term growth potential, the report argued.
The report said the region's economy will expand by a real 6% in 2015 and by 6.4% in 2016 compared to 5.4% this year, potentially making it the second fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific.
Other countries in the region are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The Bank said India's long-term growth potential remains high due to favourable demographics, relatively high savings, and policies and efforts to improve skills and education, facilitate domestic market integration and incentivize manufacturing activities.
In the medium term, with the economy still below potential and reforms on a gradualist path, growth is expected to accelerate from 5.6% in 2015 to 6.4% and 7% in 2016 and 2017.
Inflation is expected to decline with monetary policy switching to inflation targeting while the current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat as import demand and capital inflows rise.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue with stronger revenue mobilisation, while the oil subsidy burden could decline to 0.6% of GDP if benign global crude prices persist, it said.
Supply chain delays and uncertainty are a major yet under-appreciated constraint to manufacturing growth and competitiveness in India, it said.

Associated Press | Mursitpinar | Posted: October 7, 2014 9:40 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 1:17 pm
Islamic State fighters backed by tanks and artillery pushed into an embattled Syrian town on the border with Turkey on Monday, touching off heavy street battles with the town’s Kurdish defenders.

Hours after the militants raised two of their Islamic State group’s black flags on the outskirts of Kobani, the militants punctured the Kurdish front lines and advanced into the town itself, the Local Coordination Committees activist collective and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

“They’re fighting inside the city. Hundreds of civilians have left,” said Observatory director Rami Abdurrahman. “The Islamic State controls three neighborhoods on the eastern side of Kobani. They are trying to enter the town from the southwest as well.”

The center of the town was still in Kurdish hands, Abdurrahman said. Kurdish officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
Since it began its offensive in mid-September, the Islamic State group has barrelled through one Kurdish village after another as it closed in on its main target — the town of Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab. The assault has forced some 160,000 Syrians to flee and put a strain on Kurdish forces, who have struggled to hold off the extremists even with the aid of limited U.S.-led airstrikes.

(The 50-share Nifty index…)
MUMBAI: Disappointing economic numbers from Europe, continuous selling of Indian equities by global funds, uncertainty ahead of second quarter corporate earnings and increasing market volatility spooked Dalal Street on Tuesday as traders sold shares in key sectors such as capital goods, metals and pharmaceuticals.
The BSE Sensex slumped 296 points, or 1.11%, to end the day at 26,271 points; the index had corrected over 1,000 points in less than a month after it had hit a record high on September 8. While the NSE Nifty tumbled 93 points, or 1.17%, to close at 7,852 points, just above the crucial technical support level of 7,850. European markets posted losses on Tuesday afternoon after the industrial output in Germany slumped 4% in August, well below the forecast of a drop of 1.5%, which reaffirmed that the Eurozone's largest economy is losing steam.
"Selling pressure on DSteet intensified after Germany's industrial output numbers posted its worst decline in over five years. Investors are now waiting for the US Federal Reserve comments on interest rate hikes, which is scheduled to be released on Wednesday," said Sanjeev Zarbade, VP-private client group research at Kotak Securities.
Overseas investors sold Indian shares worth Rs63.24 crore on Wednesday, provisional exchange data showed. International investors have been sellers on six occasions out of the last seven, where they have sold equities worth about Rs2,300 crore. "There has been a lull in foreign fund flows for the last 7 to 10 days because of the volatility in global liquidity. We have seen a bit of volatility even in the forex market where the dollar has appreciated against most currencies," said Sanjay Dongre, fund manager at UTI Asset Management.
The rupee ended the day at 61.43 to a dollar on Tuesday against its previous close of 61.61. "Our view is that as we head into the results season, the results are going to be a little disappointing compared to the current valuations and expectations," said S Krishna Kumar, head of equity at Sundaram Mutual Fund.

Bilt Paper is also exploring the possibility of listing of its shares at an overseas Stock Exchange, the company said.
The subscription of shares is subject to fulfilment of conditions set out in the definitive documents, it said.
In June, Ballarpur had said that BPBV is evaluating and exploring options with IFC for receiving potential investment from IFC, in a combination of debt and/or equity in BPBV and or its step down subsidiaries, PTI reported.

Bay of Bengal likely to witness a strong cyclone by weekend  say forecastsDepression materialises in the Bay, set to become a cyclone
Vinson Kurian

Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 7:  
The well-marked low-pressure area over north Andaman Sea has concentrated into a monsoon depression this afternoon, an India Met Department update said.
It will move in west-northwesterly direction and further intensify into a deep depression by tomorrow (Wednesday) and thereafter as a tropical cyclone.
TROPICAL CYCLONE
It will cross the Andaman and Nicobar Islands tomorrow and set itself on a course for the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coasts as a tropical cyclone.
It will have enough time and space to ramp up into a severe or even a very severe cyclone, according to a few international models.
The US Navy’s Joint Typhoon Warning Centre upgraded to ‘medium’ the possibility of a ‘significant tropical cyclone’ spinning up in the Bay in the next 24 hours.
Over the mainland, isolated heavy rainfall is forecast for the rest of the day over south interior Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry.
Weather over Andaman and Nicobar Islands may deteriorate tomorrow with the expected crossing of the cyclonic storm.
HIGH WINDS, HEAVY RAIN
Gale-force winds have been forecast reaching 70- to 80 km/hr, and fishermen have been directed not to venture out into the sea.
Isolated heavy rainfall would continue to lash south interior Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.
Squally weather has been forecast for the Nicobar Islands on Thursday as the cyclonic storm steps out into the open Bay of Bengal towards the east coast of mainland India.
Meanwhile, southern and southwestern Myanmar (especially the Ayerawaddy river mouth) also may get lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall during this phase.
The cyclone, to be named ‘Hudhud’ (contributed by Oman) as per protocol, is now expected to cross mostly the Odisha coast by the weekend, suggests a Met outlook.
A few international models indicate that the system might take a more southerly track towards north coastal Andhra Pradesh.
STRONG CYCLONE?
For instance, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The Centre seems to have lately shed its inhibitions about the extent to which the storm might strengthen.
It sees a strong to very strong system (severe to very severe cyclone) impacting the Andhra Pradesh coast by Saturday.
Back home, the Met sees the southerly-to-southeasterlies wrapping into the Bay system bringing heavy rain initially to Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha coasts from the weekend.
The building cyclone would be the first ahead of the onset of the northeast monsoon, which is likely to be declared along the time of, or shortly after, the landfall.
As if on cue, the withdrawal of incumbent southwest monsoon is gathering pace over mainland India as the peninsula gets covered during the next few days.
It is already knocking at the doors of the peninsula, having reached Hoshangabad, Malegaon and Dahanu this afternoon.

Mumbai, Oct 7:  
The rupee ended 19 paise higher at 61.42 against the previous close of 61.61 on the back of dollar sales by banks and exporters.

In intra-day trade, the domestic unit rose to a more than a one-week high of 61.30 and touched a low of 61.48.

Sensex falls 106 pts in early trade on weak Asian cuesSensex tumbles to 2-month low, down 296 points on capital outflows
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 7, 2014  | 16:36 IST

BSE benchmark Sensex on Tuesday plunged 296 points to close at nearly two-month low due to widespread losses in metal, healthcare, consumer durables and capital goods sector stocks on capital outflows and retail investors ahead of earnings season amid a mixed trend overseas.
After opening 137 points lower, the 30-share index continued its slide to touch the day's low of 26,250.24 before ending the day at almost two-month low of 26,271.97, a level not seen since August 14, registering a steep fall of 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
The gauge had lost 62.52 points in the previous session on October 1. Stock markets remained closed on October 2, 3 and 6 for Gandhi Jayanti, Dussehra and Id-Ul-Zuha, respectively.
FII/FPIs pulled out Rs 63.24 crore from domestic markets on October 1, according to exchange data.
Similarly, the broader-based NSE Nifty closed down by 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent at 7,852.40 after shuttling between 7,943.05 and 7,842.70.
Brokers said the sentiment dampened on foreign capital outflows and offloading of positions by retail investors ahead of the earnings season, with Infosys posting results later this week.
Of the 30 Sensex shares, 23 closed lower led by Hindalco (down 4.35 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (4.32 per cent) and Cipla (3.67 per cent), while NTPC, Gail and Tata Motors remained major gainers.
Globally, a mixed closing on the other Asian markets and a lower opening of the European stocks as a report showed German industrial production contracted the most in more than five years, also negatively impacted sentiment. Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 63.24 crore last Wednesday as per the provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
Sectorwise, BSE metal index suffered the most by falling 2.65 per cent, followed by healthcare by 1.85 per cent. Captial goods index by 1.78 per cent, Consumer durables index by 1.72 per cent, Realy index 1.27 per cent, PSU index 1.20 per cent and Banking index 0.87 per cent.

Indiana aid worker captured by Islamic State says in a letter is afraid to dieIn this 2000 photo provided by the Kassig Family, Abdul-Rahman Kassig poses for a photo with his mother, Paula Kassig, at Cumberland Falls State Resort Park near Corbin, Ky. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Indianapolis | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:16 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 2:10 pm
An Indiana aid worker threatened with beheading by the Islamic State group said in a June letter that he’s afraid to die and is saddened by the pain his captivity must be causing his family, his parents said Sunday.
In a statement released to media, Ed and Paula Kassig said their 26-year-old son, Abdul-Rahman Kassig, thanked them for their strength and commitment. And he appeared to try to prepare them for his death.

“I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all,” Kassig said in the letter, according to his parents. “I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through. If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.”

Kassig was taken captive by the Islamic State group Oct. 1, 2013, in Syria, where he was providing aid for refugees fleeing that country’s civil war.
The group said in a video after the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning last week that Kassig would be next. The Kassigs pleaded for their son’s freedom in a video statement released Saturday.

NRI  PIO  OCI: Clearing the air on cardsOctober 6, 2014, 2:49 am IST Ishani Duttagupta in Global Indian | World | ET

The euphoria among the Indian community in the US over the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is now over and it’s time to take stock of what his policy announcements really mean for them. To start with, a difference between non-resident Indians, overseas citizens of India and people of Indian origin – or NRIs, OCIs and PIOs – needs to be clear. The PM’s announcement about a lifetime visa and exemption of registration with police authorities during long-term stays in India for PIOs followed by the home ministry notification on the subject now ensures that PIOs, who are foreign citizens of Indian origin or their spouses, will have the same benefits as overseas citizens of India (OCIs), who have at some time been citizens of India. This, along with Mr Modi’s other related announcement on the merger of the two cards, was not surprisingly greeted with huge cheering from the PIO community in America, many of whom were present at Madison Square Garden to listen to his speech. “Prime Minister Modi has avoided the confusion between the two cards and the lifelong visa announcement will now provide freedom to the PIOs from having to deal with the long, arduous, expensive and often frustrating process of availing themselves of Indian consular services,” says Sanjay Puri, chairman of the US Indian Political Action Committee. British parliamentarian and entrepreneur Karan Bilimoria, who is a member of the Prime Minister’s Global Advisory Council, too, is upbeat about the announcement on merging the PIO & OCI schemes. “I had put up this proposal to the Indian government a couple of years back and we had discussed the merger of the two cards as a step towards streamlining the scheme,” he said. And while the strong policy direction by PM Modi is being welcomed by the PIO community around the world, there are some details and clarifications that still need to be ironed out. “The previous Indian government had also proposed to combine the PIO and OCI schemes as has now been announced by PM Modi. But we have made some suggestions to the Indian government about the merged card and hope that those will be looked into before the final policy change is announced,” says Ashook Ramsaran, president of the Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin (Gopio), who is a PIO himself. Gopio had, in fact, submitted its detailed suggestions to Kiren Rijiju, Union minister of state for home affairs, when he visited New York earlier in September. “The new OCI card should ensure uniformity for everyone and address the problem of requirement of reissuance when passports of the holders are renewed after they turn 20 and 50 years of age,” adds Ramsaran. The other big problem that many PIOs face is of obtaining original documents to support their applications when applying for PIO cards. “The new combined scheme of OCI and PIO cards should take into account the emotional quotient for the Indian community overseas. It will take some time before ministries of home affairs, external affairs and overseas Indian affairs agree on the different aspects of the new card and we hope that the Indian government will invite us for our suggestions,” says Munish Gupta, director for liaison with the Indian government for Gopio. But unlike the PIOs, the NRIs in the US who are there on work permits are disappointed because immigration issues were not discussed between PM Modi and US President Barack Obama. “The US Senate’s immigration reform Bill has a few provisions that would hurt India’s IT industry. These were not discussed between the two leaders which is somewhat disappointing for the Indians living in the US on work permit visas such as H1Bs and L1s,” says Chicago businessman Shalabh Shalli Kumar, founder of the National Indian American Public Policy Institute, a think tank. New Jersey-based filmmaker Meghna Damani, too, is disappointed that the issue of employment for dependent spouses of H1B visa holders was not brought up. “The department of homeland security’s proposed Bill to allow employment for certain dependent spouses is currently under review. It would have been very helpful for thousands of women on H4 visas if the Indian PM had discussed this issue with President Obama,” she said.

US NRIs not welcome in Indian financial businessUS NRIs not welcome in Indian financial business
Oct 6, 2014, 04.12AM IST
(Some mutual funds’ websites…)
By Dhirendra Kumar
American NRIs who invest in India are up in arms that since April this year a large number of Indian mutual funds have stopped accepting investments from them. Some mutual funds' websites explicitly say so, while others have opted for quietly discouraging any such investors that turn up. And this sudden unwelcome attitude towards a formerly favoured class of investors is not limited to fresh mutual fund investments.
Some mutual funds are said to be preparing to weed out existing NRI investors, and something similar is going on with stock brokerages, banks and even some real estate developers. Predictably, many NRIs are protesting through various channels, both formal and informal, to the financial institutions which are suddenly treating them as pariahs as well as to the government. Unfortunately, even though the situation may improve, it is unlikely to go back to the way it used to be in the good old days. Regardless of the fervour they displayed at Madison Square Gardens (MSG), the days when US-based NRIs' investments were welcome everywhere is over for good.
The reason it won't change is that this issue is much broader than just NRIs or India. From April this year onwards, under a new US law, it has become extremely onerous for any financial institution around the world to deal with 'US persons', which includes US citizens, green card holders and some other types of people and entities. Broadly, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) makes it compulsory for all Financial Institutions in the world to report to the US Government comprehensive details of all transactions involving these 'US persons'. The obvious question is so what? What authority does the Unites States Government have to force businesses in other countries to do its bidding? But if you think about it, the answer is also obvious. Legally, the US Government has no actual authority.
However, what it does have is a big (financial) stick with which it is willing to beat up anyone in the world who doesn't do what it says. If a financial company doesn't collect and report this data to the US government, and it has any assets in the United States, then the US Government will confiscate 30% of those assets as a withholding tax. This also applies to any connected business — what we would call a group company. Of course a confiscation of 30% of assets would utterly destroy any financial business.
From what I've learned, the problem is that complexity and cost of compliance is considerable, and the punishment for making a mistake is huge. Therefore, what FATCA boils down to is that if you have any intention of ever having any financial dealings in the United States, then you need to work as an unpaid tax collector for Uncle Sam, chasing down its citizens around the world. Take it or leave it. As I said earlier, FATCA is far more than an NRI or India issue, but it does have a large impact on India.
The root cause is that the US is apparently one of the only two countries in the world that has citizenship-based taxation rather than residency-based taxation. FATCA has had a huge impact on the desirability of having Americans as customers by financial businesses around the world and NRIs in India are no exception. The curious thing is that according to the official database that one can download from the US Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) website, more than four hundred Indian entities have signed an agreement of compliance with the IRS. This even includes some real estate developers.
However, anecdotal reports suggest that many, even some of the ones who have signed up, are turning down business from US citizens. It looks likely that many financial businesses will sign the compliance agreements with the IRS, but may still avoid US citizens in order to avoid the cost, complexity and risk of reporting. At best, they'll limit themselves to dealing with a handful of lucrative accounts. That'll be a problem for a huge number of NRIs. Unfortunately, the solution to the problem lies not in New Delhi or Mumbai, but in Washington DC.

Visa on arrival for American citizens may boost tourismVisa on arrival for American citizens may boost tourism
By Himanshi Dhawan, TNN | 6 Oct, 2014, 09.41AM IST
US is the largest source of foreign tourists to India, accounting for a share of 15.8% tourists which proves 'visa on arrival' makes good economics.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: The Modi government's decision to extend 'visa on arrival' to US citizens is not just an emotional pitch but makes good economics too. US citizens happen to be the topmost spenders among foreign tourists.
Analysis of tourism ministry and UNWTO data by think-tank Swaniti show that the US citizens are one of the higher spenders in the world with per capita spending at $1350 in 2012. It's no wonder that India is keen to woo them too.
India received about 6.6 million foreign tourists in 2012 which increased to about 6.9 million in 2013. US is the largest source of foreign tourists to India, accounting for a share of 15.8% or about 1 million tourists. Incidentally, 46% of the tourists traveling from the US come to visit family and friends and spend on shopping, travel and medical treatment among other things.
While much is made of India's low ranking (it ranks 40th in total foreign tourist arrivals globally) beaten by smaller countries like Thailand and Singapore, the country attracts travelers with deep pockets. We draw one-twelfth of France's 83 million but rank second only to Australia globally when it comes to per capita spending in the destination country. In fact the per capita spending by foreign tourists in India has increased from $2509 in 2010 to $2732 in 2012.
However, per capita spending by tourists in Australia is about double the amount and has increased steadily. Tourists in Australia spent $4909 in 2010 which increased to $5260 in 2012. Australia and India are followed by United States , Switzerland and Japan where tourists spend most. Tourists traveling to US spent $1893 in 2012 up from $1724 in 2010. Travelers in Switzerland shelled out $1707 in 2010 as compared to 1865 in 2012 while those traveling to Japan spent $1744 in 2012 as compared to 1533 in 2010.
India's visa on arrival scheme has been a slow starter. During January-July 2014, a total number of 14,415 VoAs were issued as compared to 10,482 VoAs during the corresponding period in 2013 registering a growth of 37.5%. The countries being offered the facility include Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Finland, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Luxembourg, and Laos. India plans to add 40 more countries with the US being one of them.

Let all voices be broadcast on DoordarshanOctober 6, 2014, 12:14 am IST ET Edit in ET Editorials | India , Times View | ET
13
Live broadcast of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat’s founding day address over the national public service broadcaster Doordarshan (DD) amounts to misuse of office by the government. Criticism of the broadcast has been widespread, but confused. Many have condemned the move because of the ideological strain that the RSS represents.
More germane is the propriety of devoting taxpayer-funded DD’s airtime to live telecast of one non-government organisation’s proceedings. Highlights of the speech would constitute legitimate news, but broadcast of the entire speech live amounts to converting the national broadcaster into the propaganda channel of one particular organisation.
This is wrong. The RSS was created on Vijaya Dashami in 1925. Ever since, that day has been commemorated by its cadres with speeches and other celebrations. But it is surprising that soon after the Narendra Modi-led BJP government came to power in May, the RSS foundation day speech has to be broadcast live by the state-owned and taxpayer-funded DD News. If that is to be the norm, let other organisations like the National Cadets Corps, founded in 1948, the Border Roads Organisation (1960), the Politburo of the CPI(M) (1964) and the leadership of the Congress (1885) also get equal time on the national network.
After all, nothing privileges the RSS over these organisations apart from the fact that it is the parent of the ruling BJP. In fact, if this trend is to continue, regional parties like the DMK, AIADMK, TMC, BSP, SP and the rest should also get equal time on the national broadcaster.
After all, it is the taxpayer, from all over the country — not just the RSS shakha member — who pays the salaries at DD News. Let all voices, political or not, be broadcast real time on the national network.

National School Safety Policy may propose two doors for schools
Aman Sharma, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 04.26AM IST

(A National School Safety…)
NEW DELHI: A National School Safety Policy , in its final stage of preparation, may soon propose that each school classroom should have two doors instead of one for faster evacuation and schools must not be granted or renewed recognition if they do not comply with the safety norms for preventing a disaster.
The NDMA has prepared a draft policy for schools across the country which will take forward a pilot project launched earlier in 200 schools of 43 districts each in 22 states.
"The District Education Officer must ensure that 'Recognition Certificate' under subrule (4) 15 of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory EducationRules, 2010, is issued only to those schools that comply with safety norms laid out in the Building Codes. This compliance needs to be monitored on a regular basis. All existing as well as new schools need to confirm to safety standards as per the National Building Code, 2005," the draft school safety policy says.
Among the safety measures, the draft policy specifies that classrooms should have two doors for easy evacuation, only non-combustible, fire-proof, heat resistant materials shall be used in school construction and vertical expansion of existing schools shall not be carried out without a fitness certificate for the building from a certified civil /structural engineer.
It adds that school safety efforts need to take cognizance of all kinds of hazards that may affect the well-being of children and emergency equipment such as fire extinguishers and ropes need to be procured and maintained regularly by the school authorities.

Swachh Bharat: I feel honoured not to be invited  says Mani ShankarCongress
(According to Aiyar, the…)
NEW DELHI: Senior Congressman Mani Shankar Aiyar took a dig at his colleague Shashi Tharoor, saying unlike Tharoor who felt "honoured to accept the invitation" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be one of the nine chosen brand ambassadors of the Swachh Bharat campaign, he feels honoured not to be invited by Modi.
According to Aiyar, the national cleanliness campaign, launched by Modi on Gandhi Jayanthi day, "ignores the fundamental Gandhian proposition" on carrying out sanitation mission in India. "Although Shashi Tharoor felt honoured to be invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I am honoured not to be invited. Because, the Swachh Bharat campaign ignores the fundamental Gandhian proposition that it should be run through, and by the panchayats, in close association with gram sabhas," Aiyar told ET.
Aiyar, a former Union Cabinet Minister for Panchayati Raj, also argues that Modi's high-profile national campaign without the involvement of panchayats and gram sabhas, could reduce the sanitation campaign to mere tokenism and photo-ops for the Prime Minister.
"Ignoring the panchayats amounts to reducing the campaign to tokenism. For, after all, why has Modi not taken into consideration the vast amount of research literature which shows the biggest lacuna in the total sanitation campaign and the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan was the low motivation at the micro level of the community and the households to make toilets at homes and actually use them," he said.
Aiyar feels a sanitation campaign, driven entirely by the bureaucracy, could suffer from ignorance and prejudices. "As TR Raghunandan of Accountability Initiative recounts, when an Orissa government official was asked why people are relieving themselves on the roadside, the official's reply was 'people believe it is unhygienic to relieve themselves at home because God lives in the homes'. That's the kind of ignorance and prejudices that have to be tackled to achieve a Swachh Bharat," Aiyar said.

Eid celebrations in Kashmir a low-key affairPress Trust of India | Srinagar | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:26 pm
Eid-ul-Zuha celebrations were a low key affair in the Kashmir Valley on Monday as people observed austerity following last month’s devastating floods that left over 280 dead and property worth over Rs one lakh crore was destroyed.
Although Muslims made a beeline to Eidgahs, mosques and shrines to offer prayers, the usual fervour and zeal associated with the festival was missing.
The largest Eid congregation was held at Hazratbal Shrine where over 35,000 faithful, including Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, offered prayers, officials said.
The officials said 25,000 people gathered for Eid prayers in a school at Rajouri Kadal in the city. Reports of large congregations were also received from all district headquarters of Kashmir Valley, they said.
The sacrifice of animals such as sheep and goats as part of rituals of Eid-ul-Zuha, also known as Bakri Eid, was made by many devotees but the number of animals slaughtered this year was far less compared to previous years.
“Nearly 50 lakh people were affected by floods. I don’t think many of them would be in a position to offer sacrifice this Eid,” said Abdul Rehman, a flood victim from Jawahar Nagar locality.
With wide parts of Kashmir devastated by the ravaging floods last month, many locals decided to refrain from celebrating the festival this time around. Most locals abstained from purchasing new clothes for the festival, as is the practice on the occasion, and also avoided bursting firecrackers as part of celebrations.
Meanwhile, a minor law and order problem erupted after Eid prayers at Safa Kadal as a mob pelted stones at security personnel.
“The mob was chased away by using batons and normalcy was restored very soon,” a police officer said.
JKLF chairman Mohammad Yasin Malik, who had planned to offer Eid prayers at Lal Chowk along with businessmen and traders of the area, was taken into preventive custody by police ahead of the prayers.
Another separatist leader Shabir Ahmad Shah was placed under house arrest.
However, chairmen of both factions of Hurriyat Conference – Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq — offered Eid prayers at Hyderpora and Eidgah respectively.

Khushboo Sundar keeps option open; may join BJPBJP
(Prime Minister Narendra…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi tagged South Indian superstar Kamal Haasan as one among the nine in his Swachh Bharat challenge, but he wasn't the only Tamil star who was impressed.
Khushboo Sundar , former member of the DMK, also tweeted her support for the abhiyaan on the day of the launch, setting off speculation that the BJP may be her next political port of call. "#SwatchhBharat..it's the duty of every citizen to keep our Bharat clean...start with home...use dustbins... segregate recycling items.. don't dump," says her tweet on the issue, along with a couple of other RTs from the prime minister's twitter handle.
"I believe that it's a great campaign, and that we all should contribute since it is our Bharat we will be cleaning up," she told ET. "As for joining the BJP or any other political party, let me say that I'm no longer with the DMK, and am currently on a break from everything, to figure out what to do next," she said.
"I don't want to join anyone in a hurry and later find out that either we have an ideological mismatch, or there is no growth there. That's what happened in the last political party I joined," she said.
Sundar was a member of the DMK and had quit the party on June 16 this year after she found "the one-way path of hard work in the party" not to her liking. She also had differences with DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi's designated successor MK Stalin.
The state BJP, which has been on the lookout for suitably prominent faces to project, has not exactly been lukewarm, but have adopted a wait-and-watch policy. "In the past, we had pursued actor Sivakumar, and the prime minister had met with his son Surya as well. But nothing came of that," said the source.
PM Modi actively wooed Rajnikanth, but apart from wishing the party well, the superstar hasn't committed anything. The state is in a political vacuum with Jayalalithaa in jail and the DMK not exactly in fighting form. Sundar, like others, is also watching which way the tide will turn before 2016 when assembly elections are due.
"A lot of my plans depend on what happens in the run-up to the Assembly polls in 2016," Sundar said.

John O Keefe  Edvard Moser  May-Britt Moser win Nobel prize in MedicineProfessor Ole Kiehn, right, annouces at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm the winners of the 2014 Nobel Prize in medicine. (Source: AP)

British-American researcher John O’Keefe along with a Norwegian couple, Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser, on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how the brain navigates.
They won the coveted prize for discovering an “inner GPS” which makes it possible to orient ourselves in space, the jury said.
“The discoveries of John O’Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser have solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries,” it said.
A file photo of Norwegian scientists May-Britt and Edvard Moser. (Source: AP)
“How does the brain create a map of the space surrounding us and how can we navigate our way through a complex environment?”
In 1971, O’Keefe discovered the first component of this positioning system, finding a type of rat nerve cell in an area of the brain called the hippocampus that was specifically activated when the animal was at a given location in the lab.
This led to the creation of a map of the room in the rat’s brain.
More than three decades later, in 2005, a married couple, May-Britt and Edvard Moser, discovered another key component of the brain’s positioning system.
They identified a type of nerve cell that generates a coordinate system and allows for precise positioning and pathfinding.
The work has potential benefits in neuro-medicine, especially in Alzheimer’s, where the positioning circuits of the brain are frequently damaged at an early stage of the disease.
This is an undated photo issued by University College London (UCL) of professor John O’Keefe. (Source: AP)
“Knowledge about the brain’s positioning system may, therefore, help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss that affects people with this disease,” the jury said.
The winners will share the prize sum of eight million Swedish kronor (USD 1.1 million). Half will go to O’Keefe, and the other half jointly to the Mosers.
Last year, the honour went to James Rothman, Randy Schekman and Thomas Suedhof, all of the United States, for their work on how the cell organises its transport system.
In line with tradition, the laureates will receive their prize at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896.

OVL taking a relook at Ivory CoastOVL taking a relook at Ivory Coast
Kalpana Pathak | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 12:50 AM IST
After a decade, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the foreign exploration and production arm of the central government-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation  (ONGC), is again looking at Ivory Coast.
 A company official said they were currently evaluating three blocks in the San Pedro Basin and might take a stake in these through the West African nation’s national oil company, Petroci. Of the three blocks, two are offshore and one onshore. “We are still looking at the data. If we find these blocks hold enough potential, we might look at them seriously,” said a senior company official.
The official added Petroci was also offering it some stake in an onshore block. OVL would decide shortly on this.
EXPLORING AVENUES
Sept 2004: OVL made its first foray into the west coast of Africa, specifically Ivory Coast’s oil and gas industry, through an agreement with Vanco Energy Company of the US
With reserves of natural gas and recent offshore finds of oil and gas, Ivory Coast has become an important supplier of energy to the sub-Saharan region
So far OVL has participation in 35 projects located in 16 countries
If this goes through, this would be OVL’s second attempt at Ivory Coast, the English translation of Cote d’Ivoire, that country’s official name. OVL had in September 2004 made its first foray into the west coast of Africa, specifically Ivory Coast’s oil and gas industry, through an agreement with Vanco Energy Company of the US. OVL acquired 30 per cent  stake in an exploratory offshore block, after having negotiated for acquisition of 40 per cent — 10 per cent was offered as participating interest to Oil India Ltd (OIL). However, OVL and OIL encountered dry wells. The block was located in the San Pedro Basin, where Total, the French national oil company, has made discoveries.
With reserves of natural gas and recent offshore finds of oil and gas, Ivory Coast has become an important supplier of energy to the sub-Saharan region. Beside Petroci and France’s Total SA, the UK-based Tullow Oil and Anadarko Petroleum operate there.
In a bid to expand, OVL had last week also signed an agreement with Petroleos Mexicanos for cooperation in Mexico, the largest crude oil producing country in Latin America. The oil and gas sector there was recently opened for participation by foreign companies.
So far OVL has participation in 35 projects located in 16 countries. It currently produces about 160,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas daily and has oil and gas reserves of 637 million tonnes of oil equivalent.

Flipkart Big Billion Day sale a disaster Owner Mukesh Bansal disagreesFlipkart Big Billion Day sale a disaster? Myntra's Mukesh Bansal disagrees

E-commerce company Flipkart hosted on Monday what it claimed to be its biggest sale with massive discounts on a wide range of products. But the sale was far from being a hit. The sale went live at 8.00 am but the website crashed due to heavy demand. A large number of consumers complained of not getting order confirmations even after making payments. Some said they were not able to see items they added to their shopping cart. Reports said Flipkart stopped taking orders as its logistics team was unable to keep pace with the demand.

Can regional sentiment move the electorate?

election
For two key State parties, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Indian National Lok Dal in Haryana, the virtual absence of any coalition in the upcoming polls will help them gauge whether regional sentiment still moves the electorate.
In Maharashtra’s last five Assembly elections, the Sena polled between 15.94% and 19.97%, winning 44 to 73 seats in the 288-strong Assembly. In these elections, its ability to play the “Maharashtra for Maharashtrians” card and hold onto the Hindu vote — at the expense of the BJP — will determine its success. It has been in power in the State only once, in 1995, when it formed a government with the BJP.
In the last four Assembly elections in Haryana, the INLD (in 1996, it was part of the Samajwadi Party) secured 20.56 % to 29.61% of votes, winning nine to 47 seats in the 90-strong Assembly, the last in 2000, when it came to power.
Though a regional party, it draws its inspiration from the socialist movement and has a strong rural base. In this election, the memory of its founder, Chaudhary Devi Lal, is being invoked to get votes. Additionally, leaders from the erstwhile Janata Parivar — the Janata Dal (United), the Janata Dal (Secular) — as well as a NDA member, the Shiromani Akali Dal, will campaign for the INLD this time.
The Sena and the INLD, therefore, present a challenge for the Congress — currently ruling Haryana for a decade and for 15 years in Maharashtra till its recent split with the Nationalist Congress Party. The BJP hopes to leverage the Modi “magic” and the absolute majority it won in the Lok Sabha polls in these State elections.
The BJP’s electoral record in the two States is interesting. In Maharashtra, since 1990, after it forged an alliance with the Sena, it has polled 10.71% to 14.54%, winning 42 to 65 seats. In a four-corner contest, the BJP will have to get around 30%, or double its votes, to emerge as a clear winner.
In Haryana, the BJP polled 3.2% to 10.36% in the last five Assembly polls, winning two to six seats, the last in 2000 when it tied up with the INLD (in the wake of the 1999 Lok Sabha polls when the two together won all 10 LS seats in Haryana). Here, in a three-corner contest with the Congress and the INLD, the Haryana Janhit Congress a spoiler, the BJP will have to treble its votes to secure a simple majority.
For the Congress, the challenge is to stay where it is. In Haryana, in the last five Assembly elections, it has secured 20.82 % to 42.46%, winning 21 to 67 seats. In Maharashtra, in the last three Assembly elections, it has polled 21.01% to 27.2%, winning 69 to 82 seats in alliance with the NCP. In the two preceding elections in 1990 and 1995, the united Congress had got 38.17% (141 seats) and 31% (80 seats).
The LS polls saw the BJP climbing nationally from 18.8 % (2009) to 31% (2014), a 12% jump; the Congress plunged from 28.55% to 19.3%, a 9% fall. Since neither party has an electoral ally, can the BJP bridge the much larger gap it needs to in these State elections?

Two years  five countries  and 4 000 later: a Syrian Kurdish refugees journey homeTwo years, five countries, and €4,000 later: a Syrian Kurdish refugee’s journey home

It costs €400 ($500) to be smuggled out of Europe.
That’s how much Juan Sheikh Muslem, a 27-year-old Syrian Kurdish refugee, paid to leave Spain and return to Turkey on Sept. 25. Over the past two years, Muslem, a chemistry student and one of 3 million Syrians who have fled the country since the beginning of the civil war in 2011, has spent more than €3,000 ($3,800)—his entire savings—paying smugglers in order to reach Europe.
Now, paying just a fraction of that he has returned home.
Since Sept. 29, Muslem has been sleeping in a Turkish mosque in Suruc, just a few kilometers across the border from the Syrian city where he was born, Kobani (or Ayn-al-Arab in Arabic): the city, which could fall in ISIL’s hands any moment, is likely to become theatre to a terrible massacre .

In Suruc, Muslem has heard airstrikes every half-hour, sometimes more frequently. He is finally close enough to home to smell the rising smoke, feel the mortars fall, watch Kurdish soldiers battling black-clad members of ISIL in the distance.
Some 350 Kurdish villages in Muslem’s region have been invaded by ISIL as the terror group forces its way toward Kobani. In the past two weeks alone,  more than 300,000 Kurds  have fled, fearing for their lives.

The border between Syria and Turkey.
At least 150,000 of them have crossed the border into Turkey, where half of all Syrian refugees since 2011 live. Muslem, like many of the refugees who fled earlier, has come back to help the new arrivals.
Turkish-Syrian border, Sept. 2012
Muslem crossed the same border into Turkey back in 2012, after having been imprisoned for 45 days by the Syrian government for participating in a student protest in Raqqa, which is now an ISIL stronghold. “My home was so close to Turkey but there was no crossing point in 2012, because the Turkish government did not want Kurds,” he says. “So everyone had to go to Jarablus to cross.” At that point in the Syrian Civil War, it cost about $100 just to hire a driver for the 35km ride through al-Qaeda-controlled territory from Muslem’s home in Kobani to the nearest Turkish border crossing. ” There are professional cars that work like taxis,” he adds. “But there was little petrol then in Syria, so it was very expensive.”
Anyone who didn’t have a passport, says Muslem, could then skip the official border crossing and be guided beyond the border on foot through a minefield: “There were 200m of minefields. But the smugglers know how to walk around the mines.” That service, plus fare for an endless series of buses to cross the 1,192km to the other side of the country, says Muslem, was a bargain. “All you needed to come from Syria to Istanbul without a passport was 200 Turkish lira ($88).”
Istanbul, Sept. 2013 to Aug. 2014
In Istanbul, Muslem eventually found work as a trash collector on the Asian side of the city, and then moved into the European side to work at Zaman Kebab, a fast-food restaurant in the Aksaray neighborhood. While other young people planned for the cost of raising children, or buying a first home, Muslem learned to budget in terms of smugglers’ fares. “I want to go to Denmark or England,” Muslem told me in 2013. “But it’s very expensive.”
Black market passage from Istanbul into Europe was (and still is) a luxury reserved for the wealthy. “There are two smugglers that I know who want €10,000($12,628). For €10,000, I could get a passport with a picture that resembled me and a plane ticket to England, Denmark, Germany,” he said.
With his service-worker’s salary of only 900 Turkish lira (about $392) per month, Muslem quickly gave up on his plan of continuing his chemistry studies in the UK. Even with some financial help from his family, he calculated, the trip alone would require at least 20 years of waiting tables.
Headed for Algeria, August 2014
But by August 2014, after two years in Istanbul, Muslem had scraped together just enough money to make a run for North Africa:
€750 ($938) from Istanbul, Turkey to Oran, Algeria;
€300 ($375) to be smuggled from Oran to Nador, Morocco;
€1,000 ($1,251) 25 days waiting in Nador;
€850 ($1,063) to be smuggled into Melilla, Spain;

Melilla, Spain, Sept. 20, 2014
“At 5am, there are a lot of Moroccan people crossing into Melilla,” says Muslem. “I met my smuggler at the border, and I was squeezed in between them.” Suddenly he was in Spain. His plans did not extend beyond that. Muslem says he walked around Melilla unsure of what to do next. He met a friend on the beach and called his mom from his friend’s phone. But the friend told him that if he left “a footprint” in Spain, he could not move on to Germany or Denmark, referring to the European Union’s policy of processing asylum requests only in the first country where the asylum-seeker arrives.
“And then my mother told me that she and my father had left Kobani and were at the Turkish border,” he says. “And that they needed me to come back.” ISIL’s siege had already begun. Muslem slept that night in a public park, and then decided to return to Turkey. He bribed the Moroccan police €400 ($500) to let him back into Morocco, and paid an additional €600 ($750) for the flight to Turkey. On Sept 25, one month after leaving for Europe, Muslem landed in Istanbul and began making his way back toward Kobani.
Mursitpinar, Sept. 29, 2014
From the small Turkish town of Mursitpinar, Muslem can vicariously live the Kurdish battle for independence from only 700m away. After helping his parents move west through Turkey and settle in Istanbul, he has decided to stay at the border. In a selfie from Sept. 29, he holds up remnants of an ISIL mortar shot into Turkish territory, which killed a fleeing Kurdish civilian.

Obsession
Modinomics
October 7, 2014
Narendra Modi recently kicked off the “Swachh Bharat” or Clean India campaign . Needless to say, cleaning India’s public spaces is a mammoth project. To be realized within five years, the timeframe itself is a tacit acknowledgment of the mission’s complexity and enormity. And true to Modi’s reputation as a social media savant, the Clean India campaign is trying to leverage social networks to spread the message.
Leave aside the inconvenient fact that only 200 million of 1.25 billion Indians are online—presumably those citizens who are not online will be targeted through offline channels. Here, let’s just focus on the efforts to involve the netizens of India. The playbook for the Clean India campaign is based on the ALS ice bucket challenge, which proved to be a social media blockbuster. Will #MyCleanIndia campaign become a viral hit like the ice bucket challenge?
Generating a viral hit is indeed the holy-grail pursuit of marketers. The tactics they use are not just trial-and-error. Viral marketing is a much-researched and carefully studied field these days. It is not an exact science (yet) but drawing from theories of psychology, online communication, social networking behaviours and more, key principles are being established to understand why some messages and ideas spread like wild fire while others fail to take off.
Modi prefers mnemonics ( 3Ds , 4Cs , 5Ts ) to drive home his message. In similar fashion, here is a quick summary of viral marketing principles using 3Ms (Medium, Message, Messengers) and an assessment of whether the Clean India campaign in its current avatar can effectively exploit them.
Medium
For a campaign or an idea to spread rapidly, you rely on existing communication networks as much as possible. Think of this as “word of mouth” but on digital steroids.
In that respect, online social networks (and in India, Facebook) should be a no-brainer. You just post before and after videos or photos of a cleaning job and then invite (or tag) the others in your social graph to further spread it along the chain. In this respect, Modi (or his team) has done the right thing.
But where they get it wrong is in the number of friends to invite along the chain. More is not merrier—having to invite nine friends increases the cognitive effort on the user. Besides, the effect of social proof is diminished—you comply to a request if you see everyone else around you complying. In a group of nine, it is inevitable that a few won’t take it up—the burden of social expectation eases and the chain breaks.
Rather than nine invites, it’s a lot easier to invite two or three friends (who you know would not mind and will accept the challenge) and offers a greater chance of the chain continuing.
Messengers
Most people in a social network are passive consumers of information. But there are certain influential users who can shape opinion and drive adoption. They also generally tend to have a large number of followers who look up to them for signals. A viral marketer starts by identifying these influencers and brings them on-board.
The seed team of influencers for Clean India is drawn from diverse fields—entertainment (Priyanka Chopra, Salman Khan, the team of the TV series Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah and Kamal Haasan), politics (Shashi Tharoor, Goa governor and ex-BJP women’s wing president Mridula Sinha), sports (Sachin Tendulkar), business (Anil Ambani) and spirituality (Baba Ramdev).
It’s a good list—public figures with brand-name recognition and with social networks that do not have much of an overlap. My only quibble here is that some of them are not exactly active online users. And they are all mostly “uncles” and “aunts” from the point of view of young people on social media. Younger icons are missing in this list. But overall, it’s a good seed team of influencers (an A-minus, rather than an A-plus) and presumably others missing in the first round are likely to be roped in to do their bit.
Message
People are more likely to share or forward messages that have these characteristics—emotionally appealing, make them feel good, are exciting or fun and increase their social standing. If you wondered why the ice bucket challenge flooded your Facebook timeline, you now know why—it checks off all these criteria.
Cleaning a dirty place and then posting about definitely gives you bragging rights—it ups your social standing and makes you feel good. But unfortunately (for factors beyond anyone’s control), cleaning is not intrinsically fun or cool. This reduces its viral potential—unless there’s a fun twist or spin to the whole cleaning process.
Bottom line
The Clean India social media campaign means well, but it is likely to end up being a “nice try”. Even in terms of social media activity, it asks for a lot from the user and is also not much fun.
There will be initial spurts of activity but as currently envisioned, it is unlikely to approach the success of the ice bucket challenge.

RSS-BJP: Unmaking the Indian Republicprint
The country is ‘rejoicing’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘came, saw and conquered’ US visit. The PTI reporting of the Madison Square Garden event gave him ‘rock star celebrity’ status! He himself claimed credit, upon return, rhetorically asking: “Kya karan hai ki aaj America mein bhi Hindustan ka danka baj raha hai?” (What are the reasons as to why India’s trumpet is being blown in America?) [@ani_news, October 4].
Rewind to March 8, 1971. I was in New York as the Indian representative of the World Youth Forum. The city was full of excitement over “the fight of the century” at the very same Madison Square Garden. Cassius Clay, who after refusing the US ‘draft law’ to compulsorily serve in the US army had embraced Islam to become Muhammad Ali, challenged the reigning world heavyweight boxing champion, Joe Frazier. The two hitherto “undefeated fighters” combating to decide the “real” champion was hyped as “the event of the 20th century” that transcended boxing. “The fight” split the US down the middle. Rooting for Ali meant one was against the Vietnam war, and backing Frazier meant support to a “white conservative” America. Frazier won in a gruelling fight that lasted full 15 rounds. The news next day was Ali visiting “champion” Frazier, who was in the hospital, treating his wounds!
Likewise, the moment our prime minister returned to India having “conquered” the US, inviting them to invest in India — “Make in India” — US President Barack Obama in his weekly radio address to the nation said that “it was America and not India or China that was the most attractive investment destination in the world”! Whose trumpet is being blown, Mr Prime Minister?
However, our prime minister borrowed Obama’s practice of regular radio broadcasts to the nation. Upon return, he began this on October 3. ‘Officially’ this address was supposedly to mark Gandhi Jayanti. But October 3 was also Vijaya Dashami. The RSS, since its foundation, has always hoisted the saffron flag on Vijaya Dashami with the annual RSS sarsanghchalak’s address. Not to annoy the RSS, lest the PM is seen as also donning the mantle of the RSS chief, the country’s ‘autonomous’ Prasar Bharati shamelessly obliged to nationally telecast the RSS chief’s Vijaya Dashami address. Facile justifications notwithstanding, it is clear that the national broadcaster is now reduced to being the propaganda arm of the RSS/BJP.
In a secular, democratic India, where constitutionally all religions are treated as equal, with guaranteed rights to religious minorities, will Prasar Bharati now nationally broadcast speeches of the chiefs of the Jamaat-e-Islami, Khalistani or such other proponents? The RSS was banned following the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Likewise, the Jamaat-e-Islami was banned earlier. Khalistani and many other outfits that seek the dismemberment of India are treated as ‘anti-national’ organisations. Are we to legitimise such organisations/outfits by providing State patronage by broadcasting their leaders’ speeches? This is simply unacceptable as long as “We, the people” remain committed to our Constitution.
During the PM’s US visit, a so-called ‘Vision Statement’ appeared as a joint editorial by Obama and the PM in the Washington Post titled ‘Chalein Saath Saath: Forward together we go’. Chalein Saath Saath is the Hindi translation of a line from the famous anthem of the African-Americans popularised by Rev Martin Luther King Jr — ‘We shall overcome’. Ominously, this translation, popularised by the Left in India, was hijacked and elevated to the level of an anthem by Sanjay Gandhi during the Emergency which saw the abrogation of democracy, democratic rights and civil liberties.
In the US, our PM highlighted India’s commitment to fighting terrorism, saying India makes no distinction between “bad terrorism” and “good terrorism”. Soon after came his one-to-one meeting with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli attacks on the Palestinians are ‘justified’ by such definitions, continuing to deny the Palestinians their basic fundamental right to a homeland. Once again an ominous signal.
Those expecting the India-US Joint statement to be a significant advance from the past were forewarned by the spokesman of India’s ministry of external affairs: This India-US Summit interaction had only a limited agenda: “three major components — connecting with each other, vision for the ties and cooperation in various areas”. What emerged instead is the deepening of the India-US strategic partnership, drawing India closer as a strategic, subordinate US ally, globally.
In his first Independence Day speech from Red Fort, the PM spoke of making India an industrial hub by declaring ‘Made in India’ as our ‘motto’. In the US, he said “Make in India” repeatedly. The former is propagated to declare the strengthening of India’s domestic industrial base while the latter is an open invitation for foreign investment, particularly US investment. Their main objective always remains profit maximisation and not augmenting India’s productive capacities. India, thus, appears ready to further liberalise its economy through a greater opening up of our markets, resources and cheap labour for profit maximisation. This is the surest recipe for imposing further hardship on the Indian people.
The RSS chief’s nationally televised speech warns of “a serious upsurge in jihadi activities”, especially in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and “illegal migration of a particular community” in West Bengal, Assam, etc. Such efforts to sharpen communal polarisation come while urging people to restore “the pride of their national Hindu identity”. He said that for millennia, “The unbroken current of national thinking that has prevailed in the vast region between Himalayas and its extensions on one side and the sea on the other, has been known as Hindutva”. He, thus, completely negates the syncretic civilisational advances of our great country.
Thus, the agenda is clear: Transform the secular, democratic Indian Republic into the RSS vision of a rabidly intolerant fascistic ‘Hindu rashtra’ while simultaneously reducing ourselves to being a subordinate ally of US imperialism.

Islamic State fighters backed by tanks and artillery pushed into an embattled Syrian town on the border with Turkey on Monday, touching off heavy street battles with the town’s Kurdish defenders.

Hours after the militants raised two of their Islamic State group’s black flags on the outskirts of Kobani, the militants punctured the Kurdish front lines and advanced into the town itself, the Local Coordination Committees activist collective and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

“They’re fighting inside the city. Hundreds of civilians have left,” said Observatory director Rami Abdurrahman. “The Islamic State controls three neighborhoods on the eastern side of Kobani. They are trying to enter the town from the southwest as well.”

The center of the town was still in Kurdish hands, Abdurrahman said. Kurdish officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
Since it began its offensive in mid-September, the Islamic State group has barrelled through one Kurdish village after another as it closed in on its main target — the town of Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab. The assault has forced some 160,000 Syrians to flee and put a strain on Kurdish forces, who have struggled to hold off the extremists even with the aid of limited U.S.-led airstrikes.

Indian economy to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2015-16: World Bank87

Washington: Indian economy, which accounts for 80 per cent of South Asia's output, is set to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2015-16 as against 5.6 per cent in 2014-15, the World Bank has said.
With economic activity buoyed by expectations from the new elected government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, "India is benefiting from a "Modi dividend"," the Bank said in its twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus report on Monday.
Over the next year or so economic growth should be supported by the recovering US economy that would provide a market for Indian merchandise and service exports, it said.
"India is benefiting from a "Modi dividend"," the Bank said in its twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus report.
#india #economy #economic growth #india economy
"The outlook over the next years for South Asia indicates broad economic stability and a pick-up in growth with potential risks concentrated on the fiscal and structural reform side," said Martin Rama, Chief Economist for South Asia at the World Bank.
"Future growth will increasingly depend on strong investment and export performance," he added.
Private investment is expected to pick up thanks to the government's business orientation, and declining oil prices should boost private sector competitiveness.
But economic reforms will be needed for India to achieve its full long-term growth potential, the report argued.
The report said the region's economy will expand by a real 6 per cent in 2015 and by 6.4 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.4 per cent this year, potentially making it the second fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific. Other countries in the region are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The Bank said India's long-term growth potential remains high due to favourable demographics, relatively high savings, and policies and efforts to improve skills and education, facilitate domestic market integration and incentivise manufacturing activities.
In the medium term, with the economy still below potential and reforms on a gradualist path, growth is expected to accelerate from 5.6 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent and 7 per cent in 2016 and 2017.
Inflation is expected to decline with monetary policy switching to inflation targeting while the current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat as import demand and capital inflows rise.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue with stronger revenue mobilisation, while the oil subsidy burden could decline to 0.6 per cent of GDP if benign global crude prices persist, it said.
Supply chain delays and uncertainty are a major yet under-appreciated constraint to manufacturing growth and competitiveness in India, it said.

Ballarpur Ind surges as IFC plans to buy stake in paper unitBallarpur Ind surges as IFC plans to buy stake in paper unit
SI Reporter | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 09:51 AM IST
Ballarpur Industries has surged 10% to Rs 17.85 on National Stock Exchange after the company said its step down subsidiary Bilt Paper BV has entered into a definitive agreement with International Finance Corp. (IFC) for the sale of new shares worth $100 million.
Following the completion of shares subscription, IFC -- the private sector lending arm of The World Bank -- will own 14.29% stake in Bilt Paper, formerly known as Ballarpur International Graphic Paper Holdings (BIGPH). The deal values Bilt Paper at $600 million.
The subscription of shares is however subject to fulfilment of conditions set out in the definitive documents, the company said.
On 27 June, Ballarpur had told stock exchanges that Bilt Paper was evaluating and exploring options for receiving equity and/or debt investment from IFC. Subsequently, on 3 September, the firm announced that IFC board had approved equity investment of up to $100 million and long-term loans of as much as $150 million. Bilt Paper is also looking at listing its shares at an overseas stock exchange, the company said in the filing.
The stock opened at Rs 18.50 and hit a high of Rs 18.50 on NSE. A combined 1.9 million shares changed hands on the counter in first half-an-hour of trading on NSE and BSE.
 

Pakistan fires across Jammu border again  40 BSF posts targetedPakistan fires at 40 BSF posts in Jammu, protests at UN
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu, October 07, 2014
First Published: 07:57 IST(7/10/2014) | Last Updated: 19:13 IST(7/10/2014)

Pakistani mortars continued to pound villages along the Jammu border for a second straight day on Tuesday as they targeted 40 Border Security Force (BSF) posts in the region, wounding six civilians and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes.
 
BSF officials said Indian forces retaliated with gunfire and mortar bombs after Pakistan Rangers widened the range of their attacks to Poonch, Kanachak, Pargwal, Arnia, Akhnoor and RS Pura sectors, a day after mortar bombs killed five civilians and wounded 29 in the highest civilian death toll in a single day in more than a decade.

“Pakistan targeted 40 of our posts in RS Pura and Akhnoor sector without provocation,” said the BSF inspector general in Jammu, Rajesh Sharma. “We were then forced to fire back in equally strong measure.”
 
Media reports said the Indian and Pakistani DGMOs held talks on ceasefire violations and accused each other of violating the ceasefire.
 
India and Pakistan have been trading fire for about a week, straining India-Pakistan relations which hit a low after New Delhi called off foreign secretary-level talks in August following the Pakistani high commissioner’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders.
This year has been particularly volatile along the border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, which is due for assembly polls as Pakistan typically ratchets up border tensions every time the state holds elections.
 
Pakistan registered its protest with the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) over the firing by the Indian military along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
The BSF director general told HT on Tuesday Indian and Pakistani troops will likely continue shelling each other for a few more days, vowing to give a fitting reply in  the unexpected flare-up that has so far claimed 18 lives on both sides of the border.
 
Sartaj Aziz, Advisor to the Pakistan Prime Minister on National Security and Foreign Affairs, expressed concern over the situation along the Line of Control.
 
"The Indian government has not been able to restrain its forces despite strong diplomatic protest by Pakistan," he said.     "We call upon the Indian government to immediately cease fire and shelling and help us preserve tranquility," he said in a statement.
Aziz said the Pakistani government has been exercising "utmost restraint and responsibility”.
 
“We also extended a hand of friendship to India. However, with abrupt cancellation of foreign secretary-level talks, the Indian side has shunned all our peace overtures. We hope that the Indian side would give peace a chance," he said.
 
BSF sources said Pakistan was deliberately targeting Arnia town, which is about three kilometres from the border, to inflict maximum civilian causalities.
 
“Pakistan is firing about 1.5 km from behind the fence for effective firing. It’s also being done to move away from our radar of observation along the fence. The firing during the night is also the reason for it,” said a BSF official.
 
Home minister Rajnath Singh has urged Pakistan to stop violating the ceasefire attacks if it wants peace talks with India.
 
“We will not tolerate such acts of border violations. We are for peaceful relationship but not at the cost of security to our civilians,” Singh told HT on Monday.

Shiv Sena, MNS attack Modi, say PM has left his work in Delhi to hold sabhas in Maharashtra

Mumbai: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi is campaigning rigorously in poll-bound Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena and Mahasrashtra Navnirman Sena have come together to attack him.
For a second day in a row, Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamna' has taken on Modi saying that the Prime Minister has left his work in Delhi is and conducting sabhas in Maharashtra. The editorial said that Modi has not done anything for Maharashtra after assuming the highest post.
"Prime Minister has left his work in Delhi and is conducting sabhas in Maharashtra. And each day he is making new promises. But after becoming the Prime Minister what has Modi done for Maharashtra," said Saamna.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #maharashtra #shiv sena #mns
The editorial added that even MNS chief Raj Thackeray has pointed out that Modi is behaving like the chief minister of Gujarat. He accused Modi of only focussing on Gujarat and not concentrating on the rest of the country.
With Modi being the star campaigner for the Bharatiya Janata Party and addressing multiple rallies in a day, the editorial hit out at the party saying, "Modi is the only face that BJP has and that's why they want him to campaign in the entire state."
Referring to the change of stance of the BJP after coming to power, Sena said, "During the Congress rule when Manmohan Singh used to campaign, comments were made. The opposition would not miss a single opportunity to take a dig at Manmohan Singh. They used to say Manmmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi were using the state machinery and people's money to campaign."
Taking a dig at Modi for travelling in the state and asking for votes, Sena said, "In the eyes of BJP workers, Modi is not star campaigner but a superstar campaigner. If Modi is such a big star then he should have made an appeal tothe voters of Maharashtra sitting in Delhi."

Jammu & Kashmir floods: Srinagar s GB Pant Hospital shows the way3
0
Srinagar: A month after the deluge, water in most parts of Kashmir has receded and from it have emerged stories of brave hearts who risked their lives to save others. Amongst them are the doctors and staff of GB Pant Children's Hospital in Srinagar who battled the fury of the floods and fast vanishing resources to save the lives of more than 300 children.
As anger brew over doctors in some hospitals for deserting their patients, not many heard about the courage Dr Iram Ali and her team of 50 displayed that day at the GB Pant Hospital in Srinagar.
"Within 10 minutes electricity went, water was 10 feet high, all the ventilators stopped. We detached patients from ventilator and then started pumping manually. It was 3 am, dark. We had to use mobile torch to administor patients. It was a very difficult time. No help came before Sunday morning," recalls Dr Ali.
A month after being submerged in 20 feet of water, OPD has begun operations at the hospital.
#jammu and kashmir floods #floods #jammu #kashmir
"The most difficult time was when we were taking care of the newborns who were premature. Slowly, slowly, almost every other newborne perished in the deluge," remembers Ulfat Ammen, nurse at GB Pant.
As many as 11 children died in those 30 hours. 70 per cent diagnostic machines were damaged and food and water supply was running out.
"We had two canteens on the ground floor. Whatever food material we had, all was submerged in flood waters because we did not have enough time to take it all out. We were drinking saline water. We had half a kg rice which we mixed with Tang and consumed and gave to those in the ICU," says Dr Sartaj Bhatt, Senior resident, GB Pant hospital.
Help finally came in the form of a lone NDRF boat. Critically ill children were evacuated first. It took three days to evacuate the entire hospital. But the doctors and nurses didn't go home. "We left here on Monday and headed to medical camps with the help of Army men and there were attended more patients," says Shabnam Hussain, nurse.
A month after being submerged in 20 feet of water, OPD has begun operations at the hospital.
In a city where health services remain crippled with four of the six major hospitals in shambles, this may be a drop in the ocean. But as these brave doctors have shown us, when a deluge hit, you sometimes have to just do your job to make a difference.

Union Urban Development Minister, M Venkaiah Naidu addressing the eleventh Metropolis conference in Hyderabad on Tuesday.
Hyderabad, Oct. 7:  
The Metropolis has kept media away as it kicked off the eleventh edition of the global conference here on Tuesday.
About 100 reporters from the print and electronic media, who went to cover the event at the HICC in Madhapur, have been asked to sit in a building which is about 1.5 km from the venue and watch the proceedings through video streaming.
The meet is being attended by mayors, urban administrators from different countries.
A government source said it was the Telangana government decision to keep the media away from the proceedings as it expects protests by some journalists on gagging of two Telugu channels.
TV9 and ABN Andhra Jyothi have been blocked out in Telangana for their alleged anti-Telangana stance.
Reporters from these channels have been attending meetings with their mouths tied with black ribbons as a mark of protest.
The K Chandrasekhara Rao government is worried that, if allowed, they would continue the protests, embarrassing the government.

Cos foresee 2007-like boom for talent at all levels | Jobs that pay a neat packetAjit Isaac
(The real recruitment spree…)
MUMBAI: Boom times back in the job market? Recruiters think so. Hiring data for the July-September quarter shows a two-year high and more than half a dozen recruiters reckon levels last seen during the 2007 boom will return in the next few months. The real recruitment spree will come when employers focus on talent for new jobs. Right now, the hiring is brisk thanks mostly to vacant positions being filled.
Top-Level hiring to be up after lag
For Bangalore-based Ikya Human Capital Solutions , the July-September period topped recruitment closures of the last seven years. "We closed around 4,000 positions in all, including 3,000 in temporary staffing. This is more than any quarter till seven years ago," said Ajit Isaac , chairman and MD of the recruitment firm that looks after middle order and temporary hiring. "There is a demand for managing directors in automotive, manufacturing and infrastructure projects," said R Suresh, managing director of RGF Executive Search.
The Japan-headquartered company also touched a 13-month high in its India numbers and closures were significantly higher than same period last year." Another recruitment company that looks mainly at IT middle management hiring said the two-year high includes counter-offers. "This is also good news because it shows mobility in markets and that candidates are willing to look at changes," said the company head, who refused to be named. Also clocking in its best quarter in a couple of years was Bangalore-based The Head Hunters.
Mandates for this recruitment company come from ecommerce, engineering and consumer sectors, according to Kris Lakshmikanth , chief executive of The Head Hunters (India). This September, the recruitment firm hired four senior members for a Canadian company that has operations in Chennai; the posts had been vacant for a while. Staffing companies like Randstad India as well have touched their two-year best this September. "Action from the new government is yet to be seen on ground but we expect larger orders to come in," said Aditya Narayan Mishra, president (staffing) at Randstad India. TeamLease clocked in its highest number of closures in 18 months.
"The number of openings per client has gone up. Earlier, if they wanted one person for the post of a bank manager, they are asking for five now," said co-founder and senior vice-president Rituparna Chakraborty . Brisk hiring will, however, not be in conjunction with any drastic changes in salary structures. Increment levels will be around 15-40% when changing jobs and compensation packages will see more long-term incentives. Hiring for top level talent is also expected to pick up - but after a lag.

Cancel projects given to Chinese companies, demand local power firms

Chinese companies
(The IEEMA last month wrote…)
NEW DELHI: Domestic electrical and electronics equipment makers have asked the government to cancel projects awarded to Chinese state-run firms, arguing that India's critical power distribution system could prove vulnerable and the country may face blackouts if these firms decide to manipulate and damage the national grid.
According to the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers' Association (IEEMA), Chinese firms have been awarded a number of projects to install supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for better power distribution management in 18 cities of Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Puducherry.
The IEEMA last month wrote to the power ministry that China had reportedly mounted almost daily attacks on both government and private computer networks in India, showing its intent and capability over the past one and a half years.
"Under such critical scenario, awarding automation projects related to power distribution network to Chinese company which is under the direct administration of Chinese central government will be a serious threat to national security as electric distribution system carry power to pipelines, water systems, telecommunications and other critical infrastructure, while also serving critical government or military facilities," said the letter, written by IEEMA director general Sunil Misra.
The association added in the letter, "We strongly feel that the government of India should be more focused towards proper security planning and addressing key risks associated towards national critical infrastructure."
The association said that the data of the system was vulnerable to threat and its connectivity to transmission system could pose a threat to the national power transmission grid. "Distribution management system has connectivity to utilities, customer care and billing system which leads to vulnerability to customer database," the letter said.
Till March, the power ministry had sanctioned projects worth about Rs 40,000 crore under its restructured accelerated power development and reforms programme to reduce the transmission and distribution losses.
The association, which was founded in 1948 and has 800 gear makers for power sector as its members, has been opposing imports of Chinese equipment that have been making increasing inroads into the Indian market with their cost competitiveness.
Cyber security experts also believe Chinese equipment poses a threat to Indian power transmission and distribution system.
India has just commissioned a centralised power grid system and there has been learning from Iran where SCADA system was infested with Stuxnet worm, said Mumbai-based cyber law and security expert Prashant Mali, who is a board member of the government's National Security Database project and chairs Cyber Law Foundation.
"The challenge is that equipment supplied and maintained by China can have hidden Trojans that are not detected by Indian agencies and can take control of Indian power grid partially or for some amount of time," said Mali, who also questioned China's intentions behind supplying cheaper electrical equipment and manpower.
Ethical hacker Ankit Fadia said that India's power distribution system is not connected with the internet and is not vulnerable. He added, though, that the system can be manipulated from a remote place if the equipment itself is compromised.

Bhel puts in place cover for whistle-blowersBHEL puts in place official policy for whistle-blowers
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 7, 2014  | 11:49 IST
Photo for representation purposes only
Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) has put in place an official policy for whistle-blowers as part of the effort to meet the higher corporate governance standards introduced under the new Companies Act.
A BHEL official said the new policy aims to ensure that the identity of the whistle-blower will not be revealed and the person exposing corruption or other misdeeds of higher-ups is not subjected to any victimisation.
Under the policy, any other employee assisting in the investigation or furnishing evidence in respect of a complaint will also be protected. However, the policy makes it clear that no protection would be provided from disciplinary action in case the whistle-blower makes a false, motivated or vexatious complaint.
As part of safeguard measures, it has been suggested that the text of the complaint should be carefully drafted so as not to give any details or clue as to the whistle blower's identity.
However, the details of the complaint should be specific and verifiable. Complaints should be addressed to the competent authority or audit committee chairman of the company as the case may be. Then the matter would be referred to the screening committee, which will take a call within one week on whether to proceed further.
In instances where the complaint is against a board level executive, the same would be referred to the Department of Heavy Industry's chief vigilance officer as BHEL comes under Heavy Industry and Public Enterprises Ministry.
This is in accordance with the guidelines of the CVC and the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT).
To ensure better corporate governance standards and transparency, the new Companies Act requires corporates to have in place a vigilance mechanism for directors and employees to report genuine concerns. The listing agreement between companies and stock exchanges also has a similar provision.

Red Herring: Future of information and entertainment lies in radioOctober 6, 2014, 12:01 am IST Indrajit Hazra in Red Herring | India | ET
0
Once or twice a month, always on a Sunday, I pretend to be a media baron. (Funny how, old-fashioned as it may sound, the term still survives when applied to two businesses: media and liquor.) Yesterday, in my media baron avatar, I came to the conclusion that the future of information and entertainment lies in radio.
On Friday, the Great Communicator went on AIR. We have all seen him hold forth in public platforms and even his staunchest critics can’t deny that he has a gift of the gab. But watching good speakers (e.g., the late Ramakrishna Mission monk Swami Lokeswarananda), or even great speakers (e.g., the early comedian Ricky Gervais), do their thing has a different effect on you from when you only hear them, with your eyes ‘on mute’.
Which is where radio comes in. This isn’t the first time an Indian prime minister, in recent times, has cut through the chase of journalists and spoken directly to his audience. In his address to the nation on Doordarshan in December 2012, asking people to maintain peace after the violent protests against the rape of a student in the Capital, then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh magnified his curse of the gab. His query to Doordarshan technicians, “Theek hai?”, at the end of his address was predictably aired and underlined the fact that a post-prime ministerial job in the performative arts, politics included, did not await him. In his farewell address on TV in May this year, he was better. But let’s just say he wasn’t Nach Baliyematerial.
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s ‘Musings from Kumarakom’ in Goa in December 2002, was closer to the Great Communicator’s musings last week. Vajpayee spoke in a statesmanlike fashion about, among other things, Hindutva and secularism, Kashmir and Ayodhya. The problem was he had chosen the wrong medium: the written text that would interest only editorial writers. In any case, it was a one-off. The Great Communicator preferred to heed Marshall Mc-Luhan’s tip about the medium being the message. He wasn’t his usual Kalki avatar. On radio, he was Dadaji in the living room.
Avoiding the vomit-clutter of television, the Great Communicator took a leaf out of, and upgraded, American President Franklin D Roosevelt’s successful ‘fireside chats’, a series of 30 evening radio addresses between 1933 and 1944 (radio being the television of those times). He chatted about the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, speciallyabled children and made an unobtrusive pitch for khadi. He also peppered things up by including two aphoristic tales: one, told by his hero Swami Vivekananda, about a tiger who lived with goats and needed to rediscover his ‘tigerness’; the other about a man sitting on a pavement asking for directions.
The Great Communicator’s first radio show got me remembering the thrills of listening to radio shows in the 1980s: supernatural, detective and fairy-tale radio plays and dramatic readings. These weren’t Press Information Bureau drones. These were full-on sophisticated entertainment programmes that remain much more ‘believable’ than any series or show (news included) on Indian television today.
We still think of radio as something archaic, a medium that appeals only in villages where people huddle around a radio set while having a smoke. But radio has had a hardware revolution — in the car on FM and on mobile phones everywhere else. What it needs now is a software Golden Age.
The Great Communicator has said he’ll have his ‘Man ki baat’ show once or twice a month, on Sundays at 11:00 am. (It would be worth tracking the numbers of those tuning in to listen to him and those tuning in to watch Aamir Khan on TV for his Satyamev Jayatewhen the timings clash.) Actors can also ‘perform’ audio books and radio plays.
Nothing matches the drama and sound effects — of a door creaking open before a murder, of seagulls crying as Sinbad takes to the sea again, of the sound of a tight slap in a comedy sketch — of radio. Imagine if someone with the Great Communicator’s USP comes on radio for a weekly science show in Hindi.
Before the Great Communicator, there was Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Grand Inquisitor from his novel The Brothers Karamozov. “There are three powers, three powers alone, able to overcome and capture once and for all the conscience of these impotent undisciplined creatures so as to give them happiness. These forces are miracle, mystery and authority,” he tells us. All three are there for the giving and the taking in this medium. So put the radio on.

JSW Steel in Talks to Buy London Mining: ReportKotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
New Delhi/Bangalore:
India's third-largest steelmaker, JSW Steel Ltd, is in talks to buy embattled West African iron ore miner London Mining, showing Indian firms' growing appetite to secure raw materials abroad, sources familiar with the matter said.
London Mining was one of several junior miners set up in West Africa during the boom years on the back of rising demand for iron ore, hoping to turn the region into a new producing frontier to compete with Australia and Brazil. Instead, they have battled infrastructure woes, high costs and low prices.
The debt-burdened miner, whose shares have dropped 96 per cent so far this year, warned last week it did not have enough cash to operate its only mine and was in talks about a potential strategic investment - though that would involve significant equity dilution.
It declined to comment on Monday. A JSW spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
"Talks (with London Mining) have been going on for many months. JSW people have visited them also," said one of the sources, who declined to be named as the talks are not public.
The source said London Mining would come "cheap" for JSW, thanks to its shrunken market valuation of roughly $10 million - though debt swells its enterprise value to over $290 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The source added a deal would be aimed at helping JSW meet its own demand for iron ore.
Action against illegal mining in India has led to a sharp fall in domestic iron ore output, forcing JSW to import heavily. It plans to ship in 10 million tonnes of iron ore in this fiscal year ending March 31.
News of the talks, confirming a weekend report in Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, sent shares in AIM-listed London Mining up almost 18 per cent in early trading on Monday. At 0850 GMT, the stock was up 8.9 per cent at 4.92 pence.
African Minerals, a rival producer in the region, saw its shares rise 8.2 per cent.
BUYING ABROAD
JSW, controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal, has been eyeing up supply of raw materials and even steelmaking capacity outside India, securing mining assets in Chile, Mozambique and the United States. It is also close to buying some steel mills owned by Italy's Lucchini and considering buying the privately owned Ilva steel plant, also in Italy.
In a similar push abroad, Jindal Steel and Power, controlled by Sajjan's brother Naveen Jindal, has already bought coal mines in South Africa, Mozambique and Australia. It has also been looking for iron ore mines in Africa, its executives have said.
Analysts and sources familiar with the matter cautioned, however, that even if it was successful in its bid, Jindal would need to tackle many of the issues that have troubled London Mining and its peers, not least costs.
"Their operating cost is still too high against the current iron ore price. It's not a bad asset, but having so much debt when the iron ore price is so low, and when you're not generating free cash flow, just doesn't work," said analyst Carole Ferguson at SP Angel in London.
West African miners are higher-cost producers at roughly $75-85 per tonne delivered to China, compared with big three Brazil's Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, with costs of about $45-55.
BHP said on Monday that it aims to cut its iron ore production costs by more than 25 per cent and squeeze more tonnes from its mines.

Lights  camera  suspect actionMore
Lights, cameras on suspect actions
From multiple bowlers being reported to the dominance of IPL teams, ESPNcricinfo picks five major themes from the Champions League T20
By Siddarth Ravindran and Karthik Krishnaswamy | ESPNcricinfo –  Sun 5 Oct, 2014 7:30 AM IST
The finalists -- Kolkata and Chennai.
Suspect actions
This season will likely be remembered as the one with the epidemic of spinners reported for suspect actions. It began with Lahore Lions' Adnan Rasool, touted as one of the contenders for Saeed Ajmal 's spot in the Pakistan team, before claiming four others, including Mohammad Hafeez and Sunil Narine , two players who are pivotal to their team.
At the international level, match officials are only a preliminary step in determining the legality of a bowler's action before the bio-mechanists take over with their array of tests. In a three-week tournament like the CLT20, there is no time for the elaborate processes put in place by the ICC. The CLT20's bowling-action policy lacked clarity, and came in for criticism, including from former West Indies captain and former match referee Clive Lloyd. Still, the policy resulted in Knight Riders being deprived of Narine, the most successful bowler over six seasons of the CLT20, for the final.
South African teams fizzle out
Cape Cobras might have been one of the favourites to win the CLT20 if Dale Steyn and JP Duminy had been fit to play for them. As it happened, Cobras were without either of them, not to mention Beuran Hendricks, who was out with a long-term injury, or Jacques Kallis , who chose to play for Kolkata Knight Riders. But even with a weakened team, their level of performance was unexpectedly poor - a particular low-light being their shoddy fielding against Northern Knights - and their only win came via a Super Over against Barbados Tridents.
In the other group, Dolphins didn't even manage that one consolation win. Their most notable contribution to the tournament may have been the late assault by Robbie Frylinck against Lahore Lions, which significantly disadvantaged the team from Pakistan in their net-run-rate tussle with Chennai Super Kings. In all, it was quite possibly the poorest-ever CLT20 for South Africa's domestic competition, which has in the past contributed two finalists.
In the shadow of the Asian Games
The tournament may have had a huge crowd on the opening day in Raipur and large numbers for the knockouts, but as with every year, the CLT20 struggled to keep fans hooked. The declining profile of tournament's ever-changing title sponsors highlights this - from one of India's best known brands Airtel in the opening season, to a brand no one had heard of before the tournament began this year.
The organisers' challenge to draw in sports fans was made tougher than usual this season since the Asian Games coincided almost exactly with the CLT20. With large sections of the sports pages given over to the coverage of the Asian Games, the CLT20 was relegated to the margins, even for matches involving IPL teams. Perhaps one of the biggest cheers during the tournament was in the semi-finals at Hyderabad when the giant-screen flashed the news that India had beaten Pakistan to win gold in hockey.
IPL teams grow even more dominant
New South Wales Blues won the inaugural edition of the CLT20 in 2009, beating Trinidad & Tobago in the final. None of the four semi-finalists was an IPL team. Since then, the IPL has asserted its supremacy over world's other T20 leagues, providing three of the CLT20's four winners and five of its eight finalists between 2010 and 2013.
This year, the gulf between the IPL teams and the rest was at its widest. Three Indian teams reached the semi-finals, and no non-IPL team beat an IPL team, except during the qualifiers. Part of this, of course, may have been because all eight players with loyalties divided between teams from their home country and the IPL chose to represent their IPL franchises. Barbados Tridents won just the one game, but would their results have been as poor with Dwayne Smith and Kieron Pollard in their line-up? Would Hobart Hurricanes have beaten Kings XI Punjab had their captain not led the other side and scored a crucial unbeaten 34 in a nervy chase?
New-ish kids on the block
For an IPL team owner or coach, the flip side of this sort of dominance is the fact that it might have shrunk the space for players from other teams to audition for future IPL contracts. There was no unknown player who announced himself to the world, like Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine did in previous editions of the tournament. If the unofficial embargo on Pakistani players remains in place, the list of players who might have caught the eye of IPL teams in this edition of the Champions League isn't particularly long.
Aiden Blizzard reminded everyone why Mumbai Indians signed him three years ago, Joel Paris and Trent Boult might have added themselves to prospective lists of left-arm seamers to chase, while a whole lot of teams might want a slice of Mitchell Marsh , provided he puts himself up for sale this time around. In terms of one-off impact, Jonathan Carter and Cameron Delport did themselves no harm.
The one player who made a serious case to become a marquee signing was Kane Williamson . Apart from the sheer volume of runs he scored, what stood out was how effortlessly he destroyed bowling of all kinds, particularly spin.

Pakistan stumble in Australia spin trapAustralia had Pakistan crushing defeat
ONE-OFF T20I, DUBAI — Maxwell's spin restricts Pakistan to just 96. Warner fifty seals six-wicket win.

Australia 97 for 4 (Warner 53*, Hasan 2-17) beat Pakistan 96 for 9 (Maxwell 3-13, Boyce 2-10) by six wickets
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
Maxwell: 3-13 in 3 overs. Glenn Maxwell spun out the first three Pakistan wickets on a slow turner as the hosts limped to 96 and lost the only T20 international to Australia by six wickets. Had it not been for 20 extras, the second-highest contributor to the innings after debutant Saad Nasim's 25, Pakistan would have struggled to get anywhere close to 100. Pakistan's spinners, in the absence of the banned Saeed Ajmal , hit back to have Australia 56 for 4, but David Warner sealed the chase in 14 overs with an unbeaten 53 off 39.
Shahid Afridi had expected the pitch to play slow and low but it also had plenty of turn, as his top order was to find out after he chose to bat. Pakistan went too hard too soon, and Maxwell made them pay. Awais Zia forced a mis-hit to mid-off, Umar Amin was stumped after a charge and a heave third ball, and Sohaib Maqsood played all around a turning offbreak.
Pakistan were 23 for 3 and slid further when Shehzad punched the legspinner Cameron Boyce to slip. Boyce, one of two international and four T20 debutants for Australia, settled down to bowl some lovely, flighted legbreaks.
To add to the capitulation to spin, Umar Akmal slogged at Kane Richardson 's fifth ball, and mid-off took the skier. Afridi was Pakistan's final hope, but he missed his third delivery, a full one from Sean Abbott , to fall lbw.
The lower order, with help from Nasim, did well to bat out the 20 overs and stretch the score from 46 for 6 in the tenth over, but it was never really going to be enough, especially if one of Maxwell or Warner got going.
Maxwell did not last too long, although he got off the mark with a reverse-swept four over backward point off Raza Hasan. Afridi trapped him in front with a straighter one for 17 and Hasan took care of Aaron Finch and Steven Smith .
Just when it seemed another Pakistan attack would make a match out of almost nothing, Warner stepped up. With Pakistan playing only two frontline spinners in Hasan and Afridi, Warner went after the quicks, muscling them for boundaries before bringing up the win against the part-time slow bowlers. Pakistan had managed all of four fours and no sixes in their innings. Warner alone struck four fours and three sixes.

Narine doesn t know what s wrong: GambhirTweet
0
Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gautam Gambhir is confident Sunil Narine will return a "better bowler and a stronger individual" after being reported twice for a suspect action during the Champions League T20. Speaking exclusively to ESPNcricinfo Gambhir said, "He [Narine] is, was and will always be an integral part of KKR and the entire squad will stand behind him and I hope he can come back as a stronger human being and can achieve much bigger heights than he has achieved in the past."
Narine was suspended from bowling in the CLT20 final and was also withdrawn from the West Indies squad for the ODI series against India starting later this week. Gambhir admitted he was "shocked" when he was first told about Narine's action being reported after a group game against the Dolphins on September 29.
"The only thing I can say at the moment is it's a tough time for him, but he's a strong character. I had a long chat with him after the game and I told him he needed to get this monkey off his back because he himself doesn't know if there's anything wrong with his action," said Gambhir. "The good thing is now he will get to know whether there is actually a problem in his action. If there is any, he will try to sort that out and come back a stronger human being and a stronger character as well. He could take all that pressure and be a much better bowler as well. Sometimes when these things start playing in your mind, what will happen if I bowl this delivery, what will people be talking, etc. Once he gets this off his back I am 100% sure he will be a much better bowler."
Narine is another in a long line of offspinners including Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal and Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake who have been called in recent months for suspect bowling actions. Ajmal and Senanayake are banned from bowling in international cricket at the moment. Gambhir says that while he finds "nothing wrong" with the purge on bowlers with suspect actions he hopes there is consistency in the process.
"Hopefully they are not targeting certain bowlers and they should not be targeting certain bowlers," he said. "Sometimes the biggest challenge in these things is to be consistent and that's where I think it can get unfair. Till the time you are fair I am fine with it, whether it has to do with actions, batsmen, bowlers or xyz. For me consistency is very important in any sport."
Narine with GambhirIn Narine's absence, Knight Riders were beaten comfortably by eight wickets in the CLT20 final by Chennai Super Kings. While Gambhir admitted he missed the offspinner's services, he said the change in conditions played a big role in the outcome. "[When] Batting first [and with] the way the ball was gripping, we thought 170 was a good total, so getting to 180 we were very confident that we could defend that total," he said. "Sometimes the dew makes it very unfair on the spinners, their spinners got a lot more out of the wicket than ours and we had quality spinners as well. Raina played a very good knock and obviously conditions changed as well. I don't want to take anything away from CSK."
While Narine's career is at a crossroads, another young spinner blooded by Knight Riders in the tournament, Kuldeep Yadav, has been fast-tracked into the Indian ODI team. Gambhir believes the key to the left-arm chinaman bowler's success was "identifying the best time to put him on the park.
"We could have easily played him in the IPL, but we though the ideal opportunity would be to play him against a foreign side in the Champions League. It is a very easy for a young kid to lose his confidence, especially in this format and it's very difficult to build that confidence."
Gambhir also added a note of caution saying that while Kuldeep has "a very bright future," he still has "a long way to go.
"He's young, not a lot of people have seen him. But the challenge is when people start identifying you and figuring you out. I hope he goes from what he has achieved till now and keeps working hard on his game."
Gambhir's own game has been struggling recently. His 52-ball 80 in the final came after a patch of poor scores. But he is of the view that judging a batsman's form on the basis of T20 performances is unfair.
"People say it's a batsman's format, but at the same time the bowler has a lot of opportunities to take your wicket. When you are taking a risk there is always a chance you will lose your wicket because you are only playing 120 balls," he said. "Sometimes team strategy is to go hard in the first six overs and you have to do that even when you are not hitting the ball well. It is always a challenge."
Gambhir's international future has also been the subject of much debate after his return to the Test team for the final two matches in England produced dismal results. After being dismissed for scores of 0, 3, 4 and 18 many believe Gambhir will find it hard to make another comeback.
"Obviously when you don't do well there will always be critics taking a shot at you and that's fine," he said. "You play a game and when you do well you get praise, so you should be able to take the criticism as well. For me it was always a confidence thing. Maybe making a comeback is never easy, if I had been able to get a few starts, obviously I would have been a lot more confident. For me, if I am confident mentally a lot of things can be taken care of.
"The important thing is to keep scoring runs. We have a big domestic season coming up. If the runs come, the technical things people keep talking about can be taken care of. Stay in the present, keep scoring runs and see where it goes."

Hewlett-Packard to split into two for sharper focusHewlett-Packard to split into two for sharper focus
Reuters
Reuters
New York, Oct 6:  
Hewlett and Packard are finally going their separate ways. Not literally, of course, as the founders of the Silicon Valley technology conglomerate that bears their names have long shuffled off this mortal coil. But the company now led by Meg Whitman is set to break in two.
HP, which has a market value of $66 billion, will announce as soon on October 6 plans to separate its business manufacturing laptops, computers and printers from the one that serves large corporate and government customers with hardware and services, the Wall Street Journal reports.
While a big move for a slow-moving company founded in 1939, it's actually a bit behind the curve as far as shareholders are concerned. They have been expecting just such a split for some time. Whitman's predecessor proposed a similar measure back before he was shown the door. And it was one of the options that Ralph Whitworth, the activist shareholder at Relational Investors who became HP's chairman until taking a leave in July, wanted HP to consider.
Reuters Breakingviews argued nearly two years ago that the company's assets would be worth almost double its then-market capitalization in a breakup. Investors appear to have agreed, sending HP shares up from about $13 in December 2012 to $35 today.
Whitman could have continued to argue that there were synergies in duct-taping a consumer hardware business endangered by the age of mobile computing with a potentially more stable operation focused on solving the complicated problems of large enterprises. The printing and personal systems unit saw sales slip some 7 per cent last year.
Using the recent revival in its stock-market fortunes to perform surgery, rather than go with the flow, is a smart move by HP's board. Better to perform the operation voluntarily than be forced into it by disappointing earnings or a crack in the market. It also allows Whitman to hedge her bets. She will be CEO of the corporate IT business and chair the hardware unit. In all other respects, however, Hewlett and Packard are set to finally part company.
Hewlett-Packard, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, plans to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct 5.
The move, which could be announced as early as October 6, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue in the year to October.
Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year. Meg Whitman, HP chief executive, will be chairman of the computer and printer business and CEO of the other business.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
HP's printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to results for the most recent financial quarter. It is not clear how many of HP's more than 300,000 staff work in each of the businesses.

Facebook Closes WhatsApp Purchase Now Worth $21.8 Billion
Associated Press | Updated On: October 07, 2014 07:47 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
New York: Facebook has completed its acquisition of the mobile messaging service WhatsApp for almost $22 billion, up from the original $19 billion when the cash-and-stock deal was struck early this year thanks in part to the rising price of Facebook shares.
Facebook named WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum to its board Monday. WhatsApp is by far the largest acquisition for the Menlo Park, California company, and bigger than any deals made by Google, Microsoft or Apple.
The price that Facebook was willing to pay raised eyebrows when the buyout was announced February 19, though analysts agreed that landing the popular site made sense. Including cash, stock and restricted stock awarded to WhatsApp employees, the deal is worth $21.8 billion based on Facebook's stock price on Monday.
WhatsApp has been growing rapidly, especially in developing countries like Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia, and now has more than 500 million users.
WhatsApp lets users chat with their phone contacts, both one-on-one and in groups. It also allows people to send texts, photos, videos and voice recordings over the Internet and lets them text or call people overseas without heavy charges. Free to use for the first year and costing $1 per year after that, the service has no advertising.
Facebook, which has its own mobile messaging app called Messenger, plans to keep WhatsApp as a separate service.
The acquisition was approved by antitrust authority of the European Union on Friday.
Facebook's shares climbed 32 cents to $77.76 in afternoon trading on Monday

India to top global remittances with $71 billion this year
PTI Oct 7, 2014, 09.03AM IST
("Remittance inflows provided…)
WASHINGTON: India will retain its top spot with USD 71 billion in remittances this year as remittances to developing countries are expected to reach USD 435 billion, an increase of five per cent over 2013, the World Bank has said.
In its latest issue of the Migration and Development Brief, the World Bank said yesterday India, with the world's largest emigrant stock of 14 million people, will remain in the top spot this year, attracting about USD 71 billion in remittances.
"Remittances to developing countries grew this year by five per cent. Remittance inflows provided stable cover for substantial parts of the import bill for such countries as Egypt, Pakistan, Haiti, Honduras, and Nepal," said Kaushik Basu, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank Group.
He said India and China led the chart with "projected remittance inflows of USD 71 and USD 64 billion respectively in 2014."
Other large recipients are China (USD 64 billion), the Philippines (USD 28 billion), Mexico (USD 24 billion), Nigeria (USD 21 billion), Egypt (USD 18 billion), Pakistan (USD 17 billion), Bangladesh (USD 15 billion), Vietnam (USD 11 billion) and Ukraine (USD 9 billion).
The growth rate this year is substantially faster than the 3.4 per cent growth recorded in 2013, driven largely by remittances to Asia and Latin America, it said.
Remittances to developing countries will continue climbing in the medium term, reaching an estimated USD 454 billion in 2015. Global remittances, including those to high-income countries, are estimated at USD 582 billion this year, rising to USD 608 billion next year, it said.
The Bank said remittances to the South Asia region are increasing more robustly this year, accelerating from slower growth in 2013. Although flows to India, the region's largest remittance recipient, will grow modestly by 1.5 per cent in 2014.
The expansion is being led by flows from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, where skilled and unskilled workers are finding renewed job opportunities.
As a result, the growth rate of remittances to the region is expected to more than double this year to 5.5 per cent (from 2.7 per cent in 2013), boosting volumes to USD 117 billion in 2014 and rising further to USD 123 billion in 2015, it said.
"In addition, India and the Philippines benefit from having migrants with the most diverse destination spread, thereby creating buffers against regional shocks. Given the growing importance of this sector, the World Bank's Migration and Development Brief has become an essential tool for global development policy experts," Basu said.
The brief notes that the global average cost of sending remittances continued its downward trend in the third quarter of 2014, falling to 7.9 per cent of the value sent, compared to 8.9 per cent a year earlier. However, the cost of sending money to Africa remains stubbornly high, exceeding 11 per cent.
As a share of GDP (2013), the top recipients of remittances were Tajikistan (42 per cent), Kyrgyz Republic (32 per cent), Nepal (29 per cent), Moldova (25 per cent), Lesotho and Samoa (24 per cent each), Armenia and Haiti (both 21 per cent), the Gambia (20 per cent) and Liberia (18 per cent).
It said the forced migration due to conflict was at its highest level since World War II, affecting more than 51 million people.
An additional 22 million people have been forced to move due to natural disasters, bringing the total affected by forced migration to at least 73 million, according to the latest available data.
"Despite the encouraging outlook for remittance flows, the circumstances of many migrants are troubling," said Dilip Ratha, Lead Economist, Migration and Remittances, at the World Bank's Development Prospects Group and Head of the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD).
"With so many people on the move against their will and many others undertaking desperate and dangerous journeys, it is clear that more effort is needed to make migration safer and cheaper by exploring economically viable policy options," he said.

Metals, healthcare, capital goods and consumer durables major losers
Mumbai, Oct 7:  
The BSE benchmark Sensex today plunged 296 points to close at nearly two-month low due to widespread losses in metal, healthcare, consumer durables and capital goods sector stocks on capital outflows and retail investors ahead of earnings season amid a mixed trend overseas.
After opening 137 points lower, the 30-share index continued its slide to touch the day’s low of 26,250.24 before ending the day at almost two-month low of 26,271.97, a level not seen since August 14, registering a steep fall of 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
The gauge had lost 62.52 points in the previous session on Octrober 1. Stock markets remained closed on October 2, 3 and 6 for Gandhi Jayanti, Dussehra and Id-Ul-Zuha, respectively.
FII/FPIs pulled out Rs 63.24 crore from domestic markets on October 1, according to exchange data.
Similarly, the broad-based NSE Nifty closed down by 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent at 7,852.40 after shuttling between 7,943.05 and 7,842.70.
Brokers said the sentiment dampened on foreign capital outflows and offloading of positions by retail investors ahead of the earnings season, with Infosys posting results later this week.
Of the 30 Sensex shares, 23 closed lower led by Hindalco (down 4.35 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (4.32 per cent) and Cipla (3.67 per cent), while NTPC, Gail and Tata Motors remained major gainers.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 63.24 crore last Wednesday as per the provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
Sectorwise, BSE metal index suffered the most by falling 2.65 per cent, followed by healthcare by 1.85 per cent.
Captial goods index by 1.78 per cent, Consumer durables index by 1.72 per cent, Realy index 1.27 per cent, PSU index 1.20 per cent and Banking index 0.87 per cent were the other significant losers.
Global markets
Globally, a mixed closing on the other Asian markets and a lower opening of the European stocks as a report showed German industrial production contracted the most in more than five years, also negatively impacted sentiment.
European shares fell in early trade on Tuesday after German industrial output fell far more than expected, but losses were limited by gains in mining shares after Rio Tinto rejected a merger approach from rival Glencore.
At 0755 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 per cent at 1,341.44 points. The benchmark index had gained 1.1 per cent over the past two sessions.
"Volatility has surged again in Europe, but there's no clear trend in terms of direction," Aurel BGC analyst Gerard Sagnier said. "It's better to move to the sidelines for now. Investors need to be patient, the bullish trend will resume at some point."
Asian shares rose on Tuesday, while the dollar languished after investors locked in some gains on its recent rally.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up about 0.3 per cent in late afternoon trade, after wobbling between positive and negative territory as it took its cues from a choppy, losing session on Wall Street overnight.
Japan's Nikkei stock average ended down 0.7 percent, after the Bank of Japan offered a bleaker view on factory output. The BOJ maintained its massive asset buying programme, as widely expected.
Hong Kong shares finished higher for a third day in a row on Tuesday, with investor confidence recovering as pro-democracy demonstrations eased in the wake of a meeting between protest leaders and government officials.
The Hang Seng Index rose 0.5 percent to 23,422.52 points. The China Enterprises Index of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was 0.6 percent higher.

MOM sends first 3D image of red planetMOM sends first 3D image of Red planet
By Srinivas Laxman, TNN | 7 Oct, 2014, 10.23AM IST
The 3D picture was generated from multiple images taken by MOM's Mars Colour Camera on September 28 from an altitude of nearly 74,500 km. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI: Just 96 hours into the Martian orbit, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) has released its first 3D image of the red planet. MOM had entered the Martian orbit on September 24.
The 3D picture was generated from multiple images taken by MOM's Mars Colour Camera on September 28 from an altitude of nearly 74,500 km. It has expanded on the 2D image of Mars that was released earlier. Isro said in order to obtain the 3D effect, viewers will have to use red and blue anaglyph glasses. "What sorcery is this? Get your 3D glasses to look at Mars the way I do," MOM tweeted.
Seeing the image through the glasses will give one the impression of being close to the red planet. A huge dust storm in the northern hemisphere and below it the southern polar ice cap are also clearly visible.
Immediately after its public release, the 3D image received 1,185 likes on MOM's Facebook page, with some saying a portion of Mars reminded them of the southern part of India. Universe Today, a well-known US-based space and astronomy website, described it as a "breathtakingly glorious view".
The Mars Colour Camera was designed and made by Isro's Ahmedabad-based Space Application Centre.

Sensex under pressure  drops over 100 points; top 12 stocks in focusSensex under pressure, drops over 100 points; top twelve stocks in focus

(Tracking the momentum,…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex extended losses in mid-morning trade on Tuesday, down as much as 137 points, led by losses in HDFC, HDFC Bank, ITC, M&M and Cipla.
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index also came under pressure but was trading above its crucial psychological level of 7900.
At 10:05 a.m.; the 30-share was trading at 26,474.21, down 94 points or 0.35 per cent. It touched a high of 26570.38 and a low of 26430.65 in early trade.
The Nifty was at 7914, down 31 points or 0.40 per cent. It touched a high of 7943.05 and a low of 7897.15 in early trade.
"Broadly, the CNX Nifty index has been trading within 7850-8050 range for last six trading sessions and either side decisive break will trigger the next directional move," said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities Limited.
"Meanwhile, traders should maintain extra caution and prefer defensive sectors like Pharma, FMCG for short term positions," he added,
Manglik is of the view that investors', on the other hand, should now focus more on stock specific approach before the beginning of earning season and adjust their portfolios accordingly.

Services activity growth rose in September: PMIServices activity growth rises in Sept on robust demand, says HSBC survey

Activity in the private sector has expanded steadily since May (Photo: Reuters)
Growth in services activity picked up pace in September as order books filled up at a faster rate, a business survey showed on Tuesday.
The HSBC Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 51.6 in September from 50.6 in August, reversing a slowdown seen in the previous two months.
A reading above 50 signifies growth while anything below the level denotes contraction.
The new business sub-index climbed to 52.4 from 51.9, signalling robust demand.
"Service sector activity bottomed out in September thanks to stronger new business flows," said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at survey sponsor HSBC.
In what might also give some respite to the domestic economy, which has long struggled with high inflation, the sub-index measuring output price growth fell to a near four-year low.
The country's annual consumer price inflation eased in August to 7.80 per cent from 7.96 per cent in July. Wholesale prices also rose at a slower clip during that month.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), however, does not appear to be in a hurry to ease monetary policy and hinted last week that it would not do so until it was confident that consumer inflation could be reduced to a target of 6 per cent by January 2016.
Activity in the private sector has expanded steadily since May, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a landslide mandate that created a wave of optimism over the country's economic prospects.
But the lack of sweeping reforms by the Modi government so far has taken the sheen off those hopes.
"A pick up in reform effort is sorely needed to put growth on a firmer footing and address supply side risks to inflation," Neumann said.
The survey showed firms' confidence regarding future business grew at the slowest pace in a year last month.

Oil PSUs set for structural change
Rahul Prithiani
oil and gas - upstream activities
Under-recoveries (losses incurred on selling regulated fuels like diesel, LPG and kerosene below their cost prices) on petroleum products are expected to decline by over 50 per cent over the next 2 years from 2013-14 levels due to decline in crude oil prices as well as ongoing efforts to move towards market-linked diesel prices. This will have a significant positive impact on the profitability of oil PSUs and the exchequer as well.
CRISIL Research believes that international crude oil prices and thereby petroleum product prices will slip by 8-10 per cent over the next two years to about $100 per barrel in 2015 from an average of $109 per barrel in 2013, barring any major geo-political events, fuelled by supply glut, waning demand growth and increased use of cleaner fuels.
While crude oil output from Iraq, Iran and North America will increase, global demand is expected to be impacted by weak consumption. The tepid consumption growth will be on account of better efficiencies and a shift towards natural gas in developed regions like North America and Europe, as well as relatively slower increase in demand from developing countries such as China and Indonesia because of reduction in subsidies and slower economic growth.
The benefits of declining crude oil prices on Indian oil PSUs are already visible. Together with continuous monthly increase in retail diesel prices (since January 2013), the under-recovery on the sale of diesel has been eliminated in September 2014.
This is expected to provide huge relief as losses on diesel accounted for about 45 per cent of the total under-recovery burden in 2013-14. Consequently, we expect under-recoveries to halve to Rs.600-700 billion by 2015-16 from Rs.1,400 billion in 2014-15.
The under-recovery burden is shared by the government and oil PSUs — both upstream (oil and gas producing companies) and downstream (oil marketing companies) — .
Declining under-recoveries will help increase the profits of the downstream and upstream companies as well as improve the government’s finances by lowering oil subsidies and containing the oil import bill.
The profit after tax of downstream PSUs is likely to increase by Rs.35-40 billion year-on-year in 2014-15 and by other Rs.7-10 billion in 2015-16 because their interest costs will decrease with the decline in their working capital requirements, and they would not have to any under-recovery burden.
Upstream companies, which typically share 40-50 per cent of the total under-recovery burden on petroleum products, will see a sharper improvement of Rs.105-120 billion year-on-year in net profit in 2014-15 and a further improvement of Rs.70-75 billion in 2015-16. This is because the impact of the reduced burden of under-recoveries on upstream companies will more than offset the impact of decline in realisations due to lower crude oil prices.
The net realisations of upstream companies are expected to increase by $20-25 per barrel over the next two years. Moreover, if we include the benefits arising from potential hike in domestic gas prices there could be a further upside in the profitability of upstream oil PSUs.
The good news does not just end with better oil companies’ profitability. Even India’s oil subsidies and net oil import bill will decline over the next two years as compared to a significant increase in the past two years.
This will be a huge relief for the economy as oil imports comprised the single largest item, accounting for nearly one-third of India’s import bill of $450 billion in fiscal 2014.
Between fiscals 2012 and 2014, the oil import bill rose 12 per cent a year (CAGR) because of rising prices and a weak rupee.

Small City Routes Hold Big Potential for Indian Carriers
Reuters | Updated On: October 06, 2014 08:17 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
The airport in Patna, one of India's smaller cities and the capital of its poorest state, is so crowded that government authorities this year said they need to build another one.
The airport has seen the number of passengers, and daily flights, double in the last four years as the country's largest carrier IndiGo Airlines and smaller rivals like GoAir seek to cash in on a surge in demand for air travel from smaller regions to offset losses on highly competitive "trunk" routes linking big cities.
"We are close to capacity in our arrivals and departure lounges," said Santosh Kumar, who runs operations at Patna airport. "We can handle more planes but it is only possible with a bigger terminal. We need a bigger airport."
Higher disposable incomes, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanisation have made India one of the world's fastest growing domestic aviation markets, where passenger numbers are expected to grow by more than 75 percent in the next six years to exceed 217 million.
Much of that growth is expected to come from smaller cities like Patna, where more people are flying for the first time. Passenger numbers from these places have risen nearly 17 percent a year since 2009, compared to 7.6 percent from larger hubs, data from industry analysts CAPA - Centre for Aviation show.
That trend is set to continue as more airports are built in smaller cities. This month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government picked five smaller cities to kick off a nationwide initiative to build about 50 new airports.
"The opportunity is changing," said Aditya Ghosh, president of IndiGo, which now flies larger Airbus A320 planes to and from Patna instead of smaller ATR jets. "On some of these smaller routes, the planes are more full than the trunk routes."
Fifth largest carrier GoAir has also boosted flights to and from Patna and other smaller cities, Chief Executive Giorgio de Roni said, as these regional routes now make more money than the more congested routes between Mumbai and Delhi.
Flag carrier Air India's regional unit is also looking at increasing its fleet to tap a larger share of this market, industry officials said. Air India did not respond to requests for comment.
While more established carriers see regional travel as a way to counter the razor-thin margins and losses on big city routes, a crop of new airlines are catering only to regional demand.
Zav Airways plans to start flying within the northeast in 2015, when Air Carnival also aims to fly within the south, according to CAPA.
Air Costa began flying within southern India last October and this year, it agreed to buy 50 jets from Embraer SA in the biggest aircraft deal for an Indian regional carrier so far this year.
Chief Financial Officer Vivek Choudhary said Air Costa was bracing for competition. "But we are capitalising on the first-mover advantage," he added.
For now, demand for regional travel outstrips supply, making the sector attractive for airlines. Air travel penetration in India remains small in global terms, with 0.04 annual trips per capita against 0.3 in China and more than two in the United States.
Industry analysts, however, warn that as more carriers pile into the sector, fares will fall and airlines will face the same pressure on yields as they do now on big city routes.
"There is huge latent demand in some of these smaller cities," said Dhiraj Mathur, an executive director at PwC India who focuses on aerospace and defence. "But there's always a danger from increased competition."

Modi staking his prestige by becoming star campaignerHis plan: to come to power in as many state capitals as possible, and get a majority in the Rajya Sabha to pass critical bills
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Given the setback it faced in the three sets of bypolls since the Lok Sabha elections, it was surprising that the BJP should decide to use the Prime Minister as its chief campaigner in the October 15 Maharashtra and Haryana elections.
The PM does not normally crisscross through a state as if everything depended on him, and this highlights an insecurity in the BJP. But Narendra Modi, tipped to address as many as 15-20 meetings in Maharashtra alone, is staking his personal prestige on the outcome. There is undoubtedly an element of risk in making Modi the chief campaigner.
For starters, he needs to contain the fallout of the split with Sena. The allies had after all held together for a quarter of a century, through thick and thin. Though he is ripping into the NCP and its leader Sharad Pawar, what may come to Modi's aid is the NCP's break with the Congress, that too one hour after the BJP and Sena decided to part company.
In a four or a five-way contest, any party which gets around 25- 26% of the votes can romp home or emerge as the single largest party able to lead the government. In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had polled 27.6 % of the popular vote (and 23 Lok Sabha seats, as opposed to 18 won by ally Shiv Sena, which had polled just over 20% of the vote).
The BJP stands a chance of emerging as the single largest party, even if its voteshare comes down a little, provided the Sena does not increase its popular share by a 5-6% to get past the BJP. Modi's other challenge is to sell the BJP as The alternative. Though the euphoria for him has not died down, the trouble is that he is not the CM candidate. Who leads a government has become a critical input into people's decision-making processes today.
A chunk of the powerful Maratha community, as also a section amongst the dalits and the OBCs, had voted for the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls. It was not surprising that Modi started his campaign from Beed, which was Gopinath Munde's constituency, from where his daughter Pankaja Munde is now contesting. Munde's death came as major blow to the BJP for he would have been the party's CM candidate.
Being an OBC, he was also able to rally them around to the BJP. Amit Shah's references to the OBCs at Pankaja's rally recently underscored that whatever the rhetoric, the BJP is as constrained by caste considerations as is any other party. Clearly a four way contest will test the strength of the parties without the fig leaf of alliances, opening up the possibility of several post-poll permutations and combinations.
But it is arithmetic which will determine whether the BJP forms a government on its own, with the help of its smaller allies, or it is compelled to turn once again to its now estranged partner, Shiv Sena. Or whether it reaches out to the NCP it is attacking today-- many believe that the NCP hopes to emerge as the kingmaker.
Or could it be a Shiv Sena led government, supported by the NCP? Modi has taken the risk of going it alone because he not only wants a "Congress-mukt Bharat" but also wants to displace regional outfits in the states—and this may include allies.
His plan: to come to power in as many state capitals as possible, and get a majority in the Rajya Sabha to pass critical bills which are hampering his agenda. Winning Maharashtra, with Mumbai as its financial hub, will be a big feather in his cap.

Chavans  Deshmukhs fight to retain hold as people throng PM s ralliesChavans
(Ashok was given a ministerial…)
AURANGABAD: Two dominant political families in Marathwada region will face a 'make or break' situation in the assembly polls this time. One is that of former CM and Congress MP Ashok Chavan in Nanded and the other of late Congress leader Vilasrao Deshmukh in Latur.
PM Modi's rally in Beed on Saturday seems to have put Chavans and Deshmukhs under pressure. Ashok Chavan's father, Shankarrao Chavan, was the Home Minister in Rajiv Gandhi's cabinet. Ashok was given a ministerial berth in Maharashtra after Shankarrao's death and later became CM after Vilasrao was removed from the post in November 2008.
But after the Adarsh scam exposure Chavan had to step down. He was rehabilitated by the party just before LS polls. He managed to win and become an MP from Nanded.Now Chavan's wife Amita is contesting the seat that he once held.
"We won seven out of nine seats in Nanded. This time a similar thing will happen," said Ashok Chavan. But party insiders say that the Chavans' look nervous because they are being challenged from one side by the BJP and from the other by a rising NCP .
The Deshmukhs face a similar challenge in Latur. Vilasrao's son, Amit, inducted in the state cabinet just before the polls, now faces an uphill task because his own uncle Diliprao Deshmukh was his rival for that berth.

Traders bullish on Infosys on expectations of Vishal Sikka unveiling a growth map

(Analysts said many traders…)
MUMBAI: Savvy traders have placed bullish bets on Infosys ahead of its second quarter earnings due on Friday, October 10. Brokers and analysts said the long positions in Infosys futures and options contracts have been created on hopes that the software exporter's new chief executive officer Vishal Sikka may announce a road map for its future growth.
"Traders can expect 3-4% upside in Infosys stock price on the results day. Most of the positions in the futures segment are long in nature. Bears have gone into hiding from the stock," said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICI Direct. Infy futures open interest, or outstanding positions, at the beginning of the October series is currently around 33 lakh shares, compared to about 25 lakh shares at the beginning of the September series.
Analysts said many traders have squared off their short positions ahead of the results. Infosys saw a strong open interest build-up on the long side last week. The stock has also given a major breakout on the weekly charts above Rs 3,680, said Ashish Chaturmohta, head of technical and derivatives desk at Fortune Equity Broking. Infosys shares closed at Rs 3,847.20 on Wednesday.
Chaturmohta expects the stock to rise another 7-8% in the near term. In Infy call options, the highest open interest is at 4,000 strike in the October series. Analysts said the build-up suggests traders expect stock to rise to Rs 4,000.
"We expect the Infosys stock to move substantially higher in the October series. The open interest in out-of-the-money (OTM) call option (the strike price that is higher than the market price) has been increasing, which is a strong bullish indicator," said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas.
Recently, CLSA has upgraded Infosys rating to 'Buy' from 'Outperform', and has increased its price target to Rs 4,500 from Rs 3,750. Infosys shares have rallied nearly 20% in the last three months, and have outperformed the BSE IT Index, which has gained 17.5%.
The broader benchmark Sensex has gained 4% during the same period. Amar Ambani, head of research at IIFL, said, "IT companies are expected to report strong quarterly performance driven by seasonal project ramp-ups, and currency tailwinds. There is also a high likelihood of incrementally encouraging commentary by most companies on revenue visibility given US growth acceleration."

Gold traders tap price skew on bourses, mint money
Ram Sahgal, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 04.16AM IST
MUMBAI: Bullion traders and punters have been exploiting the price difference in gold contracts traded on two different exchanges to rake in short-term gains. The trade consists in buying or selling the spread between the two contracts on anticipation of its widening or narrowing. Dealers and speculators are finding this opportunity by taking opposite positions in gold contract introduced by farm bourse NCDEX in January this year, and in the contract traded on MCX, the benchmark exchange for metals and energy.
Since the two contracts are different -- the one on NCDEX does not factor in customs duty nor reflect the market premium — while the MCX contract does, the NCDEX contract trades at a perpetual discount to the one on MCX. But the spread can widen or narrow as it did recently and give traders an opportunity to exploit the skew. They buy MCX and sell NCDEX when they expect the spread to widen and vice versa.
Based on the average price of the front month MCX and NCDEX gold futures in September, MCX gold traded at a premium of Rs 2,794 per 10 gm to NCDEX gold hedge last month. But, on September 25, the premium or spread widened by Rs 92 to Rs 2,886 and on September 26 was above the average by Rs 88. Those who purchased the spread - bought MCX gold and sold NCDEX gold hedge - expecting it to widen would have made a maximum gross profit of Rs 9,200 per lot or kilo on September 25. However, the counterparty that sold the spread would have lost an equal amount.
The spread normalised with NCDEX gold having risen 1.63% between September 26 and 29 compared with MCX gold's rise of 0.44%. Here, those who reversed the trade - bought NCDEX and sold MCX gold - would have gained and those who persisted with going long, the spread would have suffered a loss. Such arbitrage also has the effect of raising exchange turnover. On September 25-26, the turnover of gold contracts on both exchanges was much higher than the average daily turnover (ADT) in the nine months through September 30.
Against Rs 4,915 crore ADT of gold on MCX, turnover on September 25 was Rs 6,615 crore and on September 26 was Rs 6,358 crore. On NCDEX, against average turnover of Rs 112 crore, that on September 25-26 more than doubled to Rs 293 crore and Rs 243 crore, respectively.
"We offer spread trading opportunity to our clients in virtually every product and I can say that though NCDEX gold hedge has to attain critical mass, opportunities do present themselves where price difference between that contract and MCX gold can be exploited," said Suresh Nair, ED, Admisi Commodities. "The sharp rise in NCDEX gold hedge turnover in the last week of September indicates arbitrage trades having happened between both the bourses' contracts," said Krishna Naithani, MD, indiabullion. com, a commodity research outfit in Chennai.

India attractive despite fears over Fed rate hike: JPMorganChristian Preussner
(Our expectations are certainly…)
The Federal Reserve is more likely to increate interest rates in the second half of 2015, said Christian Preussner, executive director and head of international client portfolio management at JPMorgan Asset Management. In an interview with Biswajit Baruah, Preussner spoke about the impact of the US rate hike on India and slowing foreign portfolio flows among other matters. Edited excerpts:
We have seen bouts of volatility in emerging markets, including India, in the recent past as investors are getting increasingly worried about US interest rate hike. What are your expectations?
Our expectations are certainly a bit more conservative. Hence, our forecast is that rate hikes in the US will probably happen in the second half of next year. Then there will be more gradual increase in short-term interest rates there. The reason for saying this is that the inflation rate is still quite low at around 1.9-2%, and from that perspective, the Fed is not overly pressured in taking immediate action. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank wants to see a broader continuation of the unemployment rate going down. We would be seeing around 100-basis point rate hike by the end of 2015, and then gradual continuation of hikes into 2016.
How do you see emerging markets like India getting impacted from the Fed rate hike?
If the US is increasing rates, then from net investment perspective, it's more attractive to invest in the US markets. We expect the US GDP growth to be anywhere between 2.5% and 3%. It's definitely an environment where we see high single-digit to low double-digit total returns from US equities going forward. I don't think we are currently getting positive in emerging markets at this point in time. The Indian market has been doing already quite well and still continues to see upside potential.
Foreign portfolio inflows have hit a 7-month low in the last two months. Is this a cause for serious concern for Indian stocks?
The funds coming to India are essentially regional funds and within that India's weightage is 6%, and people are allocating 9-10% weightage to India and that's where most of the flows have to come to India. At this point of time, what is happening is incrementally people are not supporting country-dedicated funds, and within that India-dedicated funds. They are putting more in emerging markets as a theme and so India being overweight is getting the money flow from those types of funds. India is not getting pure India-dedicated money at this point of time. That's where you will see some aberration. But, if you look at the appetite for FIIs to invest, they are waiting for the issuances to come in, and then the flows will automatically happen. I would see it more as an aberration, rather than a worry.
In your global stocks portfolio, how is India positioned?
India is certainly coming out to be 'Overweight' among all the markets. If you look at asset classes which essentially tend to do well during rising US interest rates, it is the higher dividend emerging market equities then pure emerging market equities. If you see India, China, or the Asean region, they all tend to benefit when growth stabilises in the developed markets. The ECB has given a big boost to liquidity by pushing rates to near zero. The US is showing strong strength on the growth side. Japan has been reasonably steady. All this augers well for the emerging market equities because the rise in US interest rates is essentially a response to the growth, and it's not negative. It's essentially in response to the growth being normalised, so you don't require that excess easy monitoring conditions any more.
What kind of returns do you expect from Indian stocks, going forward?
We are talking about the next four years' earnings growth of around 22%. That's a substantial jump from the current 12% or 13%. So, if that is true, we are talking about doubling of markets over the next four years because markets are ultimately a slave of earnings growth. In the interim, there will be news flows, which could keep on impacting the markets, but we are not looking at anything in the short term. We are very confident that the economy is looking to reverse from here and continuously advocating for looking at the markets from three to five-year perspective, because the government itself is now talking about 5-year and 10-year objectives.
 
Which are the sectors you are bullish on?
The sectors we are pondering over are cyclicals; the good companies which are in a position to construct good roads at reasonable cost are going to benefit from the new government policies. Cement is something of a very clean sector which will be a direct beneficiary of the infrastructure development. In the auto segment, the four-wheeler segment is seeing revival, so that is something we are positive on. Within financials, we are concentrating on the private banking side. So these are the things we are positive on.
Pharma and technology stocks have staged a strong comeback in the September quarter. Would you like to advise investors to accumulate these ?
Pharma and IT stocks' valuations are stressed; we are more 'Neutral' on them and have cut our exposure.

(India’s 1.5 lakh small…)
KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: India's 1.5 lakh small to medium cell phone retailers have a new champion — the Aam Aadmi Party's Adarsh Shastri, grandson of former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and a top executive with Apple and Samsung India before he entered politics.
The retailers have been fighting hard to defend themselves against online sellers such as Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal, which are winning over customers by being able to sell phones and tablets at a discount, thus undercutting the brick-and-mortar trade. The AAP leader is seeking to mediate between traders and top brands such as Samsung, Apple and Nokia to curb such discounting. Spokespersons for the top online retailers and the top brands could not be immediately reached for comment.
Shastri, 40, hit the headlines last December by quitting his job at Apple India where he was heading sales for the western region to join AAP ahead of the last general election. He's had meetings with dealers in the north India and market leader Samsung after the shopkeepers threatened to stop selling devices made by the company, Apple and others. ? Shastri is of the view that such threats are counterproductive for the traders and that a better solution can be found that's beneficial to both parties. "Boycotting products of a particular brand is not the right approach," Shastri told ET. "We feel it's not right because it doesn't help the retailer, the brand and the consumer. Brands and retail need to work together," he said, adding that they are waking up to the issue since almost 95% of their sales are still dependent on the offline trade.
It was at one such meeting mediated by Shastri last month that Samsung executives announced to the trade that it will go all out to limit or stop distribution to online sellers who are discounting products. More such meetings are lined up with other brands. To be sure, it's not easy to see how any such resolution won't end up with consumers having to pay more for devices.
Besides this, some brands, such as Motorola and Xiaomi, have decided not to bother with traditional networks at all and are only selling their devices online. Shastri told ETthat he decided to help the cause of the small retailers who approached him, both in his individual capacity and as someone who has been involved with the industry.
Besides this, he's also secretary of the Indian Cellular Association, a grouping that represents manufacturers, distributors and trade partners of the cell phone industry. He also added that AAP won't hesitate to step in and take a more active role since the retail business is the backbone of the Indian economy.
"Wherever the common retailer is being bullied by a large brand or by the large muscle of online retail, we (AAP) will step in. If it is required tomorrow to take up issues of small retailers, the party will absolutely do it," said Shastri. Before his Apple stint, Shastri was with Samsung where he was heading modern trade for the cell phone business.
He was a part of the core team at Samsung that was responsible for the company's rapid rise that saw it overtaking Nokia India to become the market leader, first in smartphones and then the overall mobile business. He also had a stint at Vodafone. These connections are now being put to good use.
"Nokia has been cooperating on this. Some brands are more disruptive than the others, like Samsung and even Apple, to an extent. But Nokia, Motorola and HTC have been reasonably open to the idea of price parity between online and retail channels," said Shastri.
As per estimates by Hong Kong-based market researcher Counterpoint Research, around 10% of smartphone sales comes from online in India, which is estimated to grow up to 15% this Diwali with the top three e-commerce marketplaces — Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal, lining up major discount sales and promotions.

Flipkart s Big Billion Day sale over: You just don t know it yet!Big Billion Day
(There have been a number…)
Flipkart has been advertising for its Big Billion Day sale from the past couple of weeks. There have been a number of deals running on the ecommerce portal since morning 8am across various categories with discounts as high as up to 80%. However, the sale has already come to an end within 7 hours.
In case you don't know what the Big Billion Day Sale is about - Flipkart aims to do business of more than 1 billion in one day on 6th October 2014. We are not sure if Flipkart has already achieved its sale target by 2pm but most of the deals will not be processed anymore. At approx. 2pm, seller accounts of third party vendors on Flipkart have been put as pending i.e no more orders will be taken for the day and products will now show the status as 'out of stock'. A few selected deals will continue to be listed, but essentially the sale is over.
The main reason behind this move is that Flipkart has already received more than 3,00,000 orders in the first 6 hours of the sale - a number that is the limit of their enormous logistics team to process. They will not risk taking more orders and then fail to process them in dispatch tomorrow. A wise strategy to avoid bad mouthing on late delivery, however limiting the sale in such a way will only lead to more complaints from the users.
Throughout the sale, social media was anyway abuzz with complaints against the site crashing and giving errors, orders disappearing from shopper carts and deals going out of stock as soon as they went live. Online shoppers have been continuously checking Flipkart ever hour for new deals and we are not sure hot Flipkart plans to inform its users about the sale end.
Considering the hype created around the sale, Flipkart should have been expecting such traffic and orders, especially since they have already done flash sales that led to their site crashing in the past. At the time of writing of the article, Flipkart's Twitter account is still going on about the sale being continued as announced. However, the end of a one-day sale in just a few hours is not something expected from Flipkart at the time when competing websites Amazon and Snapdeal are continuously offering better deals throughout the day.
Flipkart plans to do another week of similar sale from October 10th to October 16th and we hope that they work on their backend to avoid similar issues during that time.

3 win medicine Nobel for discovering brain s GPSNobel Prize for work on brain's navigation system
By KARL RITTER and MARK LEWIS | Associated Press –  Tue 7 Oct, 2014

Images of the winners of the 2014 Nobel Prize for Medicine, U.S.-British scientist …
STOCKHOLM (AP) — How do we remember where we parked the car? And how do we figure out a shortcut to work when there's a big traffic jam?
The brain, it turns out, has a GPS-like function that enables people to produce mental maps and navigate the world — a discovery for which three scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday.
Husband-and-wife scientists Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser of Norway and New York-born researcher John O'Keefe were honored for breakthroughs in experiments on rats that could help pave the way for a better understanding of human diseases such as Alzheimer's.
"We can actually begin to investigate what goes wrong" in Alzheimer's, said O'Keefe, a dual British-American citizen. He said the findings might also help scientists design tests that can pick up the very earliest signs of the mind-robbing disease, whose victims lose their spatial memory and get easily lost.
It was in London in 1971 where O'Keefe discovered the first component of the brain's positioning system.
He found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room. Other nerve cells were activated when the rat moved to another place. He demonstrated that these "place cells" were building up a map, not just registering visual input.
Decades later, in 2005, the Mosers identified another type of nerve cell — the "grid cell" — that generates a coordinate system for precise "positioning and path-finding," the Nobel Assembly said.
"I made the initial discovery over 40 years ago. It was met then with a lot of skepticism," the 74-year-old O'Keefe said. "And then slowly over years, the evidence accumulated. And I think it's a sign of recognition not only for myself and the work I did, but for the way in which the field has bloomed."
John Kubie of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in New York said this GPS system in the brain is used in such everyday tasks as remembering where a car is parked or taking a new shortcut on the way home. Kubie also said learning about it may teach scientists more about how the brain learns and remembers, even apart from navigating.
Born in Harlem and raised in the South Bronx, O'Keefe received his doctoral degree in physiological psychology at McGill University in Canada before moving to England for postdoctoral work at the University College London.
"If you can survive the South Bronx, you can survive anything," he said.
Monday's award was the fourth time that a married couple has shared a Nobel Prize and the second time in the medicine category.
"This is crazy," an excited May-Britt Moser, 51, said by telephone from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, where she and her husband work.
"This is such a great honor for all of us and all the people who have worked with us and supported us," she said. "We are going to continue and hopefully do even more groundbreaking work in the future."
Edvard Moser, 52, said: "It is really a joint work. Not only are we two people, but we are complementary as well."
The Nobel Assembly said the laureates' discoveries marked a shift in scientists' understanding of how specialized cells work together to perform complex cognitive tasks. They have also opened new avenues for understanding cognitive functions such as memory, thinking and planning.
"Thanks to our grid and place cells, we don't have to walk around with a map to find our way each time we visit a city, because we have that map in our head," said Juleen Zierath, chair of the medicine prize committee.
Half the Nobel prize money of 8 million Swedish kronor (about $1.1 million) goes to O'Keefe and the other half to the Mosers. Each winner also receives a gold medal.
The Nobel Prizes will be handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.
This year's Nobel announcements continue with the physics award on Tuesday, followed by chemistry, literature and peace later this week. The economics prize will be announced next Monday.

(New Delhi wants to exert…)
NEW DELHI: Indian and Swiss tax authorities are expected meet this month in an attempt to break the deadlock on sharing of information on citizens whose names have figured in the controversial 'HSBC list'.
New Delhi wants to exert pressure on the Alp nation following a pact between the world's key economies, G20 , for sharing information on bank accounts and tax offenders.
"There will be a meeting. Details and dates are being worked out," said a finance ministry official, adding that getting Switzerland to share details of beneficial owners of bank account holders in the HSBC list topped India's agenda.
The Narendra Modi government, which set up special investigation team to probe black money on its first day in office, has clearly outlined its focus on tackling the issue.
Indians can legally have bank accounts in foreign lands, but they are supposed to pay tax on the money parked there and also disclose the details to local tax authorities.
In the past few years, there has been a growing perception that Indian businessmen have been stashing away black money in tax havens, taking advantage of the secrecy laws of Swiss banking.
Switzerland buckled under global pressure and agreed to ease its banking secrecy laws in recent years and also signed a revised tax treaty with India in 2011 to facilitate greater flow of information on tax evaders.
But it refused to share information on the accounts mentioned in the so-called 'HSBC list' which India had received from France through a bilateral treaty. It has been widely reported that France had actually received the list after data was stolen by a disgruntled HSBC Geneva employee in 2011.
India has now escalated the issue internationally with the global forum holding discussions on information sharing in cases of stolen data in September.
The Swiss National Bank, on its website, has reported that the total deposit of Indians in their banks have increased to about Rs 14,100 crore at the end of 2013 from about Rs 8,547 crore a year ago. While former finance minister P Chidambaram had sent stern letters to his Swiss counterpart for sharing information, current finance minister Arun Jaitley too followed it up after taking over. And even though Switzerland has begun to respond in some cases, it is still resisting when it comes to the HSBC list.

Maharashtra vs Gujarat ammo against PM; BJP  Modi prime targetsMaharashtra vs Gujarat ammo against PM; BJP, Modi prime targets
htmetro@hindustantimes.com , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 07, 2014

Comments
A week before the state goes to polls, the battle for Maharashtra is increasingly becoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP against all the others.
The poll rhetoric has been about the PM being partisan when it comes to his home state, Gujarat. The parties have accused Modi of insulting Maharashtra by comparing it to Gujarat.
Ironically, ally-turned-foe Shiv Sena and the MNS, which supported Modi for PM, have been most vocal on the Maharashtra versus Gujarat issue. “Modiji should realise he is the prime minister of India and not the chief minister of Gujarat. What message does Modi want to give the people,” asked MNS chief Raj Thackeray, at a rally in Mumbai on Sunday.
On Monday, he aimed a barb at the PM saying if he had to address more than 20 rallies for the Assembly polls, he would campaign for the BJP even in the municipal elections.
Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who had been avoiding a direct attack on Modi, too has started targeting the PM.
While criticising Modi and the BJP on Monday, the Sena mouthpiece Saamana questioned the alleged move to get industrialists to shift base from Maharashtra to Gujarat.
Modi will return to campaign in Maharashtra on Tuesday. He will address 17 rallies, including one in Mumbai on October 9.

Gold held above USD 1,200 an ounce on Tuesday, retaining most of its sharp overnight gains following a bout of profit-taking in the dollar, but optimism over the US economy and possibility of higher rates kept investors wary.
Spot gold slipped slightly to USD 1,203.30 an ounce by 0249 GMT. It had jumped 1.3 percent on Monday in its biggest one-day gain in two months as physical buyers and bargain hunters lent support following earlier lows.
The metal is still not too far from a low of USD 1,183.46 reached earlier on Monday - its weakest since June 2013 - as a strong US jobs report dented its safe-haven appeal.
"The bounce is temporary and gold will likely go lower in the next couple of months," said ANZ analyst Victor Thianpiriya.
"The dollar has gone a long way very quickly, so we are seeing some profit taking. But the overall trend for the dollar is to continue to rally, so that will put downward pressure on gold," he said.
The dollar was beginning to show signs of stabilisation on Tuesday, gaining slightly against a basket of major currencies after a near 1 percent drop in the previous session.
The dollar index has gained for the past 12 consecutive weeks and hit a more than four-year high on Friday after a strong US jobs report.
More robust economic data could boost the dollar and reiterate expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise US interest rates in mid-2015, a move that would hurt non-interest-bearing assets such as gold.
"Technically, if the USD 1,180 level can hold this week, then gold looks likely to push back up to the USD 1,240 - USD 1,250 region," said James Gardiner, metals trader at MKS Group said. "However, the medium-long term bias is still towards the downside."
Markets were also eyeing the return of Chinese buyers on Wednesday. China, the top buyer of gold, has been away since the beginning of the month for its National Day holiday.
Strong buying from China could potentially boost prices.
Among other precious metals, silver slipped 0.2 percent, tracking gold. Platinum and palladium jumped for a second straight day.

The rise of Mecca-hattanInescapable skyscraper next to the Kaaba. (AP Photo)
Associated Press | Mecca | Posted: October 7, 2014 10:49 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 10:52 am
As a child, Osama al-Bar would walk from his home past Islam’s holiest site, the Kaaba, to the market of spice and fabric merchants where his father owned a store. At that time, Mecca was so small, pilgrims could sit at the cube-shaped Kaaba and look out at the serene desert mountains where the Prophet Muhammad once walked.
Now the market and the homes are gone. Monumental luxury hotel towers crowd around the Grand Mosque where the Kaaba is located, dwarfing it. Steep rocky hills overlooking the mosque have been levelled and are now covered with cranes building more towers.
“My father and all the people who lived in Mecca wouldn’t recognise it,” said al-Bar, who is now Mecca’s mayor.
As Muslims streamed into Mecca for the annual Haj this year, they came to a city undergoing the biggest transformation in its history.
Decades ago, this was a low-built city of centuries-old neighbourhoods. Over the years, it saw piecemeal renewal projects. But in the mid-2000s, the kingdom launched its most ambitious overhaul ever with a series of mega-projects that have reshaped Mecca.
Old neighbourhoods have been erased for hotel towers and malls built right up to the edge of the Grand Mosque. Next to the Kaaba soars the world’s third tallest skyscraper, topped by a gigantic clock, which is splashed with coloured lights at night.
“It’s not Mecca. It’s Mecca-hattan. This tower and the lights in it are like Vegas,” said Sami Angawi, an architect who has spent his life studying Haj. “The truth of the history of Mecca is wiped out… with bulldozers and dynamite. Is this development?”
Critics complain the result is stripping the holy city of its spirituality. They also say it is robbing the Haj of its more than 1,400-year-old message that all Muslims are equal before God.
Mecca is revered by millions of Muslims worldwide. They face the Kaaba every day in their prayers. The Grand Mosque is one of the few places in the world where Muslims of all stripes gather — Sunnis and Shiites, secular Muslims, mystics and hardliners.
Overseeing Mecca is also a key source of prestige for Saudi Arabia’s monarchy. The past two kings have adopted the further title of ‘Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques’ to boost their status, referring to Mecca’s Grand Mosque and Muhammad’s mosque in nearby Medina.
Mecca of 1951.
Now the city is being moulded to a particularly Saudi vision that bolsters the rule of the Al Saud royal family.
Two forces shape that vision. One is raw, petrodollar-fuelled capitalism. Mecca’s planners are largely catering to wealthier pilgrims by focusing on construction of five-star hotels. Nearby pilgrims can shop at international chains, including a Paris Hilton store and a gender-segregated Starbucks.
The other force is Wahhabism, the strict, puritanical interpretation continued…

Can Hewlett-Packard survive the tablet trend?
AP Oct 7, 2014, 09.56AM IST
(HP's split is a sign that…)
SAN FRANCISCO: Personal computer sales have been in a slump for years, as customers flock to increasingly powerful smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. Now Hewlett-Packard, the Silicon Valley stalwart that was once the world's biggest seller of personal computers, is splitting off its PC and printing businesses. It's the latest shakeup in a tech industry that's being reshaped by the mobile revolution.
IBM sold its PC business year ago. Dell took its struggles private. Can an HP spinoff focused on personal computing thrive?
"There's a significant transformation going on in that industry, and maybe now HP can make its move," said Forrester tech analyst Peter Burris, one of several analysts who say the iconic tech giant will need to get better at building and selling mobile gadgets if it wants the new spinoff to succeed. HP has stumbled in previous efforts to sell those devices.
HP's split is a sign that CEO Meg Whitman sees more growth and profit opportunity in selling commercial tech products, including data-center hardware, business software and cloud services, some analysts say. That's the business she plans to lead, as chief executive of a new company dubbed Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.
That puts more pressure on the HP Inc. spinoff, which will be led by current PC and printing executive Dion Weisler as CEO. Though it was once the world leader in both segments, HP is now No. 2 to China's Lenovo in PC sales.
Tablets now out-sell laptop computers. And no other major US tech company is focused on selling only PCs. Apple Inc.'s growth in recent years has been fueled by the phenomenal success of its iPhone and iPad devices. Dell also sells commercial computer hardware and software. Even Lenovo is purchasing IBM's server business and taking over the Motorola smartphone division from Google Inc.
PC sales aren't going away entirely, to be sure. There are still some cases where PCs are more useful than smaller-screen devices, especially in the workplace, said Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. The industry sold more than 310 million desktop and laptop computers last year, and one out of six were sold by Palo Alto, California-based HP. But global sales fell 10 per cent in 2013 and are likely to fall another 4 per cent this year, according to the IDC research firm. PC sales should level off in 2015, forecasts O'Donnell.
"They can be profitable," he said, "but it's a stable, flat kind of market."
Printer ink has been a major source of profit for HP in years past. But printing also is a stagnating business, as more people store photos and files online and view them primarily on their phones and tablets. Even so, tying the printing business to PCs should provide a stable source of revenue for HP Inc. for some years to come, said tech analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy.
HP also could expand that business to include 3D printing systems and home networks for Internet-enabled thermostats and other gadgets, since many printers today are part of a home network, he added.
Jettisoning PCs doesn't necessarily make Hewlett-Packard Enterprise is a slam dunk. Analysts say HP has some good data-center products, but Whitman faces challenges in upgrading its commercial software and technology services businesses.
"Does this mean a new dawn is here for Palo Alto?" asked Burris. "No, it doesn't. It means that HP is going to have to do a lot of hard work to prove itself."
Hewlett-Packard has posted revenue declines in 11 of the past 12 quarters and laid off tens of thousands of people in recent years as it attempts to cut costs. During its most recent quarter HP reported revenue of $27.6 billion, a 1 per cent annual gain. It marked HP's first year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue since late 2011. Printers and PCs contributed roughly half the company's annual revenue, with the rest coming from commercial computer systems, software and technology services.
HP first considered breaking off the PC unit three years ago, when Leo Apotheker was CEO. But the idea was controversial and Whitman rejected it after she took his place in 2011 and launched a lengthy turnaround. She said Monday that HP has now shored up its business enough to support the split. The company believes the two new units will be worth more separately and be able to grow more quickly apart than they can together.
HP is expected to complete its latest round of layoffs, between 11,000 to 16,000 people, this month. Total job cuts will now stand at 55,000, up from a planned 50,000. In an interview with CNBC Monday, Whitman left open the possibility for further layoffs as the separate businesses determine their cost structure going forward.
HP shares rose almost 5 per cent to close at $36.87. The stock is up nearly 32 per cent since the beginning of the year.

Mumbai, Oct 7:  
Shares of Ballarpur Industries surged nearly 14 per cent today as International Finance Corporation said it will invest USD 100 million (about Rs 616 crore) in Bilt Paper BV, a step-down subsidiary of the paper manufacturer, in lieu of fresh shares.
Ballarpur Industries’ scrip zoomed 13.49 per cent to Rs 18.50 on the BSE.
On the NSE, it surged 13.84 per cent to Rs 18.50.
“BPBV has entered into definitive agreements with IFC for subscription of new shares worth $100 million at an implied pre-money valuation of $600 million,” Ballarpur Industries had said in a BSE filing yesterday.
“This will result into a shareholding of IFC in BPBV of 14.29 per cent,” the company had said.
Bilt Paper is also exploring the possibility of listing of its shares at an overseas stock exchange.
The subscription of shares is subject to fulfilment of conditions set out in the definitive documents, it said.
In June, Ballarpur had said that BPBV is evaluating and exploring options with IFC for receiving potential investment from IFC, in a combination of debt and/or equity in BPBV and/ or its step—down subsidiaries.

Facebook closes $19 bn buy of WhatsAppFacebook closes $19 bn buy of WhatsApp
PTI
Facebook, the world’s biggest social network, announced the buyout of the WhatsApp messenger service, used by 600 million people, in February and US authorities approved the deal in April.
San Francisco, Oct 7:  
Facebook today completed its USD 19 billion buy of mobile messaging application WhatsApp, appointing one of the startup’s co-founders to the social network’s board as part of the deal.
“We are looking forward to connecting even more people around the world, and continuing to create value for the people who use WhatsApp,” Facebook said in a statement emailed to AFP.
Along with joining the Facebook board of directors, Jan Koum will remain chief of WhatsApp.
Koum’s salary will be a dollar a year, according to a filing Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The symbolic annual pay mirrors that of Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg.
WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton will remain with the company under terms of the acquisition, which promises “inducement grants” of millions of shares of stock that will incrementally vest during the coming four years for Koum and Acton if they remain with the company, according to Facebook.
European Union regulators on Friday cleared the buyout of the WhatsApp mobile messaging service by Facebook, despite opposition by telecom companies afraid of the growing power of US technology giants.
In a statement explaining its approval of the USD 19 billon deal, the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said Facebook and WhatsApp were “not close competitors” and that consumers would continue to have a “wide array of choices“.
“We have carefully reviewed this proposed acquisition and come to the conclusion that it would not hamper competition in this dynamic and growing market,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

Growth in services activity picked up pace in September as order books filled up at a faster rate, a business survey showed on Tuesday.
The HSBC Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 51.6 in September from 50.6 in August, reversing a slowdown seen in the previous two months.
A reading above 50 signifies growth while anything below the level denotes contraction.
The new business sub-index climbed to 52.4 from 51.9, signalling robust demand.
"Service sector activity bottomed out in September thanks to stronger new business flows," said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at survey sponsor HSBC.
In what might also give some respite to the domestic economy, which has long struggled with high inflation, the sub-index measuring output price growth fell to a near four-year low.
The country's annual consumer price inflation eased in August to 7.80 per cent from 7.96 per cent in July. Wholesale prices also rose at a slower clip during that month.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), however, does not appear to be in a hurry to ease monetary policy and hinted last week that it would not do so until it was confident that consumer inflation could be reduced to a target of 6 per cent by January 2016.
Activity in the private sector has expanded steadily since May, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a landslide mandate that created a wave of optimism over the country's economic prospects.
But the lack of sweeping reforms by the Modi government so far has taken the sheen off those hopes.
"A pick up in reform effort is sorely needed to put growth on a firmer footing and address supply side risks to inflation," Neumann said.
The survey showed firms' confidence regarding future business grew at the slowest pace in a year last month.

Associated Press | Washington | Posted: October 7, 2014 10:56 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:16 pm
The Pentagon has spent as much as $1.1 billion on U.S. military operations against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria since the mission began in mid-June, including more than $62 million alone in Navy airstrikes and Tomahawk cruise missiles.

U.S. Central Command, in data released Monday, said that the Navy has dropped roughly 185 munitions, including 47 cruise missiles launched from ships in the region. Central Command said Air Force fighter jets have far exceeded those numbers, launching close to 1,000 munitions. The data released Monday broke out the $62 million spent on Navy munitions, but provided no cost estimates for Air Force munitions.

The bulk of the Navy costs were for the 47 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired by American warships in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea that targeted the Khorasan Group, an al-Qaida cell, in eight locations west of the city of Aleppo in Syria. The group was said to be plotting imminent attacks on American and Western interests, and it was one of the key targets two weeks ago when the U.S. first began airstrikes into Syria.

Dont get carried away by promotional airfares  book in advance for best deals: ExpertsAgent
(These days your best fare…)
MUMBAI: Avid travellers are in a foul mood. Many of them complain that it is no longer possible to get "the cheapest" air ticket. It really doesn't matter when you book; it all boils down to your luck, they say. The old theory of getting the best rate if a ticket is booked well in advance doesn't hold true anymore, most of them swear. These days your best fare remains the best only till you run into a fellow traveller at the airport, who managed to get tickets much cheaper, despite booking much later.
However, travel experts dismiss this claim. They say that booking well in advance is still the best option available to individuals. This is what a typical traveller had to say about her experience trying to book tickets this year for Diwali holidays: "When I first checked the tickets two months ago, they were really cheap.
By the time I sat down to make the reservation the next day, the prices were exorbitant. I waited for two weeks, and booked my tickets at what I thought were an okay rate, only to find out two days later that tickets were available much cheaper suddenly. When it happens to you once, it is called an accident. But, when it happens often, you are either accident prone or you are wasting too much time looking for a ticket at best price."
Rajesh Rateria , managing director, Cirrus Travels , says that travellers don't have an option, but to plan their travels and book much in advance, especially, if their travel dates coincide with a long weekend or any traditional festivals. "The airlines anticipate great demand on such occasions and chances of you getting a cheap ticket are almost nil," he says. "Airlines would stop selling low-bucket fares and shift to selling high-bucket fares as the date nears closer. This might happen even if there are low fare vacant seats. So, it won't be a great idea to wait till the last moment," adds Rateria.
Pradip Lulla , managing director, Cupid Travels, says that dynamic pricing almost rules out a cheaper fare at the last moment. "The airlines would add the discount it has already given to advance bookers into the last minute fares. If they don't do it, they will suffer losses," says Lulla, who is also the national general secretary of Travel Agent Federation of India . Mystery of Low Fares If the old rule still works, how is it that some of your fellow travellers always manage to get better fares?
Travel experts say that the mystery could be explained with the so-called promotional offers airlines come out every now and then. Remember, the Rs 1 fares offered by various airlines just a few months ago? Or the introductory fares offered by the new entrant AirAsia? Well, seasoned travel agents say that due to these fares, some people might have landed cheaper rates, but they warn against waiting for such fares. "It is true that such offers keep coming every now than then. But, it is not necessary that the fares would be available for the dates you are planning to travel. Even if the dates match, it is not necessary that you would get the tickets, as only some limited seats are available on such offers," says Lulla. Experts say that individuals should be doubly sure of the dates before they make reservations as most of these offers are non-refundable.
In fact, several people tend to cancel their tour when they plan a journey on the basis of great fare offer from an airline. "If you have to cancel the tickets for some reason, you would lose the entire money. Airlines don't usually entertain requests for refunds," says Lulla. According to experts, this is why travellers should focus more on their travel plans than such discount offers. Rateria still advises his clients to plan their itinerary carefully and book well in advance to rule out any unpleasant surprises, as a holiday is more than just airfare.

Tips to write the best essay when applying to study abroadThe key skill needed while applying to study abroad

7 Ways To Build A Professional Network In School
By Mr.Jaideep Gupta
The advent of social media, mobile phones and popular flicks has paved way to a new language among students. While the colloquial lingo students’ use makes communication easier, it can prove to be a bane when it comes to writing academic essays. Students now are finding it increasingly difficult to write essays that express their views and purpose in a formal language. A well written essay/SOP can exponentially increase the student’s admission chance in a desired university.
For admission to the university programmes in US, students are expected to write essays on specific topics. The purpose of any admission essay is not to test the student’s abilities as a writer, but to check on his clarity of thought and his perception of the world, and whether his values match with the ones of the university.
More than 75% of the students applying abroad think they have done a good job with an essay, if the content is filled with words scouted from a dictionary. Instead of the focus being on dazzling the admission’s officer by using jargon or flowery language, it should be on highlighting why the student has decided to pursue a specific course in a particular university. In countries other than US, students are expected to write a Statement of Purpose (SOP), where the focus should be on explaining why they intend to study in the country and what they intend to do after completing the course, besides a very justifiable reason for selected the course.
When writing on any topic, students must first organise their thoughts and create a few rough drafts before arriving at the final version. Relevance of the topic to the question asked and coherence between paragraphs is likely to create a favourable impression on the admission’s officer. Students should also make room for co-curricular and extracurricular activities that they have participated in, as colleges are often on the lookout for well-rounded individuals.
Seemingly inconsequential but common mistakes can negatively impact admission chances. The essay is any student’s only chance of enthralling the admission’s officer with his uniqueness. Petty errors in punctuation, spelling mistakes, wrong usage of prepositions or tenses can mar this opportunity. When using quotes or references, special attention should be paid to getting the correct name of the individual quoted. Most university applications are to be filled online in pre-designated spaces within the application form. Hence, the prescribed word limit should also be kept in mind. It is always better if the total number of words is close to the permissible number i.e. neither too short nor too lengthy.
When applying to more than one college, it is vital that the content be customised to suit specific college requirements. Matters that are controversial or could hurt religious sentiments should be avoided. If a controversial topic is unavoidable, it is always safe to keep it balanced. Fresh and diverse thoughts on matters will catch an admissions officer’s attention.
Students can get their essays re checked by their teachers before sending them to the universities. There are also many service providers in the market who specialise in expert guidance on university application essay/SOP writing.

Buy travel insurance first before you go abroadBuy travel insurance first before you go abroad

(Every year, roughly 14 million…)
The extreme cold wave in the US last winter and the floods in Kashmir this year are grim reminders that natural calamities come without warnings. While an individual can do little to stop nature's fury, he can protect himself against the consequences. For instance, a travel insurance policy can't stop a hurricane, but it can compensate you if you miss a connecting flight due to inclement weather.
Every year, roughly 14 million Indians travel abroad. According to a survey by ICICI Lombard General Insurance, less than half of them buy travel insurance (see graphic).
In some countries, it's mandatory for you to buy travel insurance. You won't be allowed to enter the US or some West European countries if you don't have travel insurance. This is because the cost of medical care in these countries can be prohibitive.
In the US, the average charge for a hospital room is Rs 2.57 lakh per day (see graphic).
Yet, as the ICICI Lombard survey shows, many don't buy travel insurance during foreign trips. Sanjay Datta , chief of underwriting and claims, ICICI Lombard General Insurance says, "Many travellers believe that since they already have a health insurance policy, it will cover their medical needs even when overseas. But an ordinary health policy may not cover foreign travel."
What's covered
Travel insurance typically covers baggage loss, medical expenses, emergency evacuation and loss of passport.
Some policies even cover dental treatment but the premium for such plans is very high.
Policies also cover travel inconveniences (flight delays, cancellation, trip curtailments, and missed connections).
So, you don't need to worry about cost of rebooking or delays and cancellation.
Though policies can be bought online with a click of the mouse, study the features in detail before you buy one.
Travel policies have lots of exclusions . For instance, a normal policy does not cover medical expenses due to an accident during adventure sports.
For that, one has to take an additional cover, which comes at a hefty premium.

Railways to have branded  ready-to-eat  food from NovREAD MORE ON » Kellogg | Indian Railways
To ensure quality food for passengers, the state-run transporter is ready with the draft policy to allow reputed brands to serve meals on board.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Rail travelers will get branded 'ready-to-eat' meals from next month in all express and mail trains.
Aiming to ensure quality and hygienic food for passengers, the state-run transporter is ready with the draft policy to allow reputed brands such as ITC, MTR, Maiyas, Kohinoor Foods and Kellogg's to serve meals on board.
In the first phase, the services of branded pre-cooked foods would be made available in all mail and express trains having pantry car. The branded food would be served to passengers as an 'add on' option in addition to other standard items as part of catering service on these trains.
The passengers could choose from a menu card indicating the 'ready to eat' items, its brand, weight and rates. The food would be served hot and in a sealed pack.
An official said that zonal railways would fix the rates for the pre-cooked food. He, however, said the rates will not be different from the existing rates charged by the caterers.
Railways expect that given the high volume and branding opportunity, the companies would agree on charging reasonable rates.
The zonal railways would select the companies and branded 'ready-to-eat' items to ensure variety, quality, hygiene and affordable choices for the passengers. The companies have to meet the national and international quality norms.
The move came after the railways, which serves cooked food such as dal, chapatti and rice, received positive feedback on branded pre-cooked food.
On a trial basis, the transporter served pre-cooked foods on premium trains which are on high-demand routes. As the fares in such trains are decided by dynamic pricing, the tickets are booked online only and the rates are inclusive of food.
The power to shortlist firms has been given to zonal railways as the transporter would try to add regional cuisine such as upma, idli, sambhar in trains from the South, and dal and shahi paneer in those from the North.
The railways had promised to introduce pre-cooked (ready to eat) food of reputed brands in the budget in order to improve quality and hygiene and provide variety.

dynamic fare system
(The rates of the tatkal tickets…)
NEW DELHI: Half of the tatkal tickets on 80 trains have become costlier with the Railways deciding to partially implement the dynamic fare system under which charges will depend on demand.
The decision, clearly aimed at mopping up more revenues by the cash-strapped Railways, comes in the midst of festival season when there is a big rush of train travellers.
"It has been decided that 50 per cent of the existing tatkal quota ticket shall be sold under dynamic fare scheme," said a senior Railway Ministry official today.
As per the scheme, 50 per cent of tatkal quota tickets would be sold under the existing system and the subsequent 50 per cent under 'premium tatkal' quota of dynamic pricing.
It will mean more the demand, more the cost. The 'Premium Tatkal Ticket' scheme will be applicable to 80 trains from October one and like Premium train, the scheme will be available online only.
Railway Board Member (Traffic) D P Pandey said, "The Premium Tatkal ticket scheme has been launched for 80 popular trains. All zones have been asked to identify five popular trains in their respective zone.
"We will see the response and then we will decide on extending the scheme to other trains."
He emphasised that only 50 per cent of the tatkal tickets will be sold under the dynamic fare system while the rest will be sold on regular tatkal fare basis.
There is tremendous rush for tickets during the festive season as passengers prefer to travel to their home towns for celebrating Dusshera and Diwali.
However, Railways has described the scheme as a preventive measure to deal with the menace of touts.
"There were reports of genuine passengers being fleeced by touts. This will help facilitating needy passengers to get tickets," the official said.
The scheme, applicable on selected trains, will increase the prices of tatkal tickets and as an end result the train fare.
Northern Railway has identified five trains including Saptakranti Express, two Mumbai Rajdhani trains and Vaishali Express to implement Premium Tatkal scheme.
Some trains which have been identified for implementation of the scheme are Hyderabad-New Delhi Andhra Pradesh Express, Hyderabad-Hazrat Nizamuddin Dakshin Express, Secunderabad-Howrah Falaknuma Express, Kacheguda-Bangalore Express and Secunderabad-Patna Express.
The tatkal scheme currently covers around 2677 trains. According to Railway figures, around 1.71 lakh seats, of the 11.57 lakh available, are up for booking under the tatkal scheme.
It is also a prominent source of income for the Railways, raking in about Rs 1000 cr last year.
"The scheme has been launched to deal with the problem of touts. There were reports of genuine passengers being fleeced by touts. This will help facilitating needy passengers to get tickets," a senior Railway Ministry official said.
The scheme, applicable on selected train, will increase the prices of tatkal tickets and as an end result the train fare. Railways is also running 50 premium trains on dynamic fare system, like flights.
It had increased tatkal charges last year in April by ten per cent of the basic fare for reserved second class sitting and 30 per cent of basic fare for all other classes.
NDA government has increased train fares of all classes by 14.2 per cent on June 25.

M-Pesa, launched in April 2013 in India, is a unique mobile money transfer and payment service being offered by Vodafone that facilitates person-to-person (P2P) and customer-to-business (C2B) transactions.
The service will allow customers to download mobile application "139 Railways Reservation " once, post which it does not require any data connection for registration or booking of tickets, the telco in a statement said.

Vodafone customers can download the application by sending an SMS "TICKET" to 111. Once accessed, the app prompts users with interactive and guided menu options towards booking tickets.
The service, the telco said, is highly secure and available only through the mobile number which is registered with IRCTC during the registration process.
In addition, subscribers can access information on partial and full cancellation. Information on PNR status can also be accessed through the mobile app. In case of cancellations, relevant refund will be credited to the customer's Vodafone M-Pesa wallet.
"This (partnership) would open up and extend the convenience and efficiency of e-Commerce and online services to those unbanked millions who are operating with cash and are otherwise excluded from this eco-system," Suresh Sethi, Business Head - M-Pesa at Vodafone India said in a statement.
Sethi said that they are extending a highly safe and secure technology platform that works even for customers who do not have an Internet connection.
Bharat BPO Services CEO Jatinder Verma said that innovative offering will make rail e-ticket booking easy for customers as they can book tickets from anywhere.
"This is the real edge of mobility that will touch new dimensions in mobile usage. The relationship with Vodafone M-Pesa and their tremendous reach towards the masses will definitely make this initiative a success." Verma added.
In June 2013, Sunil Mittal-headed Bharti Airtel had also entered into a similar arrangement with IRCTC to offer e-reservations through its mobile wallet service Airtel Money .

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Leaves Hospital
Agencies | Updated On: October 06, 2014 14:55 (IST)
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been discharged from the government-run AIIMS hospital in Delhi where he was admitted last week to recover from an infection that followed a stomach operation to treat diabetes.
Mr Jaitley, 61, who doubles up as Defence Minister, was kept at an isolation ward at AIIMS.
Last month, he had to skip a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations in Australia.
He was admitted to a private hospital in New Delhi on September 1 for gastric bypass surgery to treat weight gain he has suffered because of a long-standing diabetic condition.
He was re-admitted to hospital last week and moved to the isolation ward in a government hospital on Sunday to reduce the number of people visiting him after he contracted an infection, doctor Pradeep Chowbey told Reuters.
His absence from two key ministries for almost a month had raised concerns about slow decision-making, including delays to appointments of officials such as the chief economic adviser in the finance ministry.

iPhone 6 pre-booking starts in India on Oct 7Description Toggle
1 - 25 / 30
NEW DELHI: Apple today announced that pre-booking for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will start in India starting from October 7.
Apple India in a statement said: 'iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be available in India beginning Friday, October 17, from an expansive network of Apple Authorized Resellers. Customers can pre-order iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus beginning Tuesday, October 7.'
Apple India did not reveal the price at which it will sell the phones in India but added that pricing details will be soon made available by Apple's partners: Ingram Micro, Redington, Rashi Peripherals and Reliance.
On September 10, Apple launched the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which boasts of bigger screens.
The iPhones have curved edges and bigger screens that measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, up from just four inches on the iPhone 5S. The smaller one is 6.9 mm thick and the 5.5-inch version is 7.1 mm thick.
The larger iPhones have what Apple is calling "Retina HD" displays.
The iPhone 6 comes with more than 1 million pixels -- a third more pixels than the iPhone 5S. The iPhone 6 Plus has 2 million pixels, double the iPhone 5S' screen.
Both iPhones feature an 8 megapixel camera with a new sensor that Apple claims will help the camera focus faster.
The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus feature Apple's new A8 processor, which is 25 percent faster than the iPhone 5S.
The M8 co-processor will allow fitness apps to tell the difference between walking and biking and even measure your relative elevation.
In a first week of its launch, Apple said that more than 10 million of its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6Plus devices were sold on the first weekend.
"Sales of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6Plus have surpassed our expectations for the launch weekend and we could not be happier," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement Monday.
But the new phones faced criticism over their bendability, dubbed 'bendgate'. Social media and online forums have been abuzz with comments about how the new phones can bend when placed in back pockets or while wearing skinny jeans.
Users of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus also complained about some glitches in their latest operating system, the iOS 8.
Some users had complained of sluggish Wi-Fi, dwindling battery life and dropped calls after moving to iOS 8.
Users of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus complained about a drop in cellular service and inability to use the fingerprint-reading Touch ID after updating to iOS 8.0.1.

Stop praising Modi  Kerala Cong tells TharoorStop praising Modi, Kerala Cong tells Tharoor
KPM BASHEER
Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee-I vice-president MM Hassan
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor
Kochi, October 6:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s selection of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor as one of the nine ambassadors of the Clean India campaign, and Tharoor’s subsequent adulation of Modi, have irked the Congress.
Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee-I (KPCC-I ) vice-president MM Hassan on Monday publicly asked Tharoor to stop praising Modi.
The KPCC-I is considering disciplinary action against Tharoor, whose remarks went against the party policy, he said.
“As a first step, we are asking him to stop praising Modi as his stance goes totally against the Congress’ ideals,” he added.
Kerala State Youth Congress President M Liju alleged that Tharoor is becoming a part of Modi’s communal agenda. Liju also criticised the former Union Minister for associating himself with Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
In a recent article, Tharoor said he feels honoured by the Prime Minister’s invitation to join the campaign.
“Which Indian worthy of the name would not be humbled to be tapped by his Prime Minister for a national cause?” he wondered. “I was the only politician, and worse, the only Congressman, on his list.”
He further recalled that Modi had, a year ago, invited him to exhort young Indians to vote.
Tharoor praised Modi for his initiative to clean up India and for using his prime ministerial position “to drive change from the top” as no individual Indian “can match the reach of a prime ministerial initiative.” “When a PM picks up a broom, it is news; the country pays attention,” he remarked.
“Let’s also remember that the Swachh Bharat campaign is an attempt by PM Modi to give a new fillip to a national effort of successive governments — one that has failed to achieve its objectives for years,” Tharoor said rather bluntly in his article. This is being construed as a snub mostly to the previous Congress governments.
Question of honour
Responding to Tharoor’s article, former Union Minister Mani Shankar Iyer had said he was “honoured” not to be invited by Modi.
Responding to Hassan’s criticism, Tharoor said he is astonished by the allegation that he is turning pro-BJP. “Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party’s core Hindutva agenda,” he tweeted.
Tharoor, a former UN bureaucrat and author, had courted controversy earlier too for praising Modi.

4G players seek more time to meet rollout target4G players seek more time to meet rollout target

Blame lack of tech, slow government processes for delay
New Delhi, October 6:  
Four years after receiving 4G spectrum, telecom operators have approached the Department of Telecom seeking another five years to complete their rollout obligation.
The operators, including Airtel, Reliance Jio and Aircel, have made a joint plea to extend the deadline, through industry body Cellular Operators Association of India.
Spectrum to offer broadband services on mobile devices was allocated in 2010 with specific rollout targets. The five-year period in which the operators were supposed to achieve the rollout expires in 2015. But until now, barring Airtel, none of the other players which bought spectrum has been able to even start services. Reliance Jio is in the process of putting in place its network and content and is expected to launch services early next year.
Earlier, a top Reliance executive had told BusinessLine that the company will be able to meet the rollout target. Airtel has launched the service in four cities but managed to get only a few lakh subscribers.
Aircel has also launched in a handful of cities, while Tikona and Augere are yet to announce plans.
The operators face huge penalties if they fail to meet the rollout target. Going by the current status, most operators are bound to miss their rollout obligations.
Operators’ stance
The operators have blamed the lack of a global technology ecosystem, slow government processes and inadequate policy support for the delay in meeting the rollout target.
“As the DoT is well aware, the inability of the operators to even launch the services on the allocated broadband spectrum is primarily on account of the delay in development of the requisite device and network ecosystem, a prime factor, which is predominantly out of the control of the telecom service providers,” the COAI note said, urging the DoT to set a more realistic deadline for the roll-out target.

Cleanliness lessons in curriculum: Modi invokes Nehru  Indirastate politics
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday invoked the Congress’s biggest icons, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, while hitting out at the Congress for neglecting Nehru’s legacy.
Campaigning for the Haryana Assembly election in Hisar on Monday, Mr. Modi said: “Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister, was Chacha Nehru to children and I would like that on November 14, his birth anniversary, children of all schools be given lessons in cleanliness and hygiene.”
The cleanliness campaign should continue till the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on November 19, he said and urged all schools and anganwadis to participate. “Those who want to pay tribute to Chacha Nehru should sit with the children he loved so much and tell them how to lead a healthier life.”
The Prime Minister, who also addressed rallies at Kurukshetra and Faridabad, attacked the Haryana government for allegedly clearing a controversial land deal involving Robert Vadra and targeted Indian National Lok Dal leader Om Prakash Chautala.
“There is a baba who got his photo clicked with me at a public function. He is going around with this photo, saying that he will offer us support after elections. Forgive me baba, I have the support of 125 crore Indians. I don’t need the support of people from Tihar,” said Mr. Modi in an apparent reference to Mr. Chautala who has been convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail in a teachers’ recruitment scam case.
Mr. Modi urged the Election Commission to take note of the recent approval of the land deal in favour of Mr. Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

White House rebukes NetanyahuIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu listens as President Barack Obama speaks during their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2014. (Source: AP)
Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: October 7, 2014 9:34 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 11:19 am
The Obama Administration has rebuked Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu after the latter said the US criticism of Israeli settlement building ran counter to the American values.
“We would note that the Prime Minister appeared only to be addressing our concerns about Silwan, and seemed to ignore our concern over reports that the Israeli government had moved forward the planning process in the sensitive area of Givat Hamatos in east Jerusalem,” White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, said.
“That action is contrary to Israel’s stated goal of negotiating a permanent status agreement with the Palestinians, and it would send a very troubling message if they were to proceed with tenders or construction,” he said.
Earnest was responding to questions about the statement made by Netanyahu in an interview over the weekend.
“It’s against the American values. And it doesn’t bode well for peace. The idea that we’d have this ethnic purification as a condition for peace, I think it’s anti-peace,” Netanyahu told the CBS news.
The White House rebuked it.
“I did see the Prime Minister’s remarks, and it did seem odd for him to try to defend the actions of his government by saying that our response did not reflect American values. The fact is, American policy has been clear and unchanged under several administrations, both Democrat and Republican,” Earnest said.
“We oppose any unilateral actions that attempt to prejudge final status issues, including the status of Jerusalem. These can only be legitimately determined through direct negotiations between the parties that this President has worked hard to try to facilitate,” he said.
He said when it came to American values, the country lent unwavering support to Israel.
It’s American values that have led us to fight for and secure funding to strengthen Israel’s security in tangible ways,” he said.
“It’s American values that have led us to fund and build an Iron Dome system that has protected the lives of countless innocent Israeli citizens. It’s American values that have led the US to fully support Israel’s right to defend itself. And it’s American values that have led us to defend Israel in a variety of international forums, including a variety of UN forums,” he added.
“So it’s clear how American values dictate or at least guide our thinking when it comes to our unwavering support for the nation of Israel,” he said.

Cos foresee 2007-like boom for talent at all levels | Jobs with crore-plus salariesAjit Isaac
(The real recruitment spree…)
MUMBAI: Boom times back in the job market? Recruiters think so. Hiring data for the July-September quarter shows a two-year high and more than half a dozen recruiters reckon levels last seen during the 2007 boom will return in the next few months. The real recruitment spree will come when employers focus on talent for new jobs. Right now, the hiring is brisk thanks mostly to vacant positions being filled.
Top-Level hiring to be up after lag
For Bangalore-based Ikya Human Capital Solutions , the July-September period topped recruitment closures of the last seven years. "We closed around 4,000 positions in all, including 3,000 in temporary staffing. This is more than any quarter till seven years ago," said Ajit Isaac , chairman and MD of the recruitment firm that looks after middle order and temporary hiring. "There is a demand for managing directors in automotive, manufacturing and infrastructure projects," said R Suresh, managing director of RGF Executive Search.
The Japan-headquartered company also touched a 13-month high in its India numbers and closures were significantly higher than same period last year." Another recruitment company that looks mainly at IT middle management hiring said the two-year high includes counter-offers. "This is also good news because it shows mobility in markets and that candidates are willing to look at changes," said the company head, who refused to be named. Also clocking in its best quarter in a couple of years was Bangalore-based The Head Hunters.
Mandates for this recruitment company come from ecommerce, engineering and consumer sectors, according to Kris Lakshmikanth , chief executive of The Head Hunters (India). This September, the recruitment firm hired four senior members for a Canadian company that has operations in Chennai; the posts had been vacant for a while. Staffing companies like Randstad India as well have touched their two-year best this September. "Action from the new government is yet to be seen on ground but we expect larger orders to come in," said Aditya Narayan Mishra, president (staffing) at Randstad India. TeamLease clocked in its highest number of closures in 18 months.
"The number of openings per client has gone up. Earlier, if they wanted one person for the post of a bank manager, they are asking for five now," said co-founder and senior vice-president Rituparna Chakraborty . Brisk hiring will, however, not be in conjunction with any drastic changes in salary structures. Increment levels will be around 15-40% when changing jobs and compensation packages will see more long-term incentives. Hiring for top level talent is also expected to pick up - but after a lag.

London Underground workers to strike work Oct 14-16London Underground workers to strike work Oct 14-16
PTI
Tweet
London, Oct 7:  
Workers on London’s Underground train system will stage a 48 hour strike next week, the transport union said, risking travel chaos in a long-running dispute over ticket offices closures.
Members of the 80,000-strong Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union announced a strike next week from the evening of October 14 to the evening of October 16.
The walkout coincides with strikes by health workers, civil servants and council workers across Britain in separate pay, jobs and spending cuts disputes.
The RMT said that insufficient progress had been made in talks over the closures, which the union says will risk hundreds of jobs and safety standards in the system known as the “Tube“.
“The cuts, currently being bulldozed through, would de-staff whole areas of the Tube system at a time of surging passenger demand and would make evacuation and other basic safety procedures a physical impossibility,” said RMT leader Mick Cash.
“RMT will not stand back and allow Government-driven austerity cuts to hollow out the Tube system and leave it as a dangerous shell.”
Cash was last month elected new general secretary of the RMT, replacing the powerful Bob Crow, famous for leading numerous strikes that shut down the underground system.
Cash promised there would be “no deviation” from Crow’s strategy under his leadership.
London’s Underground system is the oldest in the world and carries around three million passengers daily.
The underground system management argue that few tickets are bought at booths due to machines and touch—payment systems, and say staff should be stationed on platforms instead.

6 die  21 000 infected by dengue virus outbreak in southernChinaPrint
Associated Press | Posted: October 7, 2014 11:50 am
The dengue virus has killed six people and infected more than 21,000 in southern China’s worst outbreak of the mosquito-transmitted disease in about two decades, officials said Tuesday.
Authorities in worst-affected Guangdong province attribute the severity of this year’s outbreak to exceptionally hot and wet weather, plus increasing travel by residents to regions where dengue is endemic, especially Southeast Asia.
The Guangdong health agency said on its website that 21,527 people had been infected by Sunday, with more than 1,000 new infections per day. Other provinces reported a few dozen cases.
In the Guangdong capital of Guangzhou, authorities dispatched teams to spray insecticide to kill the mosquitoes that spread the virus, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and rashes. It usually is not fatal, but can be especially severe for younger victims.

Rajasthan: Two suspended after woman allegedly commits suicide in policestationSwaropganj SHO Ishwar Pareek and woman constable Tarawati were suspended and the rest of the staff in the police station were sent to police lines with immediate effect.
Express News Service | Jaipur | Posted: October 7, 2014 11:42 am
The custodial death of a 20-year-old woman in a police station in Sirohi Monday led to suspension of several police officials and a probe was initiated by the state government. Mamata, who was arrested in a murder case on Sunday, had gone to the washroom attended by two policewomen but allegedly committed suicide by strangulating herself with her dupatta.
The circumstances of the death were found dubious by the state women commission that has ordered a probe in addition to an inquiry initiated by the Sirohi district collector.
Swaropganj SHO Ishwar Pareek and woman constable Tarawati were suspended and the rest of the staff in the police station were sent to police lines with immediate effect. Sirohi Superintendent of Police Rajiv Pachar said, “The deceased was to be produced before a court on Monday for police custody while her brothers, Mukesh and Suresh, who too were arrested in the same murder case, were already sent to police remand. In the initial inquiry in the murder case, it was found that Mamata, a divorcee, was in a relationship with Ashok whom she eliminated along with her two brothers.”
State Women Commission chairperson Lad Kumari Jain said it was a suspected case of honour killing and that the commission doubted the sequence of events. Jain said that a team will be sent to Sirohi for fact finding and an independent probe into the incident.

In a case underscoring the perils of caring for Ebola patients, a nurse in Spain has contracted the disease — the first time the virus has spread outside West Africa during the current epidemic.
The nurse’s illness illustrates the danger that health care workers face not only in poorly equipped West African clinics, but also in the more sophisticated medical centers of Europe and the United States.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, says health care workers are at the greatest risk in all Ebola outbreaks.
The development came Monday as another American sick with the disease arrived back in the U.S. for treatment and President Barack Obama said the government was considering ordering more careful screening of airline passengers traveling from the outbreak region.

India to top global remittances with $71 billion this year
PTI Oct 7, 2014, 09.03AM IST
("Remittance inflows provided…)
WASHINGTON: India will retain its top spot with USD 71 billion in remittances this year as remittances to developing countries are expected to reach USD 435 billion, an increase of five per cent over 2013, the World Bank has said.
In its latest issue of the Migration and Development Brief, the World Bank said yesterday India, with the world's largest emigrant stock of 14 million people, will remain in the top spot this year, attracting about USD 71 billion in remittances.
"Remittances to developing countries grew this year by five per cent. Remittance inflows provided stable cover for substantial parts of the import bill for such countries as Egypt, Pakistan, Haiti, Honduras, and Nepal," said Kaushik Basu, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank Group.
He said India and China led the chart with "projected remittance inflows of USD 71 and USD 64 billion respectively in 2014."
Other large recipients are China (USD 64 billion), the Philippines (USD 28 billion), Mexico (USD 24 billion), Nigeria (USD 21 billion), Egypt (USD 18 billion), Pakistan (USD 17 billion), Bangladesh (USD 15 billion), Vietnam (USD 11 billion) and Ukraine (USD 9 billion).
The growth rate this year is substantially faster than the 3.4 per cent growth recorded in 2013, driven largely by remittances to Asia and Latin America, it said.
Remittances to developing countries will continue climbing in the medium term, reaching an estimated USD 454 billion in 2015. Global remittances, including those to high-income countries, are estimated at USD 582 billion this year, rising to USD 608 billion next year, it said.
The Bank said remittances to the South Asia region are increasing more robustly this year, accelerating from slower growth in 2013. Although flows to India, the region's largest remittance recipient, will grow modestly by 1.5 per cent in 2014.
The expansion is being led by flows from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, where skilled and unskilled workers are finding renewed job opportunities.
As a result, the growth rate of remittances to the region is expected to more than double this year to 5.5 per cent (from 2.7 per cent in 2013), boosting volumes to USD 117 billion in 2014 and rising further to USD 123 billion in 2015, it said.
"In addition, India and the Philippines benefit from having migrants with the most diverse destination spread, thereby creating buffers against regional shocks. Given the growing importance of this sector, the World Bank's Migration and Development Brief has become an essential tool for global development policy experts," Basu said.
The brief notes that the global average cost of sending remittances continued its downward trend in the third quarter of 2014, falling to 7.9 per cent of the value sent, compared to 8.9 per cent a year earlier. However, the cost of sending money to Africa remains stubbornly high, exceeding 11 per cent.
As a share of GDP (2013), the top recipients of remittances were Tajikistan (42 per cent), Kyrgyz Republic (32 per cent), Nepal (29 per cent), Moldova (25 per cent), Lesotho and Samoa (24 per cent each), Armenia and Haiti (both 21 per cent), the Gambia (20 per cent) and Liberia (18 per cent).
It said the forced migration due to conflict was at its highest level since World War II, affecting more than 51 million people.
An additional 22 million people have been forced to move due to natural disasters, bringing the total affected by forced migration to at least 73 million, according to the latest available data.
"Despite the encouraging outlook for remittance flows, the circumstances of many migrants are troubling," said Dilip Ratha, Lead Economist, Migration and Remittances, at the World Bank's Development Prospects Group and Head of the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD).
"With so many people on the move against their will and many others undertaking desperate and dangerous journeys, it is clear that more effort is needed to make migration safer and cheaper by exploring economically viable policy options," he said.

Flop or not, Flipkart flash sale to widen ecommerce mkt
The negative aspects notwithstanding, there are several reasons why the flash sale was good for Flipkart and for the ecommerce industry as a whole.
Post your opinion here
 
Moneycontrol Bureau
The jury is still out on whether homegrown online retail giant Flipkart’s grand ‘Big Billion Day’ was a success or not.
Launched as a mega online flash sale where the website was giving away products at discounts of up to 90 percent, the website hit a slew of bad news as its servers crashed , orders got cancelled and in many cases products went out of stock within minutes. (Even though this did not stop the website from reporting a stupendous single-day sale of about USD 100 million, or slightly less than a tenth of its total yearly sales tally.)
Flipkart rivals such as Snapdeal and Amazon also tried to steal a march over it by launching their own flash sales, with the former claiming to have notched up sales of about an equal value.
The news got worse with several offline retailers complaining to the commerce minister asking for the ecommerce business to be regulated, in a communication that apparently conveys that the government may be asked to look into predatory pricing practices by online retailers.
Then there are questions on whether such as a strategy can be sustainable – reports suggest a bulk of the bill for discounts offered by Flipkart will be footed by itself rather than its vendor partners. This could further stress the cash position of the retailer that is reportedly burning cash through and not reporting any profits even as sales have been going through the roof.
The negative aspects notwithstanding, there are several reasons why the flash sale was good for Flipkart and for the ecommerce industry as a whole.
One, a sale of such magnitude helps deepen the ecommerce market by getting in converts to the online fold. So even as online sales have increased at a phenomenal pace (figures suggest it has increased from USD 2.5 billion in 2009 to about USD 13 billion in 2013), it is still a fraction of the USD 500 billion plus offline retail market .
Also, a bulk of the online sales figure comes from travel-booking websites, which cater to a very niche market, meaning the actual online retail market in India is much too small. This means that much of the rise-of-the-ecommerce story is, while being impressive, overstated.
The reasons are clear: India’s Internet penetration is low (about 15 percent compared to about 50 percent for China). While Flipkart reportedly notched up sales of over USD 1 billion last year, it hardly compares to Chinese online giant Alibaba, which ratcheted up sales of USD 248 billion .
As a result, every push by companies such as Flipkart or its rivals will help broaden the retail base and create a sort of cult around such events. In the US, the luster of the practice of the years-old Black Friday sales for offline retailers (on the Friday following Thanksgiving) has already been dimmed by the rivaling Cyber Monday launched by online firms (and which takes place on the Monday immediate following Black Friday).
Two, the criticism about whether Flipkart spread itself too thin by launching a sale of a magnitude it could not handle technologically is well-founded but having learnt its lesson, the website would do well next year around to prepare for such exigencies as server crashes, etc.
The offline flash by Future Group’s Big Bazaar, which started its annual Maha Bachat sale a few years back on the occasion of Independence Day also saw glitches such as unending customer queues but over the years, the company has learnt to manage the event more smoothly without harming its reputation.
Three, Flipkart’s mega flash sale also fits well within its strategy of coming out ahead in terms of sales even at the cost of profits.
For, the ecommerce market has worldwide exhibited signs of a winner-take-all dynamics where the industry leaders corner a bulk of the market after achieving scale and muscle out the smaller players.
Thus, in the wake of increasing competition in the online selling space, it becomes imperative for the leader to continue to try to proactively protect and increase its market share, till such time the market evolves and starts to consolidate.

Ahead of Jayalalithaa s bail plea hearing  protests abound in Tamil NaduAnti-Kannadiga posters dot Chennai ahead of Jayalalithaa's bail plea hearing
BS Reporter | Chennai Oct 07, 2014 12:29 PM IST
As the Karnataka High Court decides today whether AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa deserves bail in the 18-year-old disproportionate assets case, a series of xenophobic posters warning Karnataka have been erected across Chennai.
The most disturbing ones even threatened to hold Kannadigas living in the state hostage if Jayalalithaa is not released.
 
The posters carried the names of Trichy Member of Parliament P Kumar, state minister B Valarmathy, and state Assembly member V P Kalairajan. None of them were available for comment to verify whether the posters were placed by them. 
 
The caption in other posters said 'Can a mortal punish god', which was countered by an anti-AIADMK group on Facebook saying "Can God be at the mercy of a human being for bail?”
 
Another poster warned Karnataka: "Beware dry leaves! You have kept fire in jail. If you free her today, she will be the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. If her detention is prolonged, she will also become the Chief Minister of Karnataka."
 
“You keep Cauvery [waters] with you. Give me Amma,” one poster said, with the image of a crying baby alongside a picture of Jayalalithaa, suggesting a child asking for its mother. 
The Bangalore Commissioner of Police has spoken to his Chennai counterpart expressing concern over the anti-Kannadiga posters. The Chennai police chief has reportedly said that there is no danger to Kannadigas in the city and that the posters will be removed and action taken against the sponsors. 
 
Meanshile, anxiety and tension prevailed among AIADMK cadre, who are putting up road blocks, organising dharnas, fasting, and conducting poojas for their leader's release.
 
Meanwhile, private schools in Tamil Nadu have withdrawn their scheduled one day strike today seeking the release of the former chief minister who was jailed late last month on corruption charges. Earlier, about 12,000 schools in the state decided to close today, triggering angry reactions from parents as well as politicians.
 
School administrators have said they are participating in a hunger strike in Chennai today. 
 
One of the biggest vegetables, fruits and flowers markets in Asia – the Chennai Koyambedu market -- stayed closed today demanding the release of Jayalaithaa. About 4,000 shops were shut while 8,000 employees participated in a hunger strike. Residents of Madurai were also deprived of their daily quota of vegetables as the market remained closed. 
 
A few AIADMK party workers decided to undertake a 350km 'spiritual journey' by walking from Chennai to Parapana Agrahara central prison, where Jayalalithaa and the other three convicted in the wealth case are lodged. 
 
AIADMK cadres continued to stage demonstrations to convey their angst in various parts of the Southern Tamil Nadu. In Coimbatore, representatives of 22 government employee associations staged a hunger strike at Gandhipuram. Former MPs and MLAs participated in the protest. 
 
Tension and protest continues to prevail in the Tamil Nadu–Karnataka border town of Hosur.
 
In Tuticorin, AIADMK fishermen protested in mid-sea. They threw the effigy of Subramanian Swamy, who initiated the case against Jayalalithaa, into the sea and hanged the effigy of DMK Supermo M Karunanidhi from a boat. Fishermen in Rameswaram and Pamban went on an indefinite strike and in the hill station of Kodaikanal, shops and establishments were closed which affected, according to reports.
 
In Bangalore, anticipating a large presence of AIADMK cadre, the city police has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 in a one kilometre radius around the Karnataka High Court and around the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison.
 
Reports quoting Bangalore Police Commissioner M N Reddi said that security had been tightened and over 2,000 personnel led by a Joint Commissioner would be deployed at both places. 
 

Latest SmokeHouse Deli restaurant is not so hotStory
Not so hot
Given that this space is supposed to be a reinvented SmokeHouse Deli, you keep looking for the newness and come away disappointed.
Prachi Bhuchar        Edition: Sep 14, 2014
Coronation Chicken Salad
You walk into a deli thinking of fresh produce, simple flavours and a fuss-free meal. The SmokeHouse Deli has always ticked the boxes when it comes to these parameters, but their latest restaurant, at the DLF Place mall Saket, seems a bit off-kilter.
Maybe the chef was having a bad day or maybe they don't really care too much because they are already an established brand, but we left with a sense that they just haven't taken care with either taste or appearance of dishes.
The concept behind the new restaurant is quaint; it is modeled on an English tea house and floral motifs are scattered across the space; the furniture is all wrought iron and you can imagine being in a smart tea house, but not just yet, since they don't have an exclusive tea time menu to do justice to the theme.
Given that this space is supposed to be a reinvented SmokeHouse Deli, you keep looking for the newness and come away disappointed.
To be fair, the decor is different (to an extent) and there are more vegetarian options on the menu than before, but that aside, the menu is quite dull and predictable.
I began with the assorted seafood fritters which were average. The batter was thick and the hero of the dish, the seafood , was not showcased.
The smoked chicken, caperberries salad with an orange vodka dressing had wilted lettuce and way too much dressing. I have eaten at their other branches several times in the past and have never dealt with poorly constructed salads so this was quite unexpected. The redeeming dish on the menu was the pumpkin broth with seafood and coconut and the grilled steak which was cooked to perfection. I ended my meal with the Philly and plum cheesecake which was strong on flavor and had a creamy texture, but the rest of the meal was sadly below par.
The portions at SmokeHouse Deli are generous with a view to promoting community-style eating and the staff was quite courteous, but it was the food that disappointed.
Also, given that it is constructed in a rather al fresco manner, you almost feel as though you are eating in a food court with shoppers peering in as they walk across the busy mall.
Mango and Ginger Margarita
Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes, maybe not, but the new SmokeHouse Deli left a lot to be desired. Once they have ironed out the initial chinks it might be worth going back to, even if just to sample their new tea menu and the British tea house ambience. Till then, I would rather visit one of their other outlets where I can be assured of quality and the taste of dishes.

Pumpkin broth with seafood and coconut
Philly and plum cheesecake

Tension mounts as rival Koreas exchange warningshotsPrint

Associated Press | Seoul | Posted: October 7, 2014 11:58 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:01 pm
Warships from the rival Koreas exchanged warning shots Tuesday after a North Korean ship briefly violated the disputed western sea boundary, a South Korean defense official said.
The shots were fired into the sea and there have been no reports of injuries and damage to the ships of either side, the official said on condition of anonymity, citing office policy.
Such exchanges are not uncommon at the sea boundary, the scene of several deadly maritime skirmishes between the Koreas in recent years. But the latest incident happened three days after a group of high-profile North Korean officials made a surprise visit to South Korea and agreed to resume senior-level talks.
South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Monday stressed the need to hold high-level talks on a regular basis, saying she hopes North Korea would show how sincere it is about improving ties.
The South Korean official said the North Korean ship was in South Korea-controlled waters for about 10 minutes before it retreated to its waters. He said a South Korea navy ship first broadcast a warning and then fired warning shots before the North Korean ship fired back at waters near the South Korean ship. The South Korean ship returned fire into the sea near the North Korean ship, the official said.
North Korean navy ships and fishing boats frequently violate the boundary drawn by the American-led U.N. command at the end of the Korean War in the early 1950s without the North’s consent. The line cuts North Korea off from rich fishing waters.
The Korean Peninsula remains at a technical state of war because the Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

Associated Press | Washington | Posted: October 7, 2014 10:56 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:16 pm
The Pentagon has spent as much as $1.1 billion on U.S. military operations against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria since the mission began in mid-June, including more than $62 million alone in Navy airstrikes and Tomahawk cruise missiles.

U.S. Central Command, in data released Monday, said that the Navy has dropped roughly 185 munitions, including 47 cruise missiles launched from ships in the region. Central Command said Air Force fighter jets have far exceeded those numbers, launching close to 1,000 munitions. The data released Monday broke out the $62 million spent on Navy munitions, but provided no cost estimates for Air Force munitions.

The bulk of the Navy costs were for the 47 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired by American warships in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea that targeted the Khorasan Group, an al-Qaida cell, in eight locations west of the city of Aleppo in Syria. The group was said to be plotting imminent attacks on American and Western interests, and it was one of the key targets two weeks ago when the U.S. first began airstrikes into Syria.

Big break: Hewlett-Packard to split into two public companiesHP Increases Layoffs AGAIN To 55,000, And More Cuts Are Likely
Some analysts expressed skepticism about the latest move.
Barclays analysts noted that the sudden announcement in 2011 was disruptive to HP's sales, its sales force and demand.
"If the (latest) decision by HP isn't well communicated or is not well executed, the negative share shifts could be material," they said in a note.
Analysts at Bernstein Research also warned of "material negative synergies" and one-time costs associated with the spinoff, largely in purchasing but also in distribution. The separation, they said, was fueled by weakness, not strength.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with Whitman.
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
While there were skeptics, many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of HP or a sale of the PC business so that HP could focus on the more profitable side of its operations.
"Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates," Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP.
HP is the latest in a line of companies to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
"We like the spin and believe it could create additional value over time," UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, wrote. "In our view, focus is more important than synergies, and it is hard to be good at both consumer and enterprise computing."
HP's printing and PC business will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co served as financial adviser to HP. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz was legal adviser.

Software giant Google plans to launch a mobile messaging app it is likely to test in India and other emerging markets, the Economic Times newspaper reported on Friday, citing sources.
The daily said Google was in the early stages of development of the app, which will not make it mandatory to use a Google login.
If launched, the mobile app will compete in the mobile chat space with the likes of WhatsApp , Line and Hike.
The Mountain View, California-based company is also looking at localisation, by adding Indian language support and voice-to-text messaging, the newspaper said.
A Google spokeswoman said the company did not comment on speculation.
 

Pre-booking for iPhone 6 series to start in India from October 7Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Mobile phone distributor Ingram Micro Monday said that it will offer the much-awaited iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices in India from 12.01 AM on October 17, with pre-orders to start at the same time on October 7.
The devices will be available at all leading modern trade stores and retail outlets across India, the company said in a statement. It however didn't give details of the price.
Apple's new devices are expected to corner a chunk of the premium market when they are introduced in India on the back of pent up aspirational demand. The brand's iconic status — besides features such as a larger, crisper screen, faster processor, better camera and onboard storage of as much as 128 GB — will continue to draw consumers, experts expect.
They add that of the two, the iPhone 6 Plus with a 5.5-inch display could fare better, given the demand for handsets with larger screen sizes.
The strong demand in India for the devices is borne out by prices in the grey market. On eBay India, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were available for between Rs 57,990 and Rs 1.29 lakh, based on the model and internal memory.
In grey markets such as Mumbai's Heera Panna shopping complex and Kolkata's AC Market and Fancy Market, the 16GB variant of the iPhone 6 was the most commonly available model at around Rs 60,000-62,000.
Apple recently announced that it had sold more than 10 million units of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models in just three days after the launch on September 19 in 10 markets, setting a new record for the company. It further announced the availability of the new iPhones in 20 additional countries and said the devices will be launched in 115 countries by the end of the year.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said last week that while the company has managed the manufacturing ramp-up better than ever before with the new iPhones, it could have sold many more if supply was better and is working hard to fill orders as quickly as possible.

Now  a UK  US like committee to fix interest ratesGovernment in talks with RBI on panel to set monetary policy with an inflation focus
Deepshikha Sikarwar, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 07.30AM IST
(The agreement, as suggested,…)
NEW DELHI: India is embarking on steps that will lead to the government agreeing to inflation targeting while monetary policy will be decided by a committee, in line with systems in the US and the UK, and marking the start of sweeping changes in the financial sector.
The finance ministry has begun discussions with the Reserve Bank of India on an agreement to put in place the framework that's needed along the lines of high-level panels such as the Urjit Patel committee and the BN Srikrishna-headed Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission.
The agreement will lead to creation of a committee to set monetary policy that will be geared to an inflation target. The contours of this plan will be made public so views can be sought before an accord is signed.
FSLRC suggested five-member panel
"Discussions are on with the RBI," said a finance ministry official, adding that the government is keen to have the framework in place soon.
The government had made its intentions clear in the July 10 budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley. "It is... essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy," Jaitley had said. "The government will, in close consultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework." The FSLRC had suggested setting up a fivemember monetary policy committee headed by the governor.
RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has said previously that Parliament should set the inflation target and the central bank should be mandated to achieve this.
Having a committee system in place would mark a radical shift in the way monetary policy is decided in the country. Currently, the governor is the sole authority to decide policy and the RBI board only has an advisory role. Following the change, policy will be decided by the proposed committee chaired by the governor through a vote.
The agreement is being proposed in the interim pending legislative changes on the lines of the 1997 deal between the RBI and the government to end the issuance of ad hoc treasury bills to finance budget deficits and replace that with the scheme of ways and means advances. Incidentally, the RBI has adopted inflation targeting as a basis of its monetary policy.
The consultations follow criticism of some FSLRC recommendations by Rajan and experts say it will be interesting to see what tack the central bank adopts in these early talks. The framework is being designed on the model followed in countries such as the US and the UK. In the latter, the treasury sets the remit of the monetary policy in discussion with the central bank, while decisions on policy are taken by a committee.
The proposed framework draws from the work of a number of expert committees on financial sector reforms including the highpowered expert committee on making Mumbai an international financial centre (IFC) and the Rajan panel on financial sector reforms, besides the Patel panel and the FSLRC. The new framework agreement would come into effect from a date decided by the RBI, the official said.
The Patel committee to revise and strengthen the monetary policy framework mooted a shift to the Consumer Price Index as the nominal anchor for inflation targeting and the setting up of a monetary policy committee headed by the governor with rate action decided by votes, the model followed by the US Federal Reserve. The FSLRC has recommended that price stability is a desirable goal in its own right, particularly in India, where inflation is known to hurt the poor and therefore the central bank must be given a quantitative objective that can be monitored by the central government for its monetary policy function.
The Rajan panel had said the RBI can best serve the cause of growth by focusing on controlling inflation, and intervening in currency markets only to limit excessive volatility. This focus can also best serve the cause of inclusion because the poorer sections are least hedged against inflation.
The RBI should formally have a single objective to stay close to a low inflation number, or within a range in the medium term, and move steadily to a single instrument, the short-term interest rate (the repo and reverse repo) to achieve this. The Mumbai IFC panel had said the gold standard for a monetary policy framework was a transparent, independent, inflation-targeting central bank.
Experts said the move marks a significant step in the direction of financial sector reforms. "This is a move towards modernising the monetary policy," said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. "It would bring more clarity in the policy."

Arsenal vs Manchester United – A dying rivalry?
Is the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United one that's dying out? …
Washington, Oct 6 (IANS) Narendra Modi was dressed for the occasion wherever he went, but the diverse colours that the Indian prime minister donned on his recent US visit had one unifying theme - to win America. And this is being talked about even a week after his visit.
And win America he did even before he reached Washington for a much awaited summit with President Barack Obama after wowing the Indian diaspora, sharing the stage with top American music stars to reach out to America's liberal youth and wooing the big business in the Big Apple.
It was a surprise performance from a once provincial leader with little foreign policy experience who came to power just four months ago though with a historic win in Indian elections giving his Bharatiya Janata Party a clear mandate for the first time in 30 years.
Landing in America's financial capital in a smart casual maroon bandhgala and black pants, he got out of his car in front of his hotel to shake hands with delighted members of the Indian-American community chanting "Modi Modi" as anxious security guys scrambled to keep their charge safe
Then he switched to a more formal bandhgala suit for meetings with the city's mayor and a Nobel Laureate cancer researcher. That was to be the pattern of Modi's 100-hour action-packed whirlwind tour laced with symbolism.
Next day wearing his trade mark half sleeve Modi kurta and churidars with a grey shawl thrown on his left shoulder, he paid homage at Ground Zero where the twin towers of the World Trade Centre stood before the 9/11 attack, to show India's resolve to fight terrorism and solidarity with Americans.
Switching to a formal blue bandhgala suit, Modi then took to the world stage with an address to the UN General Assembly choosing to speak in India's national language, Hindi.
And instead of mouthing cliché ridden paeans to non-alignment he gave a call to form a 'G-all' in today's interdependent world. Yet he also chided Pakistan for raking up Kashmir at the UN and offered to engage in a "serious bilateral dialogue", but "without the shadow of terrorism".
In the evening, he outlined his vision of a 'Clean India' to a 65,000-strong youthful crowd at New York's Central Park addressing them in an idiom they understood saying "I salute you" and "May the force be with you" from the evergreen hit Star Wars films.
A capacity crowd of nearly 20,000 star struck Indian-American gave him a rock star like welcome at the Madison Square Garden as he spoke to them in Hindi in his chatty style for over an hour as thousands more heard him on jumbotron screens at Times square and in homes across the US.
Then packing meetings with two governors, including South Carolina's Indian-American Nikki Haley, 40 odd lawmakers, 11 CEOs and an address to the Council on Foreign Relations, again in Hindi, Modi headed to Washington.
An Indian-American writer suggested that Modi through his fast for the Hindu festival of Navratri and the choice of his apparel was speaking in code his "Hindu nationalist" supporters, while another implied that he was cocking a snook to the American establishment that had denied him a visa for nearly a decade.
Be as it may, the US officialdom from President Barack Obama down also treated Modi no less as they broke the ice over an exclusive dinner at the White House. As they shared common experiences, Obama wondered how Modi kept up such a rigorous schedule on just a diet of warm water and yoga and told him how he himself enjoyed dancing during his 2010 trip to India.
So much so that as the summit ended with the two leaders giving a new mantra of "chalein saath saath - together we go forward," Obama joined Modi on an unscheduled trip to the memorial of African-American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
Modi had come full circle in just four short months. There lay the true significance of the Modi visit though some critics dismissed their joint statement vowing to deepen cooperation in from defence to nuclear to space to counter-terrorism to women's empowerment and health as merely a rehashed 'laundry list'.
What Modi himself has called a "hugely successful" and US officials branded as an "extraordinarily successful" journey was different from others before in more ways than just optics: the two sides have lined up a "pretty ambitious agenda of engagement" over the next nine months or so to translate words into action.

Markets will push down rates 0.25%. Will RBI Governor RajanFalling crude oil prices to test Raghuram Rajan's resolve to keep interest rates high

(Oil marketing companies…)
MUMBAI: In less than a week after Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan vowed to keep interest rates high to win the battle against inflation, markets may test his resolve by reducing interest rates on government bonds amid key crude oil prices falling to multi-year lows.
Yields on benchmark government securities may ease 25 basis points or more in the coming months with improving outlook on finances as the government has trimmed its annual borrowing target by Rs 8,000 crore. "The dipping oil prices have given a new reason to the bond market to cheer," said R Sivakumar, head - fixed income, Axis Mutual Fund. "Lower commodity prices will gradually lead to both subsidy reduction and softer inflation. The ten-year benchmark bond yield should be drifting towards 8% from the current level in the next six months."
The fall in crude oil prices, the single-largest item in India's import bill at $450.94 billion last year, could help ease diesel and petrol prices, which could also reduce government's fuel subsidy bill which was at about Rs 94,000 crore in 2013-14, and is pegged at Rs 65,000 crore this fis cal. A combination of the two could even bring inflation down as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
"Import bills are likely to drop by approximately Rs 40,000 crore if Brent crude remains below $95 per barrel," said Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance.
"Investors who are betting on government securities at the current levels are likely to benefit in the next six to 12 months." Brent crude, the global oil price benchmark, last week dipped below $92 a barrel, its lowest since June 2012. This drop was primarily due to weak global economic recovery, oversupply in the market and US dollar strengthening against other major currencies.
With every one dollar fall in crude oil prices, India's import bill drops by about Rs 3,700 crore. "Due to falling oil prices, the government's fuel subsidy bill may come down to around Rs 45,000-50,000 crore this year, a dip of 23-30% from earlier estimates," said Soumya Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India.
Oil marketing companies such as Indian Oil Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp have been reducing retail prices. Petrol prices were cut 54 paise a litre to Rs 67.86 in Delhi and Rs 75.73 in Mumbai, while diesel prices may also be reduced by Rs 2 per litre, according to a media report. Bond investors believe that benchmark yield on government bonds could fall to 8-8.25% from 8.48% at last Friday's close.
But this would be going against the grain of what Rajan wants to achieve. After raising interest rates thrice since September 2013, he has held on to it saying that he would reduce it only when he's convinced that CPI is showing signs of easing to 6% by January 2016.
"With international crude prices softening and relative stability in the foreign exchange market, some upside risks to inflation are receding," Rajan said. "Yet, there are risks from food price shocks as the full effect of the monsoon's passage unfolds, and from geo-political developments that could materialise rapidly," he said, hinting at not slashing rates immediately.
"Turning to the medium-term objective (6% by January 2016) the balance of risks is still to the upside....This continues to warrant policy preparedness to contain pressures if the risks materialise."

Rajan has managed to win across-the-board support for his fight againt inflationOctober 6, 2014, 12:21 am IST Mythili Bhusnurmath in Myth-n-Reality | Business , Economy | ET

The RBI’s monetary policy announcement couldn’t have been more unremarkable. Governor Raghuram Rajan batted as predicted. All policy rates were kept unchanged: repo rate at 8%, cash reserve ratio at 4%, even the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) that the central bank had been tinkering with earlier was left untouched at 22%.
So, the surprise was not in the RBI’s policy statement, nor in the market reaction: the Sensex closed almost flat. The surprise is in the unexpected allies who have rallied round to the governor’s cause.
In the past, business chambers used to be raucous in their call to cut interest rates. They were equally vociferous in their criticism when the central bank failed to oblige. But this time around, there was not even a whimper in the run-up to the policy announcement. Even better, when despite lower inflation, Rajan signalled that the governor, much like Margaret Thatcher, was ‘not for turning’, industry supported him.
Second Thoughts
Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and till recently sternly critical of RBI’s ‘fixation’ on inflation, is only one of many unexpected cheerleaders. “The RBI’s decision to maintain status quo on policy rates is not fully unexpected as in the growth-inflation dilemma, the concern is to guard against the anticipation of upside risks emerging from inflationary expectations,” the CII stated.
The support came even though in CII’s perception, “this could have been a good opportunity for the RBI to reduce rates since macros have improved and the onset of the festive season is also likely to spur demand for consumer goods”. But in a marked softening of its earlier opposition, it added that it “does appreciate the RBI’s view that inflation needs to be dealt with once and for all”.
I Love Expensive Stuff
Contrast this with what the CII had to say in January when the RBI raised interest rates a mere 25 basis points. In a scathing criticism, the CII denounced the hike saying, “The easing of inflation at a time when industrial growth continues to be in the red should induce RBI to review its monetary policy stance and cut its policy rates to rejuvenate growth, which has been hit by high interest costs, flagging investments and subdued demand.”
In April, while commenting on the February data on industrial production, the CII doggedly stuck to its call for lower interest rates. Urging the RBI not to wait till the next review, it called on the central bank to “take note of the alarming industrial growth situation and start on an easing cycle on the interest rate front” without waiting for the next monetary policy review. The irony is the macro picture at the ground level today is not very different. Inflation, though still high, is trending lower while growth is yet to pick up.
By the RBI’s own reckoning, it is on course to achieve not only the near-term goal of 8% inflation by January 2015, but, with some caveats, the more distant goal of 6% by 2016 too. However, growth is not expected to pick up till the fourth quarter of this fiscal. A conundrum that would normally have had industry associations shouting from the rooftops for a rate cut.
Yet, when the governor dug his heels in and opted not to cut rates, industry seems sympathetic. This despite the governor having made it clear that “the future policy stance will be influenced by the Reserve Bank’s projections of inflation relative to the medium-term objective (6% by January 2016) while being contingent on incoming data”. In English, that means: forget a rate cut. I don’t rule out a rate hike!
Sleeping with the Enemy
However, industry is strangely quiescent. The CII is not the only newfound ally. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) was more guarded in its comments, saying the “governor had made the RBI’s position clear” earlier and the policy is on expected lines.
So what explains this newfound sympathy from erstwhile diehard critics? Part of the reason is that finance minister Arun Jaitley seems less willing to lend his ear to industry’s complaints about interest rates.
If at all he shares industry’s view on interest rates, he has kept his counsel, quite unlike his predecessor P Chidambaram, who was forever urging the RBI to cut rates. Industry, always quick to recognise which way the wind is blowing, knows its pleas will cut no ice with the FM.
Hence its decision to switch sides. If you can’t beat them, join them. But no less important is Rajan’s remarkable success in communicating his determination to fight inflation. He has used every occasion to reiterate the RBI’s commitment to its inflation glide path. If he has any reservations about the central bank’s ability on that score, he, too, has kept his counsel.
On all counts, Narendra Modi’s success in selling the India story has been matched by Rajan’s success in selling his inflation warrior story. The danger is both could unravel quite quickly if reality does not keep pace with expectations. And here, Rajan is on a much weaker wicket than Modi.

5 things to remember when buying a luxury property
Sanjay Kumar Singh, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 08.00AM IST

housing
(Some of the criteria to should…)
Shambhu Kumar, 42, a London-based IT professional, is keen to buy a luxury property in Gurgaon, Bangalore or Pune. Since the amount of money at stake is high, Kumar is keen to learn about the factors to which he should give primacy in his search.
Location, location, location
Contrary to popular perception, experts suggest that more than the bells and whistles—the amenities and specifications—you should give primacy to location when hunting for a luxury property. As the adjacent table shows, the market for luxury apartments thrives in plush locations. "Often developers develop super-premium apartments at peripheral locations. Even though they provide very high-end facilities, the project fails to command the pricing demanded because the location is unattractive," says AS Sivaramakrishnan, head of residential services, CBRE South Asia.
"The location should inherently command the kind of premium pricing being asked for," emphasises Shweta Jain, executive directorresidential services, Cushman & Wakefield . Any project that is located in a peripheral area or in areas that lack social infrastructure should not make the cut.
Space-lots of it
The second criterion that defines luxury is space. An apartment that is branded as luxury should be of above 3,500 sq. ft. In the NCR , depending on the location, the FAR (floor area ratio) norms allow anywhere between 1,000 and 1,500 apartments to be constructed over 10 acres. For a project to be classified as luxury, the number of dwelling units should be much lower and there should be lots of open space.
Top-end amenities
Only after getting the first two parameters right should you turn your attention to this one. Today, of course, the sky is the limit on this parameter. Top-notch security features, imported flooring materials, high-end kitchen and bathroom fittings—there is no end to what the globally travelled customer demands and gets. "In the ideal scenario, the developer should create the basic framework and allow the customer to choose the specifications he wants," suggests Sivaramakrishnan.
The right developer
The developer should ideally be someone who has delivered luxury properties in the past. "Developers who lack experience of developing luxury properties may find it difficult to deliver the kind of end-toend experience that today's topbracket buyers expect," says Jain. Operating in the luxury segment calls for the developer to be highly customer oriented. That's where the inexperienced player may be found wanting.
If a project comes up to the mark on these criteria, you should then do the basic due diligence: whether the developer has the land title, if his financial position is sound, and all permissions are in place.
What should you avoid?
In India, very tall projects with 70-80 floors or more automatically gets classified as luxury. This should not be so. "Ask what value such a building brings to your lifestyle," says Jain. Another ploy to attract deep-pocketed customers is to tie up with the world's leading luxury brands, or with developers of the world's well-known luxury projects. Often these tie-ups are purely cosmetic. Again, the buyer should cast a discerning eye and ask: what value does that brand bring to the table?

Rishad to join Wipro board with CFO Senapaty set to retireWipro founder Azim Premji's son Rishad Premji to join board as CFO Suresh Senapaty retires next year

(Senapaty’s retirement…)
BANGALORE: India's third-biggest software exporter Wipro is preparing for a generational shift at the top after company veteran and CFO Suresh Senapaty retires next March. Rishad Premji , the elder son of Wipro's billionaire founder Azim Premji , and also the company's head of strategy, is set to join the board "sometime next year", at least two people familiar with the discussions said.
"It's not that he (Rishad) was not part of the board discussions — he's always been since becoming the CSO —but with formal induction, he will get closer to representing ownership on the board," the first person said. There are two triggers for Rishad's promotion to the board. Firstly, Suresh Senapaty's retirement leaves an executive leadership post to be filled, and secondly, Rishad's grooming over the past seven years in different roles in the company seems to have almost achieved the purpose. "In some sense, this is a generational shift," the second person said. "It's easily among the best managed family transitions that I have seen in India."
When contacted, a Wipro spokesperson asked not to speculate about board appointments.
Rishad Joined Wipro in 2007
"You may be aware that Wipro has a board of directors with a majority of them being independent. The board has various subcommittees, one of them being Nomination and Governance consisting of independent directors and chaired by Dr Ganguly," the spokesperson said.
"Matters relating to any change in board members including new appointments are subject matters dealt with by such committee before it is deliberated by the board for a final decision (of course, subject to shareholder approval)," the Wipro spokesperson added.
Experts said it makes sense for Premji to have his son represent the family while he is still on the board to ensure the transition. "The transition of leadership in a family enterprise is a challenging period for all stakeholders," said Mike Fassler, consultant at Family Business Consulting Group in Chicago, which helps wealthy families sort through conflicts.
Fassler said senior Premji's presence on board will help "bring comfort to all stakeholders" even as Rishad takes the next step to join the board. "Effecting the transition while the leading generation is still available to influence the next generation's development can be an incredibly powerful demonstration of the family's commitment to and influence on the continuity of the enterprise," said Fassler. When Rishad joins the board of Wipro, he will continue to retain his current position as head of strategy, according to a third executive familiar with the development.
"He is to head the corporate venture arm," said the executive. "Corporate venture arm is nothing but identifying and evaluating startups which Wipro will back. So he will continue to be head of strategy even when he is on the board." Wipro is currently in the midst of putting together a team of executives that will oversee the $100-million corporate venture arm, to be spearheaded by Rishad.
Premji junior joined Wipro in 2007, working in capital markets space under banking and financial services division at Wipro. Less than a year after joining the company, he was overseeing the integration of USbased Gallagher with Wipro, when the company bought the mortgage solutions provider in 2008.
"For six months, he (Rishad) worked on this integration," said one of the executives who worked with Rishad then. "For two months he worked out of Miami office and the rest of time while in India he used to work at graveyard hours shift, always on the phone, trying to answer questions from Gallagher employees and help integrate the company," said the executive. Later in 2010, Rishad was appointed head of strategy.
"One of the things which he (Rishad) has done since taking over his role is to institutionalise this role of M&A in each of the six service lines," said two executives. By institutionalising, the executives mean that Rishad has helped each of the six services lines at Wipro have an executive focused on acquiring companies that can help Wipro scale up business. "Each of the service lines sees the opportunities and shares it with the central team," said the executive. In the last four years as head of strategy, Rishad has also got a lot of executives with domain experience in each of the six service lines.
"So until now, say healthcare unit had a lot of software engineers," said one executive. "Now we have a lot of executives who have experience working with pharma companies, who understand the business. They are able to work closely with the team and tell them exactly what the client wants." This, the executives claim, is one of the reasons why Wipro has started winning more transformational deals. A point validated by Ayan Mukerji, head of telecoms and media business of Wipro, who in an interview to ET last month said the company's winnability rate in media and telecoms space has jumped fourfold in the past two years.
Nonetheless, Fassler believes that "next generation family enterprise leaders face some common challenges which include continuing to develop family commitment to the future of the enterprise, balancing reinvestment of capital for the future with current period dividends to shareholders, and development of their own leadership identity while honoring the past."

You are a diligent saver, a careful investor and a meticulous planner. Yet, you have not been able to build wealth even as everyone around you seems to be wallowing in money. What's stopping you from getting rich? If it's bad luck, you can buy one of those good fortune charms hawked on late night TV shows. But if you really want to get to the root of the problem, you need to assess where you are going wrong in your investments.
Our cover story this week is about the money myths and investing flaws that prevent you from getting rich. It could be the lure of penny stocks or the tantalising potential of the futures and options segment. Small investors often lose their shirts (and nearly everything else) when they enter these high-risk arenas without adequate knowledge.
But mistakes can happen even if you play ultra safe. If a fixed deposit offers 9%, the post-tax returns for someone in the 30% tax bracket will be barely 6.3%. That's not too bad until you factor in 8% inflation. So even though the investor does not feel it, his money is losing value. This is one of the biggest investing mistakes Indians make when they pour money into fixed deposits. In the following pages, we have listed the common hurdles that prevent investors from getting rich.
Many of these hurdles are really self made. They can be done away with by changing your approach to investing. Gold, for instance, should not occupy more than 5-10% allocation in your portfolio. This can happen if you treat the yellow metal less as an investment and more as a hedging tool.
There's no point in dwelling on mistakes unless we can offer a solution. So, each financial mistake has been followed by advice on how to avoid it. This stress on utility has been ET Wealth's hallmark since the time it was launched. In this 200th issue of the newspaper, we hope to live up to the expectations of our readers.
You might be losing your money in the following ways:

Modi attacks Hooda over Vadra-DLF land dealPrint
Hisar: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday urged the Election Commission to take "appropriate action" over the Haryana government's approval of a controversial land deal between Congress president Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra and realty giant DLF.
Modi said it was for the poll panel to take cognizance and "appropriate action" in this matter since the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government had violated the model code of conduct by granting the approval ahead of the Oct 15 assembly elections.
"It looks as if the 'danda' (pressure) has come from the top. The Election Commission should take cognizance and appropriate action in this regard," Modi told a BJP election rally in this Haryana town.
"This action shows that Hooda and the Congress have accepted defeat in the forthcoming polls and are trying to approve such matters," he said.
The Rs.58-crore land deal between Vadra's company and DLF was cancelled in October 2012 by Ashok Khemka, a senior IAS officer in Haryana.
Ridiculing the Congress, Modi said: "The Congress should be ashamed. It has not given an account of its 60 years of sins while in the government. But they are questioning my government after just 60 days."

Corporate Deals Set to Return to Pre-crisis LevelsRegulators Fine Global Banks $3.4 Billion in Forex Probe
London: After a year that's been awash with multi-billion dollar deals, the number and value of mergers and acquisitions looks set to return to pre-crisis levels over the coming 12 months, consulting firm EY said Monday.
In its biannual Global Capital confidence barometer, EY said global M&A is on course to return to 2006 levels in the next year thanks to improvements in market conditions. Companies started getting reluctant to do deals in 2007 when the credit crunch really started. The following year's global financial crisis and subsequent recession saw M&A activity come to a near standstill.
However, the appetite for deal-making has picked up over the past couple of years as the world economy has recovered and stock markets, particularly in the US, have bounced back on growing confidence about the future. This year has seen a flurry of big announcements, particularly in the US, including AT&T's $48.5 billion takeover offer for DirecTV and Facebook's $19 billion bid for WhatsApp.
EY's survey found that 40 per cent of companies anticipate pursuing acquisitions in the next 12 months. That's the highest level in three years.
It said the deals will not be confined to big names. In fact, some of the biggest activity will likely come from smaller firms seeking to strengthen their core businesses - it expects a big pick-up in deals valued at $250 million and under.
"Stable asset prices as well as increasing confidence in stability of the global economy are encouraging a more buoyant outlook for M&A," said Pip McCrostie, EY's global head of M&A. "Having experienced many years of volatility, this growing stability provides greater certainty in terms of strategic planning, although executives will continue to closely monitor unfolding geopolitical events."
EY said much of the M&A momentum will come from companies in the US, Britain, China, Japan, India and Australia. And the top five target countries are Brazil, China, India, Britain and the US. The sectors it found that could see big activity include automotive, technology, life sciences, telecommunications and consumer products
The survey is based on interviews with more than 1,600 senior executives in over 60 countries.

Subrata Roy, the jailed founder and chairman of Sahara Group, has sought immediate restoration of all the facilities, including the use of phone, internet and video-conferencing in an air-conditioned office in the Tihar prison to complete negotiations for sale of his luxury hotels abroad.
In a letter to Tihar authorities, Roy said 80 per cent of the negotiations were over to sell his hotels in London and New York and withdrawal of the facilities on September 30 may result in lapse of the deal.
Roy has also sought special security, saying he faces threat inside the prison premises.
On October 1, the Sahara chief was sent back to his cell in Tihar at the end of the period granted by the Supreme Court for stay at the air-conditioned facility in the complex to negotiate sale of his overseas hotels.
"Subrata Roy in a letter has requested continuation of special services provided to him. He has been sent back to the cell on October 1 as the period granted by the Supreme Court to stay in the air-conditioned facility ended," senior jail officials told PTI.
They said the facility can be further extended only after directions from the Supreme Court.

RBI may raise rates to contain inflation: IMF paperRBI may raise interest rates to contain inflation, says IMF paper
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 18:08 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may consider raising interest rates to bring down the persistently high inflation on a durable basis, suggested an International Monetary Fund (IMF) working paper.
"Given elevated and persistent inflation... The RBI may also need to raise rates to tackle inflation durably, particularly if faced with a persistent and sizable supply-side food price shock putting pressure on broad-based inflation," said the paper titled - 'Food inflation in India: The role for monetary policy'.
Food and fuel inflation in the country has remained high for several years, the paper said adding to durably reduce the current high inflation, the monetary policy stance needs to remain tight for a considerable length of time.
It suggested that the government should pursue structural reforms to push growth to potential levels instead of relying fully on monetary policy to promote growth.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has been pursuing a hawkish monetary policy stance to keep inflation under check. It has not reduced rates in four consecutive policies despite pressure from the industry and the Finance Ministry to cut rates in order to boost growth.
The government is in touch with the central bank to setup a new structure to deal with monetary policy issues, including targeting of inflation, in line with the recommendations of the Urjit Patel committee.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his Budget speech on July 10, "It is also essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy. Government will, in close consultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework."
The Committee had suggested that the RBI should target to bring down retail inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016.
"At the current juncture, with food inflation remaining persistently high for five years, monetary policy needs to remain tight to control generalised inflation," the paper said.
The wholesale price (WPI-based) inflation dropped to a 5-year low of 3.74 per cent in August , while the retail inflation stood at 7.8 per cent.
The IMF paper said since inflation is mostly backward looking, monetary policy has to maintain a tight stance for a prolonged period of time.

Dipak C Jain sees niche specialisations emerging in business managementE Kumar Sharma      Follow @EKumarSharma    Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 19:12 IST
Dipak C. Jain, marketing guru and former dean of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management
Dipak C. Jain, marketing guru and former dean of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and INSEAD, the leading B-school in France, sees niche specialisations emerging in business management . He foresees growth for every sector where there is "human touch" because "human touch cannot be outsourced."
Currently the director of Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration in Bangkok, Thailand, he spoke to Business Today over phone on what is engaging his attention at the moment. He says, "the competitive pressure is so huge today that in my research I see that you don't have the luxury to wait to launch a new product because things like buyer behaviour for instance are changing all the time. Therefore companies need to be proactive rather than reactive." What this means, he says, is that companies need to be constantly innovating and focusing on the service component. "Products can very soon become like commodities with many making similar offerings. So how you create differentiation becomes important and here I think service is going to play a crucial role."
 
In terms of sectors where he sees more action, he says, "since people are living longer this means there will be more demand for tourism, which means airlines have a bright future because people will travel. Then, there will be need for hospitality, media and entertainment and of course for those who offer healthcare and wealthcare because as you live longer you also need to plan and manage your wealth".
In healthcare, he says, the focus will be more on consumer wellness and "here it will be more about ways to keep people healthy, important in times where people retire early."
 
In terms of areas of interest and specialisations in business management that he sees emerging and ones that will be in demand, he says: "my view is in future, we will see more action in functional areas of specialisation like MBA in healthcare marketing, or real estate , technology and innovation and of course, entrepreneurship. People will seek specialisations in these areas as they look today for finance, marketing, operations and HR (human resources)."
 
In terms of perceptions about India, where there is scope for improvement, he says that "our problem is (lack of) consistency at all levels." Second, "we tend to have a more outcome-centric mindset than being process-centric." This means the focus is more on getting a work done. In order to ensure there is focus on process and on the right way of doing it, he feels, there should be clear and severe penalties that can act as deterrents.
Jain also serves as an Independent Director on boards of leading companies such as John Deere & Company and Reliance Industries.

Clothes can remake John GallianoMay 17, 2013 6:28 pm
Clothes can remake John Galliano
By Vanessa Friedman
Why the maverick fashion designer needs to dress down
©Splash News
It’s graduate fashion season, that time of year when art schools celebrate their students’ work and show it to the world – and I have atonement on my mind. The connection is less obscure than you might think.
See, next week is the Parsons graduate show and if all had gone to plan, John Galliano might have been in the audience, cheering the kids. Galliano had been booked to teach a “masterclass” at Parsons this spring : a four-day seminar to seniors entitled “Show Me Emotion”. If he had done so, it would have been his second attempt at rehabilitating his image since he was fired by Dior in March 2011 for an anti-Semitic outburst in a Paris bar .
More
Latin lessons in dressing
In this context, the teaching stint wasn’t a bad idea: you know, working with the stars of tomorrow, imparting lessons learnt, all that good stuff. Especially because his first try at reinventing his public persona didn’t go so well.
That took place earlier this year when Galliano was given a three-week “designer in residence” berth in Oscar de la Renta’s New York atelier . Though Galliano had taken care to stay mostly behind the scenes, he made the mistake of leaving his temporary residence in the city shortly after the de la Renta show wearing his classic Olde English hobo garb (striped trousers, black frock coat, black hat, long curls) and was snapped by paparazzi. The photographs found their way to the tabloids, which seized on his costume as quasi-Hasidic, accusing him of insensitivity. So much for that.
The Parsons class also sparked controversy when it was announced. However, the school held firm until about a week ago, when it cancelled the seminar because “an important element of the planned workshop with John Galliano was a candid conversation about the connection between his professional work and his actions in the world at large. Unfortunately, we could not reach consensus with Mr Galliano on the conditions of this conversation, and the program could not move forward.”
Thus, another attempt at a fresh start was scrapped. As I wrote in a blog at the time, on one level I think this is too bad because for students the value of learning from others’ mistakes is at least as valuable, if not more so, than learning from their cutting skills. The decision also deprives those of us who are students of the subject of “how to manage oneself in the world”; of a real-life lesson on how to appear to the public. Or not.
Galliano’s appearance itself has been a lightning rod, first good, then bad, but always wholly and entirely associated with his own identity and fame. He was the original character designer; the man who, at the end of his show every season, would appear in a new guise, be it as toreador, pirate or even astronaut. If anyone should understand the importance of dressing as a penitent, it’s him. I don’t mean in hair shirts or even sackcloth, but it’s all relative: compared with his usual look, jeans and a T-shirt would seem like a statement of contrition.
. . .
Consider the lessons of two non-fashion figures also climbing back from the depths: former Congressman Anthony Weiner (who tweeted embarrassing pictures of his boxer-clad nether regions to the world) and Bob Diamond , the Barclays chief who resigned last year in the wake of the Libor scandal . Both have been edging out into the world in the past few weeks, in part by telling their own story to the New York Times and, in part, via carefully orchestrated photo shoots of them looking like normal folks: Diamond on the train reading a newspaper; Weiner sitting on the floor of his house in jeans and shirtsleeves, playing with his child. In both cases, they are playing the role of the average guy, not the high-flying success story whose hubris led to – well, you know.
And while I’m sure many people read these long newspaper profiles, I bet exponentially more people saw those pictures of them looking humbled. Which is, let’s be frank, what we want from our penitents. We want them to look, and I repeat that word consciously, abashed.
There’s no question that, in the public mind, Galliano’s costumes are associated with his increasingly rarefied life as the head of Dior, a life that ultimately led to his implosion and downfall, or so he said in court, blaming his behaviour on the pressure that led to drink and drugs. To demonstrate a break with the past and that sort of behaviour, the designer should demonstrate a break with the dress. If he is repudiating that life and constructing a new one, as friends have said, he should also repudiate that garb.
Imagine the shock if Galliano had shown up for his Parsons class, and for the graduate show, not in a three-piece tweed suit with elbow patches and a pipe, caricaturing a professor, but in short hair (or ponytail), jeans and a jacket, much like any other teacher at the school. It would have been a paparazzi shot sent round the world: not Clapton unplugged but Galliano laid bare.
Maybe next time.

Big Billion Day: Marked up prices  crashing server spoil Flipkart party‘Marked up’ prices, server crash spoil Flipkart party
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 06, 2014
First Published: 17:23 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 12:53 IST(7/10/2014)

The great deals and discounts that e-commerce majors such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and others are announcing in full-page advertisements every day this festive season may not all be for real.
India’s biggest e-commmerce company, Flipkart, in particular earned the ire of disgruntled shoppers by offering some supposedly discounted items at prices higher than what rivals such as Amazon and Snapdeal were offering.
For instance, a MacBookAir 13” was priced at Rs. 56,490 on Flipkart but Snapdeal sold it for Rs. 49,999.
In other instances, the company allegedly marked up the retail prices of some products and then offered “discounts” that brought the selling prices close to market rates.
“But the digital customer is smart. With so many social sites, it will be difficult to pull a wool over their eyes. They will see through any such attempt,” said Sandeep Komaravelly, senior VP (marketing) at rival Snapdeal.com.
To be fair, this practice of ramping up prices and then offering a “discount” was not true for all products, since a few discounts were genuine and lapped up by the customers.
Flipkart’s big festive season sale, The Big Billion Day, overburdened its servers, which crashed within two hours of the sale opening, angering shoppers further. “The traffic was heavy but our server did not crash,” a Flipkart spokesperson said, but refused to give any details.
Shoppers took to Twitter, Facebook and blogging to attack the company’s pricing.
A Twitter user, @Surnell, posted screenshots of what purported to show Flipkart raising prices of a product in the run-up to the sale only to slap a discount on Monday.
Dear @Flipkart Your 29% Discount demystified pic.twitter.com/U7rXfLkBty
— Suresh En (@surnell) October 6, 2014
“We got a billion hits on our site today and achieved our 24 hour sales target of $100 million (Rs 600 crore) in gross merchandise value (industry lingo for sales) in just 10 hours.
We are truly humbled by the immense faith our customers have shown in us,” Flipkart’s promoters Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said in a statement on Monday evening.
Underlining the fierce battle for customers among e-commerce companies, Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, bought the domain name “bigbillionday.com” (Flipkart’s name for its sale), which redirects customers to amazon.com and trolls Flipkart.
Monday’s sale brought hordes of shoppers not only to Flipkart but to other retailers as well. “We have seen a 30% jump today and over the last week, the traffic has been 10% higher than what we get very month,” Snapdeal’s Komaravelly.
Amazon spokesperson said, “Today, on the last day of our ‘Mission to Mars’ campaign, we have witnessed a 100% increase in sales since yesterday.
It is our biggest day ever and we believe it is owed to the introduction of Dhamaka deals every hour through the day  and ensuring the availability of the deals advertised.”
Amazon will hold week three of the “Online Shopping Dhamaka” festive celebrations followed by the “Diwali Dhamaka Week” starting October 10.

Facebook closes WhatsApp purchase now worth $21.8 billion

New York: Facebook has completed its acquisition of the mobile messaging service WhatsApp for almost $22 billion, up from the original $19 billion when the cash-and-stock deal was struck early this year thanks in part to the rising price of Facebook shares.
Facebook named WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum to its board Monday. WhatsApp is by far the largest acquisition for the Menlo Park, California company, and bigger than any deals made by Google, Microsoft or Apple.
The price that Facebook was willing to pay raised eyebrows when the buyout was announced February 19, though analysts agreed that landing the popular site made sense. Including cash, stock and restricted stock awarded to WhatsApp employees, the deal is worth $21.8 billion based on Facebook's stock price on Monday.
Facebook, which has its own mobile messaging app called Messenger, plans to keep WhatsApp as a separate service.
#facebook #whatsapp #facebook whatsapp deal
WhatsApp has been growing rapidly, especially in developing countries like Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia, and now has more than 500 million users.
WhatsApp lets users chat with their phone contacts, both one-on-one and in groups. It also allows people to send texts, photos, videos and voice recordings over the Internet and lets them text or call people overseas without heavy charges. Free to use for the first year and costing $1 per year after that, the service has no advertising.
Facebook, which has its own mobile messaging app called Messenger, plans to keep WhatsApp as a separate service.
The acquisition was approved by antitrust authority of the European Union on Friday.
Facebook's shares climbed 32 cents to $77.76 in afternoon trading on Monday.

A week after they were assaulted by a mob at the Rajiv Chowk metro station, the three Africans have found support in fellow students. Two of the three students who were assaulted are students of Amity University, Noida.
Amity students have now decided to approach the university administration to fund the students’ treatment.
“What happened to the students was deplorable and we stand with them. I am planning to talk to the university and find a way to help them raise funds for their treatment,” said Uttam Poudyal, a student from Nepal.
The two students from Amity are from Gabon and the third is from Burkina Faso. They we re attacked after they allegedly misbehaved with a woman on the metro.
The Amity University students have made a Facebook page called the Humans of Amity. The page started by Poudyal gives a different version of the events that took place on that day.
“We were traveling in the metro and a few guys started clicking our pictures. When we asked them why they were doing so, they started misbehaving. That ultimately led the metro staff to take us and those guys to the police officer’s cabin. Even there, they kept passing racist comments, which made us also furious. This ultimately led to a fight. We were beaten up by a majority of people around us at that time. There was so much blood. We bled a lot but no one cared,” wrote Yohan Koumba Daouda.
They pointed out how their parents were worried about their well being. “My parents are worried. They’ve made an opinion now that this place is not safe for me. My mother cries every day. My father has become so worried that he wants me to leave India. But it is about my education. I want to get a degree. And I’ve promised my parents to never travel in Delhi metro again,” said Mapaga Yannis.
Both are students at the Amity Institute of Information Technology. The university is yet to receive any such request.

M&M arm to acquire 51% stake in Peugeot Motocycles

Pawan Goenka, Executive Director, Mahindra & Mahindra (file photo)
Coimbatore, Oct 7:  
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd's subsidiary has made a "binding offer" to acquire majority stake in Peugeot Motocycles of France for an undisclosed sum.
In a communication to the stock exchanges, M&M said that its unlisted subsidiary Mahindra Two Wheelers Ltd (MTWL) has made a binding offer to acquire a 51 per cent stake in Peugeot Motocycles which is part of the euro 54 billion PSA Group of France.
M&M said PMTC is a key player in urban mobility in Europe for 116 years and the oldest motorized two-wheeler manufacturer in the world.
The deal between MTWL and PSA is subject to Works Council consultation as part of the employee dialogue process and anti-trust law. It would involve pumping in Euro 15 million into PMTC to finance projects that were implemented through the strategic partnership and additional sale of shares by PSA allowing MTWL to acquire 51 per cent shareholding in PMTC, M&M said.
PTI reports: Commenting on the development, M&M Executive Director Pawan Goenka said: “The coming together of Mahindra and Peugeot is a win—win for the two—wheeler businesses of both companies. Mahindra would offer access to the Indian market, mass market product technology and competence in marketing while Peugeot brings premium range, a strong European footprint, and a globally recognised brand.”
This partnership would enable both MTWL and PMTC to speed up their international expansion by driving synergies and leveraging respective strengths of both parties, he added.
Over the past few years, Mahindra has strengthened its position in the two-wheeler segment globally. Mahindra Racing competes at the highest level of global motorcycle racing in the Moto3 category of MotoGP, while Mahindra GenZe recently revealed its electric two—wheelers in the US market that offer sustainable urban transport solutions to a new generation of US consumers.
The company had recently launched Gusto scooter. MTWL also has sales and distribution operations in Latin America, Africa and South Asia. It has assembly operations in many of these markets.

PMO to get go-to persons for American  Japan...Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has identified two senior joint-secretary level officials in his office who would be the "go-to" persons for Japanese and American companies wanting to invest in India. These officials would work through different ministries to facilitate foreign investments and projects.
During his breakfast meeting with US CEOs, PM Modi told the assembled gathering they could approach his office directly as he tried to hardsell the "ease of business" credentials of his government. In Japan, Modi had identified another senior official to be the pointperson for Japanese companies. In fact, there would be a Japanese-speaking official to coordinate with them so they feel more comfortable.
This is in addition to a problem-resolution mechanism and facilitation arrangements that will be set up in the finance ministry as part of the US-India investment initiative.
During his conversations with US CEOs, Modi focused on three important aspects--retrospective taxation, electronics and the coal verdict.
On the first, PM assured the CEOs that there would be no such imposition from his government, though it would be a while before the offending law can be taken off the books. A recent Supreme Court judgment has stated any additional taxes should only be prospective in nature, which is being seen as clarifying the intent of governments in future.
Modi also asked Eric Schmidt of Google to manufacture the next generation of cellphones in India. Modi spent a lot of time discussing the fact that electronics imports would become India's top imports by 2017. This is one of the factors behind Modi's massive "Make in India" initiative. Of course the problem is the poor logistics and transport infrastructure that prevents movement of components swiftly from port to factory. Ironically, for India to become a centre for global electronics manufacturing, the trade facilitation agreement which India has blocked, will be key.
The third issue which was discussed by Modi was the recent cancellation of coal mining licenses by the Supreme Court. PM reportedly assured US corporates that he had been presented with some options and would announce a decision soon. Keen on converting the setback into an opportunity, PM said the options presented to him ranged from re-auctioning the mining blocks, allowing Indian companies to partner with foreign ones or allowing the Indian public sector giant to partner with Indian and foreign companies.

What’s stopping you from getting rich? Not bad luck, but faulty investing strategies

(If you really want to get…)
You are a diligent saver, a careful investor and a meticulous planner. Yet, you have not been able to build wealth even as everyone around you seems to be wallowing in money. What's stopping you from getting rich? If it's bad luck, you can buy one of those good fortune charms hawked on late night TV shows. But if you really want to get to the root of the problem, you need to assess where you are going wrong in your investments.
Our cover story this week is about the money myths and investing flaws that prevent you from getting rich. It could be the lure of penny stocks or the tantalising potential of the futures and options segment. Small investors often lose their shirts (and nearly everything else) when they enter these high-risk arenas without adequate knowledge.
But mistakes can happen even if you play ultra safe. If a fixed deposit offers 9%, the post-tax returns for someone in the 30% tax bracket will be barely 6.3%. That's not too bad until you factor in 8% inflation. So even though the investor does not feel it, his money is losing value. This is one of the biggest investing mistakes Indians make when they pour money into fixed deposits. In the following pages, we have listed the common hurdles that prevent investors from getting rich.
Many of these hurdles are really self made. They can be done away with by changing your approach to investing. Gold, for instance, should not occupy more than 5-10% allocation in your portfolio. This can happen if you treat the yellow metal less as an investment and more as a hedging tool.
There's no point in dwelling on mistakes unless we can offer a solution. So, each financial mistake has been followed by advice on how to avoid it. This stress on utility has been ET Wealth's hallmark since the time it was launched. In this 200th issue of the newspaper, we hope to live up to the expectations of our readers.

India services growth quickened in Sept: HSBC PMIServices sector regains pace after two month break
Shishir Sinha
Reuters Activity in the private sector has expanded steadily since May.
New Delhi, Oct 7:  
Contrary to the manufacturing sector, the services sector in India accelerated in September, a survey by HSBC indicated.
Result of the survey is known as HSBC Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) and it rose to 51.6 in September from 50.6 in August. The index is calculated on the basis of response received from 350 purchasing managers of private companies. These companies comprise hotels & restaurants, transport & storage, financial intermediation, renting & business activities, post & telecommunication and other services. Index above 50 reflects expansion while below 50 means contraction.
“Services sector activity bottomed out in September thanks to stronger new business flows. However, business sentiment continues to deteriorate after a strong post-election uptick,” Frederic Neumann, Co-Head of Asian Economic Research at HSBC, said. On the positive side, employment rose and inflation fell significantly. A pick up in reform effort is sorely needed to put growth on a firmer footing and address supply side risks to inflation, he added.
Although slower growth in manufacturing did make an impact, services covered a large area. That is why the HSBC Composite Output Index rose to 51.8 in September as against 51.6 in August. The survey said that the latest reading was consistent with a moderate expansion in private sector output. Indian manufacturers signalled a slowdown in output growth, in contrast to the accelerated expansion in activity recorded at services companies.
In terms of services sector, the survey also mentioned that the business activity rose in half of the six monitored subsectors, with by far the sharpest expansion noted in Post & Telecommunications. It noted growth of new businesses for fifth consecutive months. “Moreover, the pace of expansion picked up from August and was solid overall,” it said.

Gold futures fall marginally on global cuesGold futures fall marginally on global cues

New Delhi, Oct 7:  
Gold prices fell by 0.16 per cent to Rs 26,678 per ten grams in futures trade today as speculators indulged in trimming positions in tandem with a weak global trend.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in December fell by Rs 43, or 0.16 per cent, to Rs 26,678 per ten grams in a business turnover of 409 lots.
Similarly, the metal for delivery in February 2014 contracts lost Rs 21, or 0.08 per cent, to Rs 26,883 per ten grams in a business turnover of just one lot.
Analysts attributed the fall in gold futures to trimming of positions by speculators in tandem with a weak global trend as the dollar advanced towards a four-year high, reducing demand for precious metals as an alternative investment.
Meanwhile, gold fell 0.4 per cent to US $ 1,203.02 an ounce in Singapore in early trade today.

Indian economy to grow 6.4% in 2015-16: World BankIndian economy to grow 6.4% in 2015-16: World Bank
PTI
Tweet
Washington, Oct 7:  
Indian economy, which accounts for 80 per cent of South Asia’s output, is set to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2015-16 as against 5.6 per cent in 2014-15, the World Bank has said.
With economic activity buoyed by expectations from the new elected government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, “India is benefiting from a “Modi dividend“,” the Bank said in its twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus report yesterday.
Over the next year or so economic growth should be supported by the recovering US economy that would provide a market for Indian merchandise and service exports, it said.
“The outlook over the next years for South Asia indicates broad economic stability and a pick-up in growth with potential risks concentrated on the fiscal and structural reform side,” said Martin Rama, Chief Economist for South Asia at the World Bank.
“Future growth will increasingly depend on strong investment and export performance,” he added.
Private investment is expected to pick up thanks to the government’s business orientation, and declining oil prices should boost private sector competitiveness.
But economic reforms will be needed for India to achieve its full long-term growth potential, the report argued.
The report said the region’s economy will expand by a real 6 per cent in 2015 and by 6.4 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.4 per cent this year, potentially making it the second fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific.
Other countries in the region are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The Bank said India’s long-term growth potential remains high due to favourable demographics, relatively high savings, and policies and efforts to improve skills and education, facilitate domestic market integration and incentivize manufacturing activities.
In the medium term, with the economy still below potential and reforms on a gradualist path, growth is expected to accelerate from 5.6 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent and 7 per cent in 2016 and 2017.
Inflation is expected to decline with monetary policy switching to inflation targeting while the current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat as import demand and capital inflows rise.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue with stronger revenue mobilisation, while the oil subsidy burden could decline to 0.6 per cent of GDP if benign global crude prices persist, it said.
Supply chain delays and uncertainty are a major yet under-appreciated constraint to manufacturing growth and competitiveness in India, it said.

Ebola scare: Spanish nurse gets Ebola; a first in WestPrint

In a case underscoring the perils of caring for Ebola patients, a nurse in Spain has contracted the disease — the first time the virus has spread outside West Africa during the current epidemic.
The nurse’s illness illustrates the danger that health care workers face not only in poorly equipped West African clinics, but also in the more sophisticated medical centers of Europe and the United States.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, says health care workers are at the greatest risk in all Ebola outbreaks.
The development came Monday as another American sick with the disease arrived back in the U.S. for treatment and President Barack Obama said the government was considering ordering more careful screening of airline passengers traveling from the outbreak region.

As oil prices tank  new era of abundance see...As oil prices tank, new era of abundance seen dawning

The fact that oil prices are falling despite continued turmoil in much of the Middle East and sanctions on Russia "is a milestone, a marker of change."
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
As oil production swells, demand falters and prices slide, the global oil market appears on the verge of a pivotal shift from an era of scarcity to one of abundance.
Oil prices have fallen as much as 20 per cent since June, despite a host of rising supply risks, leading more investors and traders to consider whether 2015 is the year in which the US shale oil boom finally tips the world into surplus.
While the plunge has rekindled speculation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may need to cut output for the first time in six years when it meets next month, some analysts are looking much further ahead.
They say a long-anticipated fundamental shift in the market may now be under way, ending a four-year stretch when $100-plus prices were the norm, and opening a new era in which OPEC restraint once again becomes paramount.
The signs are everywhere: US oil imports are shrinking much faster than expected while oil production climbs to a thirty-year high. Chinese economic growth , and therefore oil demand growth, is slowing. Even output in trouble spots like Libya and Iraq is rising after years of insurrection-led losses.
What is happening in oil markets "finally represent the rebalancing and the impact of this tremendous surge in US oil production," says Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman of IHS and one of the world's foremost oil historians.
The fact that oil prices are falling despite continued turmoil in much of the Middle East and sanctions on Russia "is a milestone, a marker of change."
Some analysts say it is too early to tell if the latest fall in prices is any different from previous declines, such as in 2012 and 2013, when events such as civil war in Libya and sanctions on Iran spurred sharp rebounds.
A spurt in economic growth in Europe or another supply disruption could again push prices higher in the short term, but risks appear increasingly skewed lower.
Last week analysts at Credit Suisse cut their 2016 Brent oil price forecast to $93 a barrel, the second-lowest among analysts polled by Reuters. The consensus for that year was over $101 a barrel. The bank pegged 2017 at $88 a barrel as North American output growth "overwhelms" global demand.
Some oil traders agree. Long-dated futures for 2017 and beyond, which had for months held firm despite the slump in immediate prices, finally fell last week. Global benchmark Brent crude for November fell 5 per cent last week, hitting its lowest in over two years.
The implications of such a shift extend well beyond OPEC. It would likely accelerate shifts in the global balance of power, with consumer nations such as the United States becoming less dependent on producers like Russia or Iran.
END OF AN ERA
For most of the past decade, the oil market has been defined by shortage. Prior to 2008, years of underinvestment, roaring demand from Asia and fears of a looming "Peak Oil" fueled the price rally, and OPEC members have struggled to keep up with demand. Oil soared to nearly $150 a barrel by mid-2008.
Then, the financial crisis sent prices into a tailspin, forcing OPEC to make two sharp cuts - as it turns out, its last formal measures for at least six years. With demand stunted and US shale breakthrough, the "Peak Oil" theme faded giving way to hope for abundance.
Yet oil prices held resolutely above $100 a barrel, with each potential downturn eventually thwarted.
In 2011, it was the breakdown in OPEC member Libya that fueled gains, cutting supplies by as much as 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd); later that year and in 2012, it was US and European sanctions on Iran that choked off some of supply. Last summer it was Libya again as violence flared anew.
TEST FOR OPEC...AND SHALE PRODUCERS
The same could happen again next year. Growing tensions with Russia are putting supplies from the world's No. 2 producer at risk. Talks with Iran over a nuclear deal could sour, prompting calls to ratchet up sanctions. Yet the odds for another rebound are growing longer.
"The fire drill may be real this time," says Daniel Sternoff at Medley Global Advisors.
Now, either OPEC agrees to put a floor under prices in the short-term, or a prolonged period of lower prices starts to curb long-term investment or revive demand growth, he says.
The price downturn is not only testing OPEC's resolve but also the durability of the US shale revolution, which has added 1 million bpd to US output in each of the past 3 years.
It is far from clear when, or whether, OPEC will intervene. Sharp cuts in Saudi Arabia's oil sale price to Asian customers on Wednesday suggested that the world's largest oil producer will accept lower prices to maintain market share.
Bob McNally, a White House adviser to former President George W. Bush and now president of the Rapidan Group energy consultancy, said after a recent trip to Saudi Arabia that OPEC producers might wait for US output cuts rather than cut production themselves. While some in OPEC are starting to call for cuts, core Gulf members are betting winter demand will revive the market.
That may change if oil prices slide another $10 or so. Not only will that squeeze budgets from Caracas to Moscow, but US drillers would probably curb activity in the event of a "sustained pullback" below $80 a barrel, analysts at Baird Energy wrote in a report on Monday.
"US shale oil after all is not just the newest and biggest source of supply, but also high cost and most responsive to oil prices," said McNally. "North Dakota and Texas have effectively joined OPEC, though they may not have realized it yet."

Jayalalithaa bail plea hearing in Karnataka HC shortlyHundreds of supporters protested on the streets and shouted slogans on Tuesday after the Karnataka High Court denied bail to AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa who was jailed by a Bengaluru court in a corruption case last month.
 
Jayalalithaa was forced to step down as chief minister of Tamil Nadu after being found guilty of amassing wealth beyond her known sources of income and was replaced by her close aide O Panneerselvam. The Bengaluru special court handed her a four-year prison sentence and a Rs100-crore penalty.
 
Unless the conviction is overturned by a higher court, the AIADMK chief will be disqualified from contesting elections for a period of 10 years from the date of the verdict.
 
Celebrations by the party cadre fizzled out after initial media reports that Jayalalithaa had been granted bail turned out to be incorrect. Tight security was in place around the high court complex with police anticipating a rush of AIADMK supporters and leaders.

Rejecting Jayalalithaa’s plea, justice AV Chandrashekhara said there were no grounds for granting bail and reacted sharply when Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said he would not oppose if bail was granted conditionally. “The public prosecutor filed strong written objections but when he was asked to present arguments before this court, he said no objection.”
The bail petitions of Jayalalithaa's associates Sasikala Natarajan, VK Sudhakaran and J Ilavarasi were also rejected on the same grounds. The AIADMK chief is likely to approach the Supreme Court in appeal on Wednesday.
Citing several orders of the apex court, the judge said, “Suspension of sentence is not automatic (when an appeal is filed). Bail at conviction stage is different from bail when trial is on.”
“Corruption amounts to violation of human rights and leads to economic imbalance,” the judge added.
Watch: Jayalalithaa’s bail plea rejected by Karnataka HC
 
The 66-year-old AIADMK chief, a former movie star, has a cult following in her state and is renowned for distributing free laptops, jewellery and fans to voters.
On Tuesday morning, posters saying Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu would be held hostage if Jayalalithaa was not released from jail sprung up in parts of Chennai.
The AIADMK tried to distance itself from the row and its workers tore down the sheets allegedly put up by an expelled party member.

“Warning...immediately release people's Chief Minister Amma...otherwise we will hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu as hostages,” read the message which also bore the name of several AIADMK members.
The party said the posters were put up without its knowledge and stressed that it stood committed to the welfare of all sections of society.
 

Maharashtra polls: Raj Thackeray slams PM Modi  asks why is he still obsessed with Gujarat19
0
Mumbai: With less than 10 days left for the Maharashtra Assembly elections, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for only focusing on Gujarat and not concentrating on the rest of the country. Speaking exclusively to Network18, Thackeray also clarified that his party had nothing to do with the Shiv Sena.
Thackeray said, "The time has come for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give up his love for Gujarat and become a national leader. Even when he went to the US, Barack Obama greeted him with the words 'Khem Cho'. Obama greeted the PM of India in Gujarat, I felt happy that Obama made that effort for an Indian leader but I thought to myself- why Gujarati?"
He hit out at Modi for only working for Gujarat's development. Thackeray said, "All the work that PM Modi has done since coming to power is for his beloved Gujarat. The bullet trains he wants- will run from Mumbai to Ahmedabad. Who will take these trains?
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #maharashtra #mns #raj thackeray
"Why still the obsession with Gujarat? He might have become the Prime Minister based on the work that he did for Gujarat but now his focus should be on developing India as a whole."
Thackeray also held the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party responsible for no development in the state because they have no rooting in the ground realities of Maharashtra. "They are in essence national parties, even the BJP will not be able to do much for the state," Thackeray added.
On not allying with Shiv Sena, MNS said, "Sena's ideology is Hindutva, ours is local. We are fighting on the plank of rights for the Marathi manus, for the people of Maharashtra. There is nothing common between us and Sena.
"If voted to power, I want to make Marathi the medium of education in schools. There should be pride associated with your own mother tongue. One should be able to think in one's mother tongue. That is my goal," he said.

Chennai/Bangalore: Emotions are running high as the Karnataka High Court is set to take up former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa's bail application in the disproportionate assets case. An AIADMK poster threatens to hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu hostage if Jayalalithaa is not released.
MN Reddy, Commissioner of Police, Bangalore has spoken to COP of Chennai regarding the Anti Kannadiga Posters. COP Chennai has said there is no danger to Kannadigas in Tamil Nadu and also promised to get the Anti Kannadiga Posters removed and initiate action against the miscreants immediately.
Prohibitory orders have been imposed around the Bangalore central jail. Several AIADMK members along with MLAs have been on a dawn to dusk fast since September 27 when Jayalalithaa was found guilty in this case.
#jayalalithaa #tamil nadu #kannadigas #disproportionate assets case
A signature campaign is also being organised in support of Jayalalithaa and many sportspersons have joined the campaign. Private engineering colleges, however, will remain open across Tamil Nadu, reversing an earlier decision to show support to Jayalalithaa.
The Madras High Court has said that there would be no holiday for schools and colleges on Tuesday and warned the Tamil Nadu government that it would be held responsible for any untoward incident and breakdown of law and order in connection with agitations against the conviction of Jayalalithaa.
The Karnataka High Court vacation bench had on October 1 deferred till October 7 pleas of Jayalalithaa and her close aide Sasikala and her relatives VN Sudhakaran and Elavarasi, who were also convicted in the case, to be taken by a regular bench after the end of Dasara vacation. "We have made all security arrangements to avoid any untoward incidents. We have information on a lot of AIADMK supporters and leaders flocking to the city from the border areas of Hosur," ACP (Law and Order) Alok Kumar told PTI.
The police are prepared for the influx of AIADMK supporters and leaders, who are camping in various lodges and resorts on the eve of Jayalalithaa's bail plea hearing, Kumar said. "Let them come. We have handled the situation on earlier occasions--on the verdict day and bail plea hearing days. We will handle the situation this time too," Kumar said.
Section 144 of the Cr.P.C has been clamped within 1 km radius of the High Court and Parapanna Agrahara Prison, where Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Elavarasi are also lodged.
Jayalalithaa's counsel Ram Jethmalani had on October 1 pleaded for suspension of the sentence pending appeal and for her release on bail, which was opposed by Special Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh, who was the SPP in the Special Court in the disproportionate assets case.
In his verdict on September 27, Special Judge John Michael D'Cunha had convicted Jayalalithaa, sentencing her to four years imprisonment, and slapped a staggering fine of Rs 100 crore in the corruption case. Sasikala, Sudhakaran, disowned foster son of the former Chief Minister, and Elavarasi were also sentenced to four years in jail, besides a fine of Rs 10 crore each. In her petitions seeking immediate bail and challenging her sentence, Jayalalithaa has maintained that the charges of amassing wealth against her were false and that she had acquired property through legal means.

Kolkata rickshaw-puller pedals his way to Ladakh99
1
Kolkata: A rickshaw-puller from the city pedalled for two months and covered a 3,000-km arduous journey to reach distant Ladakh valley to become the first man to achieve the feat.
After riding his rickshaw for 68 days through Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Srinagar and Kargil, 44-year-old Satyen Das said he had crossed the famous Khardung La pass in Ladakh on August 17.
He returned home a few days ago and is now eyeing an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records for plying rickshaw at an altitude above of 5000 metres. His trip was financed by the Naktala Agrani Club in south Kolkata.
"After I crossed Pathankot in Jammu and Kashmir, locals told me that they had never seen a rickshaw in their village," Das said.
#kolkata #ladakh #kolkata rickshaw puller
The secretary of the club, Patho Dey, said, "We estimated that the trip would cost around Rs 80,000 which we raised from among club members. We were impressed by his passion and determination to undertake the adventure."
"After I crossed Pathankot in Jammu and Kashmir, locals told me that they had never seen a rickshaw in their village," Das said.
He said his journey was meant to promote rickshaw as a means of eco-friendly transport as well as to spread the message of world peace.
To record the feat, a documentary filmmaker from Kolkata accompanied him. He was also armed with maps to help him pick his way through.
This is not the first time Das undertook such a journey. Way back in 2008 he had gone all the way to Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh in a rickshaw with his wife and daughter.
The best and the most challenging part of his journey was passing through an elevation of 17,582 feet at Khardung La pass which offers stunning views of the magnificent Himalayas.

LONDON, Oct 7:  
Oil explorer Cairn Energy and its joint venture partners have discovered oil at a well offshore Senegal and further exploration work nearby is already planned, the company said on Tuesday.
The companies encountered 29 metres of net oil bearing reservoir at the FAN-1 well, located around 100 km off the coastline and 1,427 metres deep.
"We have encountered a very substantial oil bearing interval which may have significant potential as a standalone discovery," said Cairn Energy chief executive Simon Thomson.
Cairn Energy has a 40 per cent interest in three offshore blocks in Senegal, while ConocoPhillips has 35 per cent, FAR Ltd 15 per cent and Senegal's national oil company Petrosen owns 10 per cent.

Sensex down over 100 points; Hindalco  HDFC top losersNifty hovers around 7,900; HDFC down 3%
SI Reporter | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 12:55 PM IST
Markets continue to trade in the negative territory with the BSE benchmark index down 124 points at 26,443 and the Nifty was hovering around the 7,900 mark at 7,902, down 43 points.
Earlier in the day, Nifty had slipped to a low of 7,883 as selling in index heavyweights weighed on the index.
Losses in L&T, HDFC and M&M alone contributed to a 144 points cut seen on the Sensex.
The broader markets were flat with a divergent trend. The smallcap index was up nearly 0.1% while the midcap index slipped by 0.05%.
Meanwhile in Asia, shares rose while the dollar languished after investors locked in some gains on its recent rally. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up about 0.3 percent in late afternoon trade, after wobbling between positive and negative territory as it took its cues from a choppy, losing session on Wall Street overnight.
Japan's Nikkei stock average ended down 0.7 percent, after the Bank of Japan offered a bleaker view on factory output. The BOJ maintained its massive asset buying programme, as widely expected.
The BOJ's policy meeting on Tuesday was interrupted because Governor Haruhiko Kuroda was summoned to speak in parliament, a rare event that last happened in September 1998.

Growth in services activity picked up pace in September as order books filled up at a faster rate, a business survey showed on Tuesday.
The HSBC Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 51.6 in September from 50.6 in August, reversing a slowdown seen in the previous two months.
Meanwhile, the provisional data released by the stock exchanges after trading hours on Wednesday, 1 October 2014, showed that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 63.24 crore on that day.
After a long weekend, the rupee strengthened by 22 paise to 61.39 against the dollar in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange today on increased selling of the US currency by exporters and banks.

Japanese stocks clawed back early losses on Tuesday in response to comments from the Bank of Japan governor on the impact of the weak yen, but investors remained cautions ahead of the bank's policy decision later in the day.
"In general, a weak yen has some positive effect on exports and capital expenditure by pushing up revenues at companies with operations overseas. On the other hand, it's true a weak yen weighs on non-manufacturers' revenues by pushing up import costs," Kuroda told a parliament committee meeting in the morning.
The Nikkei share average, which started in negative territory, ended the morning session flat at 15,897.31 after flirting with positive territory.

Gold holds above $1 200 | Brent falls below $93Brent falls away from $93 as oversupply concerns return
By Reuters | 7 Oct, 2014, 12.17PM IST
Crude oil futures reversed course on Monday with Brent ending the session higher after falling earlier, following a slump in the US dollar.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: Brent crude slipped further away from $93 a barrel on Tuesday and partially erased the previous session's gains, with concerns about abundant supply outweighing the positive boost to prices from the US dollar's recent weakness.
Oil futures reversed course on Monday with Brent ending the session higher after falling earlier, following a slump in the US dollar. The dollar suffered its biggest one-day drop since January on Monday against a basket of major currencies, but steadied in the Asian time zone on Tuesday.
An increase in the US dollar makes oil more costly for buyers using other currencies.
The rally in oil prices on Monday was a short-term reaction to the fall in the dollar, said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets .
"The momentum (in oil prices) has been downward. One of the key bits of news is Saudi Arabia cutting prices. This removes any near term potential for production cuts," leaving oversupplied oil markets to weigh on prices, Spooner said.
Saudi Aramco will sharply cut official oil prices for Asian customers in November, the state-run company said on Oct. 1, in the clearest sign yet the OPEC member and world's largest exporter is trying to compete for crude market share.
Brent was down 9 cents at $92.70 a barrel by 0558 GMT after ending 48 cents higher in the previous session. It hit an intraday low of $91.25 a barrel on Monday.
US crude dropped 4 cents to $90.30 after it settled 60 cents higher on Monday.
While oil prices have dropped amid oversupply following a growth in US shale oil and a rebound in Libyan exports, budget constraints could put a floor on prices, said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Sydney's Ayers Alliance.
"I think there is already a floor in the price in terms of the cost of production of supply," Barratt said.
The limit was around $85 per barrel for Saudi Arabian crude and US shale derived oil, he said, adding that if oil prices fell below that level producers would cut output because it would start to become uneconomic.
Investors are now waiting for US crude inventory data for clues on demand at the world's top oil consumer.
US crude stocks rose by 1.4 million barrels last week to 358 million barrels, according to a Reuters poll ahead of weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Oil prices were still vulnerable to geopolitical shocks from the Middle East and Ukraine, although for now the market has stripped out any risk premium, Spooner and Barratt said.
Fighting raged between Kurdish defenders and Islamic State militants in Kobani, a town on the Syrian-Turkish border, on Monday in an assault that has lasted almost three weeks.
NATO would support member Turkey if it came under attack from fighting involving Islamic State militants in neighbouring Syria, alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday.
Germany and France will present a new proposal shortly under which their soldiers could help monitor a ceasefire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, a German foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday.

Modi dividend may push up growth  says World BankCare Ratings
(The World Bank calls for…)
NEW DELHI: A 'Modi dividend' could lift India's economic growth to 6.4% in 2015-16, the World Bank has said, referring to a possible boost to the animal spirits of entrepreneurs due to the coming to power in May of a government perceived to be more market-friendly than the previous one.
"The Indian economy , 80% of the (South Asia) region's output, is set to grow by 6.4% in 2015-16 after 5.6% in 2014-15...India is benefiting from a 'Modi dividend'," noted the World Bank's bi-annual report, South Asia Economic Focus. Apart from the rather unusual personalisation of the sources of India's economic growth, the report is otherwise along conventional lines.
China's Growth Will Slow to 7.2%
The World Bank calls for structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic management for a better medium-term outcome. "The Modi effect is definitely playing out as far as capital inflows are concerned. Inflation needs to trend downwards, but the external and fiscal positions look very promising," said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at SBI.
He added that the current year's growth could turn out to be higher than the 5.6% estimated by the World Bank. As far as India's giant neighbour is concerned, the World Bank has estimated that China's growth will slow to 7.2% next year, a cut from the 7.5% estimated in April this year. The bank also does not see any threat for India because of the likely withdrawal of US monetary stimulus over the rest of 2014 and 2015, as the economy is now stronger in terms of its ability to manage current account.
India's economic growth will accelerate to touch the 7% mark in 2016-17, according to the report, which took note of recent policy measures undertaken. These include liberalisation of foreign direct investment in railways and defence, disbanding of the Planning Commission and its replacement by an economic advisory body, financial inclusion as well as actions to simplify land acquisition and reform labour laws.
India's economy turned around sharply in the first quarter of 2014-15 to grow at 5.8%, bucking the dismal sub-5% growth of the last two years. "India's growth performance remains strong vis-a-vis emerging market peers," the World Bank said. Private investment is expected to pick up thanks to the new government's business orientation and declining oil prices should boost private sector competitiveness, it added. "The 'Modi Dividend' is coming out from the positive sentiment, as reflected in the stock market .
All economic indicators look positive, aided by the base effect and actual recovery in some areas. But there is a lot of resolution shown by the government in areas like fiscal deficit and current account deficit. We expect economy to see an all round recovery soon," said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings .

Modi govt has formed a base; growth may hit 7-8% next year: SBIArundhati Bhattacharya
("India has been brought…)
In a chat with ET Now, Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairman, SBI, talks about their new initiative SBI InTouch and also shares her business and macroeconomic outlook. Excerpts:
ET Now: Tell us about SBI InTouch. What this new and swanky branch is all about and are you looking at opening more such branches? Will there be more tie-ups with various IT companies?
Arundhati Bhattacharya: We felt that it is necessary to create a sub-brand within SBI for the youth because we found that the youth perceive the State Bank of India to be very trustworthy, but it is perceived as your parent's banker, not really their banker.
With that in mind, we looked around to see what is it that the youth relate to and they relate very well to the digital experience. That being the case, we thought that we should go in for digital branches. The difference is these branches are located in malls, high street shopping areas, and sometimes in the SEZs where you have a large number of young customers. These branches do not have the standard chairs and tables, they do not have cash and basically, they give you what is called the immersive digital experience.
There are machines that will allow you to open your accounts. If you have an Aadhaar number and the scanning of your fingerprint, you will be able to get an account opened. You will be able to get a personalised debit card also from the card machine that is right next to the ATM kiosk. Other than that, there will be screens which will enable you to look for what you want. If you want a car loan, you can actually find out what are the models within the amount that you want. It will also give you the social networking feed which will tell you what people are saying about these models, what are the manufacturers claiming that these models are like. It will enable you at the same time to plan your loans.
If you give them the income criteria, they will tell you how much of loans are available. Similar to this, over a period of time, we will have the entire home loans being done out of this. Also things like vacation packages, education loans will all be covered here. We also have some little cubicles which we call remote pods. These will be available with remote experts and if you call them up, they will guide you and handhold you through any kind of loans you want to take.
ET Now: Having this virtual branch per se and also all the other automated transactions that the banks are now adopting, it will actually help you ease the pressure of manpower crunch that you will be facing because it says that in another four years, you could see nearly 40000 people retiring. So do you think that it will help bring down the cost as well as also help solve that particular problem to some extent?
Arundhati Bhattacharya: Definitely to some extent because while we have 40000 people retiring and we may take in 40000 also, but on the other side, you also have to understand that our demography is such that I will be getting many more customers. So it is not so much a question of people retiring, but it is also a question of our number of customers getting ramped up. This entire InTouch experience will shortly be also available on the mobile. So, people will be able to do everything that you are seeing over here in the comfort of their homes and if that is the case, obviously the requirements for people can come down.
  ET Now: Would you be interested in having a large telecommunication company being as a BC model for SBI? You have the customer base and definitely, it will make a good concept. Do you think that you will be interested in that?
Arundhati Bhattacharya: Definitely, we have to have some kinds of tie-ups. We are already doing a number of tie-ups for the BCs. For the corporate business correspondence, we have already tied up with a number of big corporates and, therefore, these mobile companies coming onboard are absolutely on the cards.
However, we still want to see the final guidelines regarding the payment banks. Over here, the regulator's requirement is that remittances and payments should become as simple as it can be made and the cash intensity has to come down. So everywhere, you need not have to take out cash in order to make small value payments. Now how do we get that right, how do we ensure that by the click of a button, you are able to send off money? It should be as simple as choosing your number from the contact list of your mobile.
When we are able to achieve that, there will be a proliferation of payments and for that we may not really need a payment bank. It may also be possible to do all of this without a payment banking structure merely by ensuring the link up of the mobile companies with the banks. So that is something that we are definitely looking at. We are trying to see how best this can be organised.
ET Now: There are reports that you are in talks with Airtel for BC model on payments bank. Are there some large telecom companies involved?

Japanese Muslim quizzed over plan to join Islamic State:reportsGermany announced last month to arm and train the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, who are battling IS militants in Iraq.
Press Trust of India | Tokyo | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:34 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:37 pm
Police are questioning a 26-year-old Japanese Muslim on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State jihadists in Syria, media reports and the top government spokesman said today. The man, a student at Hokkaido University, had reportedly planned to fly to the Middle East this week to fight with the Islamic extremist group, which has cut a swathe through Syria and Iraq.
The student told police he “was planning to travel to Syria so as to join Islamic State to work as a fighter”, the Mainichi Shimbun and other media reported. He hatched the plan after spotting a job advertisement posted at a second-hand bookshop in Tokyo.
The poster, which was shown on NHK, directed people interested in working in Syria to the shop clerk. It said a monthly wage of 15,000 RMB (around USD 2,400) was payable for people “not afraid of violence” to work alongside Uighurs in Syria.
Uighurs are the mainly-Muslim inhabitants of China’s northwest Xinjiang province. Beijing is facing mounting violence there, which it has blamed on separatists it says have been radicalized through contact with overseas-based terror groups. Most scholars remain sceptical of China’s claims, however, with some arguing that Beijing exaggerates the threat to justify its hardline measures in Xinjiang.
There have been no confirmed reports of Uighurs fighting alongside Islamic State in Syria or Iraq. No Chinese language ability was necessary, the advert said. There was no explanation of what the work entailed, or why the wage would be paid in the Chinese currency.
Hundreds of mostly young men have travelled from Europe and North America to join forces with the brutal group of jihadists, which has declared an Islamic “caliphate”. However, this is believed to be the first attempt by a Japanese. Japan has a tiny Muslim population, made up largely of relatively recent immigrants, and little history of home-grown religious extremism.
Detectives are also investigating the advertiser, the Yomiuri Shimbun said, without giving details of his or her identity. An employee at the bookstore was quoted as saying: “I introduced several people to a former university professor of Islamic law”. The academic denied advising anyone to join the jihadis, the Asahi Shimbun said, without identifying him or her.
The relationship between the bookstore and the advertiser was not immediately clear. A police spokesman declined to comment on the case.

After tweeting praise for Modi  Tharoor reminds him of bigotry and hatred inIndiaCongress leader Shashi Tharoor. (Source: Indian express)
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:22 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:23 pm
A day after Congress in Kerala mounted an attack on Shashi Tharoor on charges of joining hands with Narendra Modi for the cleaning campaign, the controversial party MP on Tuesday tweeted that the Prime Minister should work for an India cleansed of bigotry, hatred, intolerance and divisiveness, an India that is truly clean.
READ: Tharoor faces party ire for ‘praising’ Modi
The Congress in Kerala had attacked Tharoor for having accepted Modi’s invitation to join his Swacch Bharat campaign. As a sequel to the ongoing attack, party mouthpiece in Kerala on Tuesday indicated that the fortune hunter should be shown the door if he does not correct himself.
While reflecting the general sentiments of the Congress in Kerala, party daily Veekshanam has not mentioned the party spokesman’s name. But it has clear indications that the target of the attack is the party MP from Kerala capital.
The editorial said Narendra Modi’s American visit and cleaning drive on Gandhi Jayanti have exposed the true intention of certain foreign affairs experts. “It has to be doubted whether such persons in the crowd that is jostling to take membership in Modi fans association. It is better to have a decent exit from the home along with the paramour instead of keeping a secret relation with him through the backdoor.”

Tharoor has fallen into BJP’s trap, says Sudheeran
Senior leaders of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) will meet in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday to take a decision on the statements made by Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP, supporting some of the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Speaking to journalists here on Tuesday, the Kerala Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala said that the KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran, the Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and other leaders would take a decision on the issue.
However the former KPCC president did not divulge whether the party was mooting any disciplinary action against Mr. Tharoor. “ Mr. Tharoor has been praising Modi time and again. This was not suitable to Congress party. Ordinary Congress workers are severely disturbed by his statements, ” Mr. Chennithala said.
Replying to a query on an editorial that appeared in the Congress mouthpiece Veekshanam, ridiculing Mr. Tharoor, the Minister said that no Congress leader should propagate the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Sweyamsevak Sangh. “The polices of Narendra Modi should not be allowed in the country,” he added.
He also said that he stood by what the KPCC president said on the issue. Mr. Sudheeran had said Mr. Tharoor’s pro-Modi statements had been made without consultation with Congress high command and that Mr. Tharoor had fallen into BJP’s trap.
Already KPCC office bearers M.M. Hassan and V.D. Satheesan had come out against Mr. Tharoor. Some of them have sought disciplinary action against him. For quite some time, Congress leaders in Kerala have been rattled by Mr. Tharoor’s Twitter and Facebook comments supporting Mr. Modi. The latest provocation was that Mr. Tharoor accepting the Swachh Bharat Abhiyam challenge thrown at him by Narendra Modi.
However, an unfazed Tharoor has responded through his Twitter and Facebook accounts that the hue and cry made against him were baseless.

PM Modi hits back at MNS, claims Centre won't divide Maharashtra

Dhule: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday hit back at MNS chief Raj Thackeray and claimed that Centre has no plans of dividing Maharashtra. Modi called it a canard and said that Maharashtra would be incomplete without Mumbai. "After cotton and onion they started another lie saying Maharashtra will be divided! Can anyone do this? Is there anyone born who can divide Chhatrapati Shivaji's Maharashtra? Till I am in Delhi, I assure you no power will be able to break Maharashtra," Modi said.
MNS supremo had questioned why a prime minister was addressing more than 20 rallies for a state election. Raj Thackeray alleged that Modi wanted to gain control of India's financial capital.
While addressing a rally in Sindhkheda in Dhule district of Maharashtra on Tuesday Modi said Maharashtra is the state that has the capability to drive India's growth and Mumbai is central to that.
#narendra modi #pm modi #maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #maharashtra
Tearing into the Congress, Modi termed Modi the Congress-led government in Maharashtra a "murderer of farmers". "3700 farmers have committed suicide in one year in Maharashtra," Modi claimed.
Modi urged the people to punish the "murderers" of farmers in the October 15 Assembly elections. "Press on the lotus button on October 15 and make it the liberation day for the state from 15 years of Congress misrule," he said.
Modi said he does not need to go the house of a poor person to "snatch" his food for a photo opportunity as he himself came from a poor family.
"I had come amidst you during Lok Sabha campaign. I had requested you to trust me. You believed in what I said and elected BJP MPs from Dhule and Nandurbar," Modi said.
"Now, I have come to you again in four months. Politicians forget to fulfil poll promises. But I am not a politician. I am your sevak. I am the first servant of India," the 64-year-old leader said.
The Prime Minister said that when 60 months of "our regime will be complete, I will give account of every moment and every paisa. We made promises for development and we will keep them."

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was discharged from hospital on Monday after recovering from an infection that followed a stomach operation to treat diabetes, a doctor said.
"The minister is well. He has been treated for the ailments and has now been discharged," said Amit Gupta, senior surgeon and spokesman at the state-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi.
Jaitley, who also holds the defence portfolio, was moved to an isolation ward last month to reduce the number of people visiting him after he contracted the infection.
Despite his recovery, Jaitley may not be able to attend a World Bank meeting on October 10-12 in Washington, where he had been expected to hold a series of high-level meetings.
Gupta declined to comment on whether the 61-year-old minister would be able to travel any time soon.
Arun Jaitley also had to miss a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations in Australia last month after gastric bypass surgery to treat weight gain related to a long-standing diabetic condition.

Rajasthan: Two suspended after woman allegedly commits suicide in police stationSwaropganj SHO Ishwar Pareek and woman constable Tarawati were suspended and the rest of the staff in the police station were sent to police lines with immediate effect.
Express News Service | Jaipur | Posted: October 7, 2014 11:42 am
The custodial death of a 20-year-old woman in a police station in Sirohi Monday led to suspension of several police officials and a probe was initiated by the state government. Mamata, who was arrested in a murder case on Sunday, had gone to the washroom attended by two policewomen but allegedly committed suicide by strangulating herself with her dupatta.
The circumstances of the death were found dubious by the state women commission that has ordered a probe in addition to an inquiry initiated by the Sirohi district collector.
Swaropganj SHO Ishwar Pareek and woman constable Tarawati were suspended and the rest of the staff in the police station were sent to police lines with immediate effect. Sirohi Superintendent of Police Rajiv Pachar said, “The deceased was to be produced before a court on Monday for police custody while her brothers, Mukesh and Suresh, who too were arrested in the same murder case, were already sent to police remand. In the initial inquiry in the murder case, it was found that Mamata, a divorcee, was in a relationship with Ashok whom she eliminated along with her two brothers.”
State Women Commission chairperson Lad Kumari Jain said it was a suspected case of honour killing and that the commission doubted the sequence of events. Jain said that a team will be sent to Sirohi for fact finding and an independent probe into the incident.

Asian Shares Push Higher, Dollar Languishes
Reuters | Updated On: October 07, 2014 12:11 (IST)
Gold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
Tokyo: Asian shares rose on Tuesday, while the dollar languished after investors locked in some gains on its recent rally.
The lacklustre mood was seen spreading to Europe, where financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 to open 1 to 3 points higher, or up 0.05 points; Germany's DAX to open 35 points lower, or down 0.4 per cent; and France's CAC 40 to open 11 to 12 points lower, or down 0.3 per cent.
"European equities are set to edge lower tracking modest declines in the US overnight. The small negative start belies the huge amount of uncertainty in the markets at the moment," Capital Spreads dealer Jonathan Sudaria said in a note.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up about 0.3 per cent in late afternoon trade, after wobbling between positive and negative territory as it took its cues from a choppy, losing session on Wall Street overnight.
Japan's Nikkei stock average ended down 0.7 per cent, after the Bank of Japan offered a bleaker view on factory output. The BOJ maintained its massive asset buying programme, as widely expected.
The BOJ's policy meeting on Tuesday was interrupted because Governor Haruhiko Kuroda was summoned to speak in parliament, a rare event that last happened in September 1998.
Japanese stocks turned positive after Kuroda told a parliament committee meeting in the morning that a weak yen, as a whole, has a positive effect on Japan's economy if the currency's move reflects economic and market fundamentals.
"There were concerns about a negative impact of the weak yen on the economy as well, so his comment was assuring," said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities.
But Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Tuesday that a weaker yen burdens households and small firms by increasing fuel prices, and his comments pushed down the greenback.
The dollar gave up about 0.2 per cent to 108.62 yen, moving away from a six-year peak of 110.09 yen marked last week.
The euro fell 0.2 per cent on the day to $1.2624, heading back in the direction of a more than two-year low of $1.2501 set on Friday, after the US non-farm payrolls report fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates by mid-2015.
Currency investors had a muted reaction to Monday's disappointing report on German industrial orders, which fell 5.7 per cent in August to mark their biggest monthly drop since 2009. The data pressured euro zone bond yields and sent 10-year Bund yields close to record lows.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, narrowly slipped to 85.882 after marking its biggest one-day fall since July 2013 on Monday. The index rose to a four-year high of 86.746 on Friday, and logged a record 12 straight weeks of gains in which it rose about 7.7 per cent.
The Reserve Bank of Australia held its cash rate steady at 2.5 per cent at its regular policy review on Tuesday, and said that its currency remains high by historical standards.
The Australian dollar initially slipped after the announcement, but was up about 0.1 per cent at $0.8773 in late trading.
The dollar's weakness helped bolster recently slumping crude prices. Brent edged down about 0.1 per cent on the day to $92.70 a barrel.
Gold eased about 0.1 per cent to $1,204.66 an ounce. In a volatile session on Monday, it marked its biggest one-day gain in two months, after first bumping to a 15-month low.

Bank of Japan stands pat on policy  warns of weak factory outputBank of Japan stands pat on policy, warns of weak factory output
Reuters
No policy change expected, debate begins on new forecasts
Tokyo, Oct 7:  
The Bank of Japan on Tuesday maintained its massive asset buying programme but offered a bleaker view on factory output, following signs that the world's third-largest economy was hit harder than expected by a sales tax increase in April.
Policymakers stuck to their view that the economy will resume a moderate recovery and achieve the bank's 2 per cent inflation target next year without more monetary easing, but also acknowledged that weak consumer spending is hurting output and business sentiment.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda maintained that optimism earlier in the day, telling parliament that a positive economic cycle remained in place, with households and companies increasing spending as they see incomes rising.
Sales tax weighs
But he warned of potential risks to growth and stressed anew that the central bank was ready to ease monetary policy further if the economy and prices undershoot its forecast.
"It's true the effect (of the sales tax hike) on the economy is being prolonged. There's also the effect of bad summer weather," Kuroda told parliament.
The BOJ's policy meeting on Tuesday was interrupted because Kuroda was summoned to speak in parliament, a rare event that last happened in September 1998.
An intense burst of monetary and fiscal stimulus, which were the first two "arrows" of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's strategy to end 15 years of deflation, has helped boost business sentiment by lifting share prices and weakening the yen.
But his growth strategy to boost Japan's long-term economic potential, dubbed the third arrow of "Abenomics," has disappointed markets and, along with a spate of weak data, has cast doubts on the success of reviving the economy on a sustained basis.
"Japan's economy continues to recover moderately as a trend, but there is some weakness in production ... after the sales tax hike," the BOJ said in a statement after the meeting.
This was different from last month's statement, which said the economy "continues to increase moderately as a trend, although the effect of the April tax hike remains."
Markets will focus on Kuroda's assessment on risks to the outlook at his post-meeting briefing, as recent data suggest the economy may have entered a mild recession following the blow from the April sales tax hike to 8 per cent from 5 per cent.
The BOJ maintained its pledge of increasing base money, or cash and deposits at the central bank, at an annual pace of 60-70 trillion yen ($547-$638 billion) through purchases of government bonds and risky assets, as widely expected.
After a surprise slump in August factory output, the BOJ cut its assessment on production, saying output has been weak due partly to inventory adjustments. It said last month that the trend in output was for a continued rise, albeit with some weaknesses.
The fallout from the April sales tax increase has also led to a pause in improvement in business sentiment, the BOJ said.
Inflation expectations turning flat
BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai objected to the central bank's statement that inflation expectations are rising on the whole.
Instead, she proposed saying that more indicators show inflation expectations have turned flat recently, the statement showed.
Kuroda is likely to signal at his press conference that simply maintaining its stimulus will be sufficient to hit its inflation target, unless there are strong signs Japan will sink into prolonged recession, analysts say.
The central bank has stood pat on monetary policy since deploying an intense burst of stimulus in April last year, when it pledged to achieve its 2 per cent inflation in roughly two years via aggressive asset purchases.
Still, the central bank may come under renewed pressure to expand stimulus if the economic weakness persists, ahead of a decision expected from Abe by year-end on whether to proceed with another sales tax hike to 10 per cent in October 2015.
"The contraction in April-June economic growth was within expectations. The focus is on whether the economy will rebound strongly in the third quarter," Abe told parliament on Monday, when asked whether he will go ahead with the tax hike next year.
Debate at the two-day BOJ policy review, which concluded on Tuesday, will lay the groundwork for a more crucial policy meeting on Oct. 31, when the nine board members issue new quarterly long-term economic and price projections.
Given signs of a delay in the recovery, they are likely to roughly halve their economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year from the present projection of 1.0 per cent, the sources familiar with BOJ thinking said.
That would still be far more optimistic than a 0.3 per cent rise seen by analysts polled by Reuters.
But, the sources said, the BOJ is in no mood to cut its consumer inflation forecast yet, worried that doing so will give markets the impression it is not confident of meeting the target next year and heighten speculation of imminent monetary easing.

Jayas bail plea to come up for hearing in HCtodayPrint
The prosecution had come up with the case that over Rs 6 crore was spent for the marriage. (Source: PTI/file)
Written by Johnson T A | Bangalore | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:42 pm | Updated: October 8, 2014 11:31 am
A single judge of the Karnataka High Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea filed by former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa for grant of bail and suspension of her four-year prison term following her September 27 conviction in a Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case.
Dismissing the bail pleas filed by Jayalalithaa and three of her associates, Justice A V Chandrashekhar said the Supreme Court had in recent times taken a tough stand against corruption cases and had called “corruption a violation of human rights’’.
Although Special Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said he had no objections to bail being granted, the High Court bench referred to recent Supreme Court orders in corruption cases and ruled against Jayalalithaa’s plea. Initially, after Singh’s turnaround, word trickled out of the courtroom that Jayalalithaa had been granted bail, leading to celebrations by AIADMK supporters who had gathered outside.
“In view of the clear observation of the apex court that corruption is a violation of human rights, this is not a fit case for suspension and bail. Bail plea is liable to be dismissed,’’ said the court. It observed that there were no grounds to suspend her sentence. Though it is true that the sentence can be suspended in cases where it is seven years or less, it is not an absolute right, the court said.
The apex court has created a framework for addressing corruption cases in the course of the State of Maharashtra through CBI, Anti Corruption Branch, Mumbai Vs. Balakrishna Dattatrya Kumbhar case where it stated that “corruption is a serious malady affecting the health of the polity,’’ the bench observed.
The judge said Jayalalithaa’s case was not one without evidence, although there could be reason for argument on evidence that could be taken up at the stage of an appeal. The court cited a Supreme Court observation that conviction after a trial means a person is assumed to be corrupt till exonerated by a higher court.
A conviction by a sessions court is a disqualification against suspension of sentence since the court has applied its mind in the course of the trial, the bench said. The mere fact that the accused was on bail in the course of the 13-year trial of the case and did not violate bail conditions does not warrant a suspension of sentence and grant of bail, it said.
Senior advocate Ram Jethmalani, counsel for Jayalalithaa, said the special judge had committed several perversions in the trial and had proceeded in the case with the assumption that the prosecution had proved its case.
Senior advocate Amit Desai, appearing for V K Sasikala, said the special judge had “virtually reversed the first principles of jurisprudence’’ by putting the onus on the accused continued…

Mexico mass murder: Federal police take over Mexico city afterattacksA clandestine grave is seen in Iguala, Mexico, Monday, Oct. 6, 2014. State officials worked Monday to determine whether 28 bodies found in the clandestine graves are of the students who were attacked by local police in Iguala. (Source: AP)

Mexico sent federal agents to take over security in a troubled city in southern Guerrero state after the discovery of a mass grave and charges that local police conspired with a criminal gang to kill and disappear students.

The newly created preventative unit of the federal police was tasked Monday with keeping order in Iguala and helping search for the 43 students still missing following the Sept. 26 attack, in which six people died.

As state officials worked to determine whether any of the missing were among 28 bodies found over the weekend in a clandestine hillside grave, President Enrique Pena Nieto called the deaths “outrageous, painful and unacceptable.”
Pena Nieto said he dispatched federal security forces to “find out what happened and apply the full extent of the law to those responsible.”
Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco said so far there was no known motive for the attack, but officials have alleged that local police were in league with a gang called the Guerreros Unidos.

Investigators said video showed officers taking away an undetermined number of students, who had gone from a rural teachers college in Ayotzinapa to the city to solicit donations.
Speculation abounded among parents and local residents as a banner appeared in the name of the Guerreros Unidos. It demanded that 22 police officers detained in connection with the attack be released within 24 hours, and warned of consequences otherwise: “The war has started.”
The federal takeover came amid rising international concern over the Iguala incident and another possible case of a mass killing involving Mexican authorities.

Kolkata rickshaw-puller pedals his way toLadakhPress Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:58 pm
A rickshaw-puller from the city pedalled for two months and covered a 3,000-km arduous journey to reach distant Ladakh valley to become the first man to achieve the feat.
After riding his rickshaw for 68 days through Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Srinagar and Kargil, 44-year-old Satyen Das said he had crossed the famous Khardung La pass in Ladakh on August 17.
He returned home a few days ago and is now eyeing an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records for plying rickshaw at an altitude above of 5000 metres.
His trip was financed by the Naktala Agrani Club in south Kolkata.
The secretary of the club, Patho Dey, said, “We estimated that the trip would cost around Rs 80,000 which we raised from among club members. We were impressed by his passion and determination to undertake the adventure.”
“After I crossed Pathankot in Jammu and Kashmir, locals told me that they had never seen a rickshaw in their village,” Das said.
He said his journey was meant to promote rickshaw as a means of eco-friendly transport as well as to spread the message of world peace.
To record the feat, a documentary filmmaker from Kolkata accompanied him. He was also armed with maps to help him pick his way through.
This is not the first time Das undertook such a journey. Way back in 2008 he had gone all the way to Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh in a rickshaw with his wife and
daughter.
The best and the most challenging part of his journey was passing through an elevation of 17,582 feet at Khardung La pass which offers stunning views of the magnificent Himalayas.
As the road sloped upward, he had to get down from the rickshaw and pull it with hands through the rough mountainous terrain.
“It was very tiring and it took lot of time. But the view of natural beauty you get there makes you forget everything else in life,” Das said.
Proud moments during his journey were when locals and travellers stopped to click selfies with him and his rickshaw.
Das has many adventurous tales to recount on encountering wildlife during his trip including how he escaped a herd of wild elephants in Jhilmil forest near Haridwar and how he was petrified after seeing an Asian black bear standing near him while he was resting at night in his sleeping bag near Sonmarg.
Another scary moment was when he came face to face with the elusive snow leopard in Leh.
“Fortunately none of the animals attacked me,” the rickshaw ‘wallah’ said.
Marshalling his personal savings and generous donations from the local Naktala Agrani Club, he packed his luggage under the passenger’s seat and set off from his house on June 11.
He refurbished his rickshaw with an enhanced braking system, new tyres and a new body made of light steel.
Throughout his journey he pedalled to cover around 40-50 km every day and the night halts were in a religious place like temple or Gurudwara where he stayed safely for free of cost.
There were times when he couldn’t find any shelter and had continued…

Russia's Skolkovo Innovation Centre on a hunt in India to incubate startups in diverse areas
Peerzada Abrar & Krithika Krishnamurthy, ET Bureau Oct 8, 2014, 03.23AM IST

Dmitry Medvedev
((From left) Kirill Kaem,…)
BANGALORE: Russia's largest global technology hub, Skolkovo Innovation Centre , is on a hunt in India to incubate start-ups in areas such as big data analytics, biomedical devices and Internet of Things, a technology where devices communicate with each other intelligently. It is also looking to incubate companies in areas as diverse as energy management, space and nuclear technologies.
"I am not after dotcom or ecommerce. We are really trying to support the core technologies, especially in the space where venture capitalists are not interested," said Igor V Bogachev, vice-president and executive director IT cluster at Skolkovo Foundation, the principal agency responsible for the innovation centre."We want Indian innovators and technology entrepreneurs to partner directly with Russians."
Founded in 2010 and led by Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev , the foundation aims to develop and commercialise advanced technologies. With a $3.9-billion (about Rs24,000 crore) budget, three Nobel laureates, over 1,000 companies and start-ups, the Skolkovo Inplatforms Centre is Russia's largest supporter of innovation and a new global technology hub.
Bogachev said Indian companies can get grants between $50,000 and $10 million. The residents of the innovation space also get co-working space, financial and technical support. He conceded that Russians are great innovators but are poor marketers of technology, unlike the Silicon Valley . "The entrepreneurial system in India is much better.
The entrepreneurial history is too weak here," said Kirill Kaem, vicepresident and executive director of the BioMedical Cluster at Skolkovo. "We are trying to teach scientists to make money."
The companies in the Skolkovo cluster have also partnered with Indian firms to get their technology to the market here. Russia's Geolab, which sells technology for oil exploration, has signed up India's Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC). Another Russian firm C3D Labs is working with Indian company ProtoTech in the area of three dimensional modelling.
"We can get help from Russians for monitoring natural resources. Also, this initiative will open the door to Russian markets," said H Honne Gowda, technical director at Karnataka's Department of IT, BT, Science and Technology.
Skolkovo Foundation is spread over 400 hectare near Moscow. The city is complete with start-up incubators, residential areas, universities and research and development centres of large organisations like Cisco and Microsoft.
The Russian government provides the infrastructure and the rest is sustained by private money. Over the last three years, the facility has incubated companies which have yielded $600 million in revenue and created 15,000 jobs. The goal is to have over 30,000 innovators working and living in the area by 2020, said Bogachev. In 2012, Skolkovo gave a grant of $780,000 to a company called Workle, which created a service that people can use to start their own Internet-based careers.
Experts say India has become the go-to destination for overseas accelerators and incubators to provide mentoring and access to capital, given the rate at which start-ups are being founded across the country. These firms, with businesses ranging from personal healthcare services to specialised networking Inplatforms, are joining Singapore, Europe and the US-based accelerators that offer assured funding and links to a global customer base.
Since its entry into India in 2011, the US-based accelerator 500Startups has invested in at least 15 companies, including price comparison site Pricebaba and marketing firm Zipdial. In July, Scandid, a Pune-based shopping technology start-up, won the regional round of Seedstars World, a global start-up competition based in Geneva, Switzerland and supported by venture builder Seedstars.
Experts say Russia also wants to be a part of India's start-up and information technology boom other than the traditional aerospace and defence businesses. In April, Russian supercomputing company RSC group and the Russian Academy of Sciences proposed collaboration with India to set up supercomputing facilities that will rival China's Tianhe-2, the world's fastest supercomputer.
"Honestly speaking, we are not going to become the next Silicon Valley. We are trying to increase the share of innovation in our country," said Bogachev of Skolkovo Foundation. "We are pushing the system to switch later on. For the moment, we are running with government money."

India completes Global Entry Programme norms
New Delhi, October 5:  
Indians could soon find it easier to travel to the US.
This follows India agreeing to complete formalities to join the US Global Entry Programme. The decision to join the programme, which allows speedy clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travellers upon arrival in the US, was taken during the recent visit to the US of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Global Entry is a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) programme meant for the frequent traveller and there is no minimum number of trips to qualify for the programme. Participants in the programme can enter the US by using automated kiosks located at select airports, says the US Customs and Border Protection website.
“At airports, programme participants proceed to Global Entry kiosks, present their machine-readable passports or US permanent resident cards, place their fingertips on the scanner for fingerprint verification, and make a Customs declaration. The kiosk issues the traveller a transaction receipt and directs the traveller to baggage claim and the exit,” the website adds.
However, travellers have to be pre-approved for the Global Entry programme. All applicants have to undergo a rigorous background check and interview before enrollment, the website states. The programme is available at over 30 US airports including Chicago’s O'Hare, New York’s John F. Kennedy, Newark Liberty International Airport and San Francisco International Airport.
Senior Government officials said there was no time-frame yet for India to join the programme.
In 2011, the US Embassy and four consulates in India processed nearly 7,00,000 non-immigrant visas and more than 6,60,000 Indians travelled to the US in 2011.

Rupee seen weakening  yields might trade range-boundRupee seen weakening, yields might trade range-bound
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 06, 2014 12:25 AM IST
The rupee is expected to weaken this week as experts believe the dollar might continue to appreciate due to an increase in US economic growth. There are concerns in the currency market that the US Fed might start hiking interest rates sooner.
Data from last month showed the US economy expanded at a 4.6 per cent annualised rate in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 2011.
“The bias is towards the rupee weakening. The range for this week is 61-62. The rupee may near 62 but may not touch it. This is because the central bank may intervene and save the rupee,” said the head of treasury of a state-run bank.
The rupee ended at 61.61 on Wednesday compared with the previous close of 61.76 a dollar. The market was shut on Thursday and Friday.
Government bond yields, on the other hand, are seen trading range-bound this week. “The yield on the 10-year bond may continue to be stable in the range of 8.45-8.50 per cent,” said a bond trader with a state-run bank.
The 10-year bond yield ended at 8.48 per cent on Wednesday, compared with the previous close of 8.51 per cent. Meanwhile, the government borrowing programme for the second half of the financial year shall begin this week.

However, Indian banks, having earlier burnt their fingers on providing credit insurance for previous FCCB issuances, are very cautious. They have had the experience of having to pay for companies that had defaulted on bond payments.
Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has recently been in the market to raise $200 million through FCCBs. Many companies are in the process of getting their shareholders' approval for using this route to raise money.
A senior treasury executive at State Bank of India said FCCBs as an instrument gained prominence whenever equity markets perked and stayed that way. This time, though, public sector banks are going to be selective and thorough in structuring such deals.
FCCBs are bonds that can be converted into equity at maturity. If the share price of the issuer has fallen since the issue, the investor can ask, instead, for redemption of the bonds in cash. Deep Mukherjee, senior director, India Ratings, said FCCBs are an equity bull market instrument. Going by experience, in the first round it is large-size Indian companies with substantial business in international currencies which opt for this route and can also manage the repayment obligation.
During the bull run prior to the global financial crisis in 2008, many listed Indian companies raised large amounts through this route. The expectation was that investors would convert bonds into equity shares, as market prices ruled high. Faced with the downside of volatility after the global crisis happened, Indian stock markets also took a beating. The shares of companies which had issued FCCBs were trading at a huge discount to the conversion prices. The bond holders did not convert the instrument into equity shares. Hence, these companies were saddled with the liability to pay the principal amount and coupon on the maturity of the bonds, especially during 2011-2013. Many of them did not have the resources to make repayments.
In 2011, the Reserve Bank of India in its Financial Stability Report had flagged the risk from problems faced in servicing FCCBs. Some were able to renegotiate for more time and raise resources to pay investors. Some had defaulted on payment and the debt service obligations fell on banks, which had issued credit-linked notes, a type of credit insurance.
According to a trader at the convertible market in London, it will take some time for the market to pick up, particularly for mid-cap issuers. The first signs of recovery would happen, he said, with large-cap companies. Investors were, he said, not looking at present for Indian issues due to the recent experience of defaults. Currently, investors want better pricing, which companies like L&T are not offering. In six to 12 months. "We can hope for some recovery in this market for Indian issuers," he said. Investors want a small difference between the conversion and market price.
Mukherjee said large companies can repay FCCBs. It is the tier-I and tier-II companies, some wet importers, which are at risk.
They have limited ability to service repayment for the principal if the bonds are not converted into equity. When Indian companies with such a profile look for raising funds through FCCBs, prospective investors will look for credit insurance from Indian banks.

DoT may retain old base price for next 2G auctionDoT may retain old base price for next 2G spectrum auction
Sanjay Singh     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 11:11 IST
Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad (Photo: Reuters)
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is looking at benchmarking the spectrum price for the next 2G spectrum auction to the February 2014 base price instead of the discovered price which is much higher.
According to the sources, the proposal is under consideration as otherwise the reserve price, for the auction scheduled for February 2015 would get pushed up too high and could result in a tepid response from telcos as had happened earlier.
Top DoT officials said the proposal worked out earlier, where the new discovered price would be the base price for next round of spectrum auctions cannot be sacrosanct.
"We would need to work it out as telcos had bid almost 27 per cent higher than the base price of the spectrum during the last auction in February 2014. Let Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) first come out with its price recommendations. We don't expect much increase in the base price as telecom industry is not in very good shape," said an official requesting anonymity. The government plans to auction 184 MHz of 900 MHz band and 104 MHz in 1800 Mhz band of spectrum in the upcoming auction.
Trai is expected to come out with its recommendations on new base price of 900 and 1800 MHz for February 2015 auctions later this month. The auction will be across 18 out of the 22 telecom circles. During the last auction of 900 MHz band and 1800 Mhz band of spectrum in February 2014, the government had received total bids worth Rs 61,092 crore, which is about 27 per cent more than the base price valued at Rs 47,934 crore.
While Trai in September 2013 recommended a sharp 60 per cent and 37 per cent cut in base price of 900 and 1800 MHz spectrum bands respectively, the EGoM in November 2013 had increased the base price of the two spectrum bands by 25 per cent for the February 2014 auction.

Public investment really is a free lunchOctober 6, 2014 2:12 pm
Why public investment really is a free lunch
By Lawrence Summers
©AFP
It has been joked that the letters IMF stand for “it’s mostly fiscal”. The International Monetary Fund has long been a stalwart advocate of austerity as the route out of financial crisis, and every year it chastises dozens of countries for their fiscal indiscipline. Fiscal consolidation – a euphemism for cuts to government spending – is a staple of the fund’s rescue programmes. A year ago the IMF was suggesting that the US had a fiscal gap of as much as 10 per cent of gross domestic product.
The FT’s A-List
The A-List provides timely, insightful comment on the topics that matter, from globally renowned leaders, policy makers and commentators
All of this makes the IMF’s recently published World Economic Outlook a remarkable and important document. In its flagship publication, the IMF advocates substantially increased public infrastructure investment, and not just in the US but much of the world. It asserts that when unemployment is high, as it is in much of the industrialised world, the stimulative impact will be greater if investment is paid for by borrowing, rather than cutting other spending or raising taxes. Most notably, the IMF asserts that properly designed infrastructure investment will reduce rather than increase government debt burdens. Public infrastructure investments can pay for themselves.
Why does the IMF reach these conclusions? Consider a hypothetical investment in a new highway financed entirely with debt. Assume – counterfactually and conservatively – that the process of building the highway provides no stimulative benefit. Further assume that the investment earns only a 6 per cent real return, also a very conservative assumption given widely accepted estimates of the benefits of public investment. Then, annual tax collections adjusted for inflation would increase by 1.5 per cent of the amount invested, since the government claims about 25 cents out of every additional dollar of income. Real interest costs, that is interest costs less inflation, are below 1 per cent in the US and much of the industrialised world over horizons of up to 30 years. So infrastructure investment actually makes it possible to reduce burdens on future generations.
In fact, this calculation understates the positive budgetary impact of well-designed infrastructure investment, as the IMF recognised. It neglects the tax revenue that comes from the stimulative benefit of putting people to work constructing infrastructure, as well as the possible long-run benefits that come from combating recession. It neglects the reality that deferring infrastructure renewal places a burden on future generations just as surely as does government borrowing.

Mumbai, Oct 6:  
The Union Minister, Nitin Gadkari has courted a controversy asking journalists to “keep the packages (money) they get during the election season”.
“In the next 10-12 days, you journalists will have ‘Laxmi darshan’,” Gadkari said at a poll rally in Sawantwadi in coastal Konkan on Saturday.
“Be it reporters or editors, there are separate packages for reporters, newspapers and their owners,” Gadkari said.
“Diwali has come. I have one request, keep whatever you get. Eat whatever you can,” he said.
The state secretariat and legislature journalists association flayed Gadkari’s remarks.
“Gadkari’s comments are highly objectionable,” president of Mantralaya Vidhimandal Vartahar Sangh, Pravin Puro said here.
“Gadkari has said journalists accept ‘packages’ (for election coverage). Due to such statements, the image of journalists gets dented,” Puro said.

Waldorf Astoria sold to Chinese companyWaldorf Astoria sold to Chinese company for $1.95 billion
By Ben Rooney   @ben_rooney October 6, 2014: 3:21 PM ET
The Waldorf Astoria has been a symbol of luxury for decades.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The Waldorf Astoria in New York is being sold to a Chinese insurance company for $1.95 billion.
Conrad N. Hilton acquired the iconic luxury hotel 65 years ago and on Monday Hilton Worldwide ( HLT ) announced its sale to Anbang Insurance Group. Hilton will continue to operate the Waldorf for the next 100 years under a "strategic partnership" with the Beijing-based company.
The Waldorf Astoria will undergo a "major renovation" to restore the hotel to its "historic grandeur," according to a joint statement from Hilton and Anbang.

The Waldorf Astoria is the flagship of Hilton's 27 luxury hotels around the world.
It first opened in 1893 on the site of millionaire William Waldorf Astor's Fifth Avenue mansion. Waldorf's cousin and fellow millionaire John Jacob Astor IV reconstructed the hotel a few years later at a nearby location. The hotel fell into disrepair during prohibition and was torn down in 1929, making way for another landmark: the Empire State Building.
The Waldorf is a cultural icon and has hosted foreign heads of state for years. It was featured in a 1945 film staring Ginger Rogers called "Week-end at the Waldorf."
Legend has it that the Waldorf salad was invented by the maître d'hôtel of the Waldorf Astoria in 1896.
The hotel is home to restaurants where New York's elite dine such as Peacock Alley, Bull and Bear Prime Steakhouse and Oscar's.

The Waldorf Astoria has been at its current location on Park Avenue since 1931.
Hilton plans to open nine more swanky hotels globally in locations that range from Bali and Bangkok to Beverly Hills. The company said it will use the proceeds from the Waldorf sale to fund future purchases.

Fast-food deals roll out for fall

Burger King chicken nuggets

Fall fast-food deals are rolling out like so many pumpkins.
With summer in the rearview mirror and the weather cooling off, many consumers choose eating options beyond the fast-food joint. So, the major fast-food chains are offering special deals and limited-time promos to try to keep the customers from leaving, or to lure them back for more.
On Monday, Burger King announces one of the highest-profile deals of the fall when, for a limited time, it rolls back the price of its 10-piece Chicken Nuggets pack to $1.49, about half the usual price of $2.99.
"We wanted to offer our guests an aggressive deal rivaling anything our competition has ever done," said Eric Hirschhorn, chief marketing officer, North America, in a statement.
Beyond Burger King, everyone from McDonald's to Taco Bell to KFC to Dairy Queen to Pizza Hut has a special deal or promo in motion.
For most of the fast-food giants, it's a market-share battle in an industry struggling for growth.  Under that scenario, the easiest way to instantly attract business is by discounting.
"Discounting is generally driven by the desire to get ... customers" to try new things, says Sam Oches, editor of QSR Magazine, a fast-food industry trade publication.   But watch out, he warns. While value deals can drive traffic, discounting comes at a cost and often teaches consumers to wait for discounts before going out to eat. "Franchisees especially are wary of too much discounting," he says.
But customers can't get enough of it. Beyond the nuggets promotion at BK, here are some of this month's other fast-food deals:
• McDonald's.  A 20-piece pack of Chicken McNuggets goes for $5 — a price considerably higher than BK's new nugget deal.  But McDonald's also just rolled out its annual Monopoly promotion and sweepstakes, which is a huge attraction with substantial prizes.
• Taco Bell. Its relatively new Dollar Cravings Menu offers products that actually cost $1, not more, like its Beefy Fritos Burrito and the Shredded Chicken Mini-Quesadilla.
• KFC. The brand's $5 Fill-Ups menu promises lots of food for little dough.  One such offer includes a drumstick and thigh, biscuit, medium soft drink and a chocolate chip cookie for $5.
• Dairy Queen. The 5 Buck Lunch keeps getting new iterations.  The latest is two Crispy Chicken Wraps, fries, a soft drink and a sundae for $5.
• Pizza Hut. To promote online ordering, the chain has been offering a $7.99 "Digital Deal" on a large, two-topping pizza ordered online.
Still not satisfied?  Well, the very best fast-food deals typically come just after the first of the year, when credit cards often are maxed out on holiday shopping and twofers become more common.  But the big chains are betting you won't be able to hold out that long — or will you?

For a new law against racismFor a new law against racism
Tomojit Basu
North Easterners, Africans particularly vulnerable
October 6, 2014:  
YouTube footage of three African students being set upon by a large, armed mob shouting ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ at a Delhi metro station was odious for anyone who takes pride in India’s socio-cultural diversity.
The Bezbaruah Committee (BC), instituted after the death of Nido Taniam earlier this year, highlighted troubling numbers in its report. For instance, some 86 per cent of 15,000 migrants from the North-East in the capital over the last three years have felt racially discriminated against. Hence, the case for a holistic anti-racism law is worth revisiting.
Laws lay the framework for a civilised society by setting boundaries for individuals. Fresh legislation, even if it doesn’t promote immediate deterrence, would arm inclined lawyers with an important tool to seek justice.Existing equality legislation, in the form of Articles 15 and 371 and the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989), isn’t sufficient to tackle race crimes. The legal shortcomings were highlighted by Avani Chokshi in ‘The Racism Quandary’, an article published in NUJS’s Journal of Indian Law & Society last month.
An advisory panel for the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, set up by the previous NDA-regime, had recommended additions to Article 14 and 15 as part of the ‘Enlargement of Fundamental Rights’ and amending the defined ‘heads’ to include ‘ethnic and social origin’ and ‘colour’.
A comprehensive law would overcome existing lacunae. For instance, in 2011, the Ministry of Home Affairs had directed those guilty of uttering racial slurs to be prosecuted under the SC/ST Act, with a sentence of up to five years. . Many aren’t, however, a point brought up by the Bezbaruah Committee.
New legislation might not mitigate racism but it will certainly provide victims with a specific means of legal redressal. Development should encompass cultural tolerance and social accommodation as much as economic growth. Inclusive education to dispel stereotypes about cultures and regions is a long-term exercise. In the interim, a sweeping anti-racism law might ensure the well-being of an African guest standing next to Indian citizens on the train.

All you wanted to know about: Drone deliveriesA weekly column that puts the fun into learning
October 6, 2014:  
Until now, Drones were only used to deliver misery to militants in the hiding by dropping bombs on them. But some companies have discovered a more peaceful use for that tiny helicopter-like vehicle – delivering parcels to us lawful denizens. Ever since the largest online retailer Amazon announced last year that it plans to deliver packages through unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, there has been considerable interest in them, with online shoppers looking forward to their purchases being air-dropped at their doorstep (or rooftop) in style.
When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently visited India, he was besieged by questions on whether India, and not the US, would be the first test market for drone deliveries. But express service provider DHL has already beaten Amazon in the game as it is set to deliver parcels to an island through a ‘parcelcopter’. Google has reportedly been doing test flights for the past couple of years in Australia.
What is it?
Octocopters or pacelcopters or paketkopters are small flying vehicles that operate without human intervention. They are expected to be battery-operated with battery lives of at least 30-45 minutes. These devices are expected to carry items that weigh about 2.3 kilos and the delivery radius is expected to be about 16 kilometers, according to Bezos. The parcel is expected to be delivered within 30 minutes. Incidentally, 86 per cent of Amazon’s parcels fall into this 2.3 kilo bracket.
Why is it important?
Drone deliveries seem very sci-fi today. But they may end up solving quite a few logistics problems. For instance, DHL plans to launch a pilot project for paketkopter deliveries in four to six weeks, through which it plans to deliver medication and other necessary goods to Wadden Sea Islands, Germany. The kopter would fly for 45 minutes to reach its destination. From there a local courier company would pick up the parcel and deliver it to customers. The DHL paketkopters can carry parcels weighing only up to 1.2 kilos.
Google has been testing drone delivery of radios, dog treats and cattle vaccines in Queensland, Australia for a two years now.
Why should I care?
Given the roadblocks and potholes in many Indian cities and the snail-paced traffic, wouldn’t flying things around in drones be a nifty way to sort out all the logistics problems? Both companies and customers can gain much from the time saved. Imagine how well this would work in emergency situations. But even if it sounds a great idea, getting from theory to practice may take quite some doing.
For one there are safety issues. Aerial deliveries in most countries will be subject to a whole host of approvals. The aviation authorities in the respective countries need to give their stamp of approval. The US aviation authority FAA has not allowed any unmanned aerial vehicles to deliver parcels as yet. It has indicated that until a set of rules are framed for drones, it would not allow these vehicles to crowd its air space. Bezos has hinted the technology aspect of the drone isn’t really the challenge. It is the regulatory aspect that may take time. Some reports peg the timeline to be not earlier than five years from now.
The bottomline
The idea of getting smartphone which you ordered dropped in through your bedroom window may sound appealing. But what technology proposes, the regulators may easily dispose.

The importance of labour statisticsThe importance of labour statistics
STEFAN BENDER / JORG HEINING /KAUSHIK KRISHNAN
Tweet
Frame is in place The rest will follow
Hard data on what works will lead to greater stability in India’s labour policies, and a move away from informalisation
India’s unemployment rate currently sits at 9 per cent. Yet, one in three citizens with at least a bachelor’s degree is out of work. Its working age population is projected to rise from over 750 million today to almost a billion by 2020. At the same time, agricultural employment is in decline, accounting for less than 50 per cent of total employment for the first time in Indian history. These market pressures are pushing the labour force towards higher skilled occupations. Yet, even young, college-educated Indians often lack the requisite skills to obtain these jobs.
It is perhaps with this transition in mind that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced Skill India, a programme to give young workers the training needed to find jobs. The goal is to train 500 million workers by 2022. An existing organisation, the National Skill Development Corporation, as well as 18 other ministries, have run skill development programmes in the past. Skill India aims to consolidate and replace these fragmented initiatives. However, the Government needs not only to upgrade its programmes but also its data collection and evaluation systems.
The German example
The argument for high-quality accessible data is that, regardless of ideology, governments should pursue effective policies. Additionally, even well-intentioned policies can have perverse effects. Data-driven analysis is needed for both. For example, recent research shows that India’s child labour ban led to an increase in child labourers and a decrease in their wages.
At present, the National Sample Survey is the only source of nationally representative labour market data. At best, it can uncover some broad trends in employment levels. Given India’s large labour force and many state-sponsored initiatives, a richer employee-employer benefit-linked data set is needed for meaningful policy evaluation. Other countries have made considerable progress in this regard.
Fifteen years ago in Germany, a push from researchers and the strong will of the administration led to the creation of a unique database on individual workers by the Federal Employment Agency. The data originate from notifications into the social security system and employees’ basic information on employment — a rich set of socio-demographic characteristics of the employee and some information on the employing establishment — are put together and annually submitted. Using unique social security numbers, information on employment is combined with other data such as periods of unemployment benefits, registered job-searches, and participation in programmes and training schemes.
Widely used
The resulting database allows researchers and policymakers to follow workers from the beginning of their training until they leave the labour force and enter the pension system. As a consequence, almost all active labour market programmes in Germany are evaluated using these data. Prominent examples include the evaluation of the so-called “Hartz reforms,” major labour market reforms in 2005 where new payment schemes for unemployment benefits were introduced and the recently introduced comprehensive minimum wage.
Most of this evaluation comes at a very low cost to the government. Resources like the German employee-employer matched data have become the gold standard for high quality, academic research in labour economics, as the data are publicly accessible for research while preserving confidentiality. Rules are in place to ensure that the privacy of any single individual in the database is maintained.
The Federal Employment Agency has a Research Data Centre, a facility specifically designed to provide researchers with access to confidential micro data in a secure environment in compliance with privacy laws. Several field offices of the German RDC have opened in the US, making this data available for analysis to academic researchers.
India’s head start
India does not have to start from scratch to create a similar data set. In fact, most of the raw data needed are already collected. Many industries have to report employee wages to comply with Employee Provident Fund and Employee State Insurance laws. Individuals are required to report income in their tax returns. Almost all benefit programmes in India collect and maintain their own data. The only thing remaining is to link and clean the data originating from different sources.
It might be argued that the creation of this data set is pointless as most of India’s labour force is informal or contract-based. However, the same problems plague any data collection effort, including the NSSO’s. On the contrary, there are many big picture benefits. Hard data on what works will lead to greater stability in India’s labour policies. The knowledge we glean can be used in fixing India’s labour laws to encourage greater formal participation. Better data leads to more efficient investment by the Government as well as outside agencies. Most importantly, the costliest part of this endeavour, collecting the raw data, is already being done.
The lesson from the German experience is clear: preparing data is not a bureaucratic burden nor is it prohibitively expensive. Creating, maintaining, and allowing access to administrative data will encourage high quality research on the Indian labour market. The benefits to policymakers and the Indian public are clear. Effective interventions can only happen by chance unless India invests in systems that help it understand how its labour markets operate.

Where have all the water bodies goneWhere have all the water bodies gone?
A Narayanamoorthy / P Alli
THE HINDU When will we ever learn The excesses of urbanisation G KRISHNASWAMY
Recent court rulings have taken exception to encroachments, but governments need to get their act together
On September 6, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court gave a landmark ruling directing the Government not to grant layout approval or building plan permission on lands located on water bodies. It was responding to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on the subject.
This historic judgment is not only a wake-up call for Tamil Nadu, but for other States as well where a significant number of small water bodies are dying.
The judgment comes close on the heels of the Delhi High Court’s grave remark that the depleting water level will lead to water wars soon.
Earlier, in 2013, the Supreme Court directed authorities in Kanpur Dehat District to check encroachments on the water bodies in their jurisdiction. The Rajasthan High Court in 2012 also came down heavily on the State government over the illegal allotments and encroachments in the catchment area of water bodies.
Traditional water bodies (mainly tanks) generate innumerable benefits to the farmers and society. It is a low cost source of irrigation and also predominantly managed by the farmers themselves. The command area of most tanks is small and therefore, the problems associated with irrigation management are less. Being a less capital-intensive source of irrigation, tank irrigation is considered to be user-friendly with fewer environmental problems.
Tanks help capture, conserve and store what little rainfall the region receives. They help recharge groundwater aquifers which are stable and reliable source of irrigation for millions of farmers. In years of high rainfall tanks do provide some protection against risk of floods by allowing surplus rainwater flow into it. In years of low rainfall, the stored water in tanks provides some protective irrigation as well. Should we sit back and watch the alarming destruction of these natural reservoirs?
Many initiatives have been taken over the years to protect and sustain small water bodies in India. In his Budget for 2004-05, former finance minister P Chidambaram proposed launching a massive scheme to repair, renovate and restore (RRR) all water bodies that are directly linked to agriculture.
Following that announcement, during the Tenth Five Year Plan, the Government of India launched a pilot scheme for RRR of water bodies. The Eleventh Plan saw an enhanced allocation of funds towards this scheme.
The Ministry of Environment and Forests has been implementing the centrally sponsored scheme of National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) since June 2001. This scheme also received substantial funds during the Eleventh Plan. The Twelfth Plan, too, accorded high priority to watershed restoration, groundwater recharge and groundwater law to tackle groundwater related problems.
Sorry state of affairs
But urbanisation over the years has turned these community resources to dumping grounds. The Standing Committee on Water Resources (2012-13) on “Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies” underlined in its 16th report that most of the water bodies in the country were encroached upon by municipalities and panchayats. How do these civic bodies remain silent to encroachments?
Uttar Pradesh has reportedly lost more than one lakh water bodies to the hands of illegal encroachments within a year.
The Centre for Science and Environment reports that out of about 1012 water bodies in Delhi, about 70 are under partial and about 98 are under total encroachment. Encroachments severely reduce the water holding capacity of the natural reservoirs. This results in outflow of water during monsoon, leading to widespread floods.
The Standing Committee on Water Resources (2012-13) also highlighted that out of 5.56 lakh tanks in the country, only 4.71 lakh tanks are in use. This effectively implies a loss of about one million hectares of irrigation potential. Tanks irrigated more than 50 per cent of the agriculture lands in many States in India until 1950s.
However, with the introduction of Green Revolution during the sixties, the area irrigated by tanks fell from 4.63 million hectares (mha) in 1960-61 to 2.04 mha in 2010-11.
The scenario in water starved Tamil Nadu which is home to about 41,127 tanks is just as gloomy; its area under tank irrigation declined gradually from about 9.36 lakh hectares in 1960-61 to 5.28 lakh hectares in 2011-12. Are water users aware that if tanks continue to be neglected, the recharge mechanism will come to a halt? Even wells will cease to have water and diesel and electric powered pumps will be rendered useless. Isn’t this a fine example of ‘Tragedy of the Commons’, wherein everybody chases short-term wealth at the cost of destroying their long-term collective asset?
Some pointers
Recently, farmers across the country are bemoaning the escalatiWon in overall cost of cultivation brought about mechanised pumping. While the Central Groundwater Board estimated that out of the total 5,824 blocks in India, 1494 are either semi-critical or over-exploited; most wells in certain parts of the country have reportedly gone bone dry.
Policymakers have come to realise that water bodies need to be repaired, restored and renovated.
It is high time that the government realises the gravity of the situation by setting up a separate ministry for small water bodies with adequate funding to conduct periodic repairs. A new legislation should be urgently enacted to make encroachment on water bodies a cognisable offence.
As suggested by the Nobel Laureate Ellinor Ostrom, to avoid a tragedy of depletion, individuals should be entitled to use and run the common property resource, and set clear boundaries to keep out those who aren’t entitled. Farmers voluntarily must come forward to organise themselves into tank users’ organisations which will enable them to undertake repairing of tanks under State sponsored programmes.
This can lead to the revival of the traditional method of community maintenance namely Kudimaramathu. In order to rekindle the sense of responsibility towards preserving the common property resource, the State can also reward the best managed tanks in a locality.
'While the Jal Marg Vikas project is aimed at reviving the country’s inland water bodies, a similar effort should be made with respect to small water bodies. Observing ‘Small Water Bodies’ Day’ along the lines of World Water Day will make all stakeholders aware of the far reaching benefits of tanks, and save our age old oases.

Our schools are just getting smarterOur schools are just getting smarter
Shantanu Prakash
Joy of learning That's coming back M Periasamy
Digital tools are found to enhance teachers’ performance and enliven the classroom experience
Education has remained, from time immemorial, the basis of all change, development and progress, whether societal or individual. It is, therefore, interesting to see that education itself is being enveloped by change, as the digital revolution re-engineers almost every aspect of it, from content to delivery to evaluation.
Globally, education is unrecognisable from its earlier avatar except in the fundamental dynamics of the teaching-learning process. That too, some would argue, has undergone a transformation so dramatic that teaching and learning are no longer what they used to be and a new set of variables are dictating the mechanics of this relationship.
The IT-enabled ecosystem with its attendant features such as the digital classroom, content-on-demand, interactivity, dynamic progress mapping and new metrics of evaluation have transformed it into a digitalised, modern concept where outcomes matter most.
Century old notions of education are breaking down in favour of a system that is rebuilt from ground up to include a technology platform that ensures individual learning, creativity and collaboration at every stage of the education ecosystem.
New paradigms
The typical classroom which was once characterised by boring hour-long sessions, has now transformed into an interesting, challenging, multimedia environment. Projector screens are the new blackboards and content is designed to impact, engage and interest, holding attention, easing comprehension.
Learning has become seamless and students have become more attentive to the subject on the plasma screen or the interactive whiteboard. At the same time, teaching has morphed into a strategic management task. Technology has freed teachers from rote-based teaching and allowed them to focus on managing student performance, and aiding, mentoring and monitoring progress. It has also allowed teachers to provide individualised instruction based on student needs.
Technology-aided education not only provides schools a potential mechanism to improve outcomes, but also radically transforms the teacher-student-parent collaboration model.
Ideas like the Integrated Learning System (ILS) — an IT-based education programme that controls the delivery of the curriculum, provides inclusive feedback to the learner and assists teachers to meet the challenges of delivering high quality instruction — will define this new order. ILS is a means to improve students’ academic performance and teachers’ productivity in classroom with simple, practical and meaningful use of technology.
ILS includes the use of various apps which help in increasing the student’s attentiveness and participation. The primary advantage of ILS remains the potential to respond to the needs of individual learners. Through ILS, the curriculum can be tailored to meet the academic objectives of the students who, being quick adopters of technology, get a better understanding of curriculum, concepts and visual learning strategies.
Easy passage
With over 50 per cent of students today using a smart phone device or connected to the internet, it is no surprise that students are taking to learning through technology like duck to water.
Today, the digital classroom experience is metamorphosing into a new, integrated technology architecture that helps schools in enhancing the quality of learning and increasing learning outcomes by extrapolating the positive experiences of the smart class.
The key drivers of this transformation are modern, pioneering ideas like the SmartSchool concept. SmartSchool looks at the school as an integrated learning ecosystem, where layers of technology interventions at various delivery points create a 360 degree education experience that encompasses content, delivery, access and assessment.
SmartSchool provides never-seen-before features, allowing schools to integrate, create and enhance a 360 degree relationship with all stakeholders while keeping the student at the centre of the learning experience.
India has had the unusual advantage of being relatively in step with global trends in digital education, at least as far as urban centres go. The internet is freeing up learning like never before.
Time, space, distance, geography, faculty are no longer a limitation and anyone, anywhere can acquire any quality of education any time. In a shift such as this, it becomes necessary for education policy drivers to provide enabling administrative and regulatory mechanisms so that the millions of our young students can get the best the world has to offer.

Marketers split on e-comm ad warMarketers split on e-comm ad war
Sangeetha Chengappa 
Battle unsustainable in the long term, say marketing experts
Bangalore, October 6:  
The face-off between the country’s e-commerce titans — Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal — which began early Monday morning with Flipkart’s ‘The Big Billion Day’ sale, signals the start of a marketing war that is set to intensify in the months to come.
However, brand gurus and marketing consultants say the kind of advertising blitz by Flipkart in the run-up to the sale, which was countered by Snapdeal and Amazon on TV, print, billboards and so on, cannot be sustained in the long run.
No value for money
“The kind of advertising money spent by Flipkart to promote The Big Billion Day sale is not value for money for the company,” says Sridhar Ramanujam, brand guru, author and founder CEO of Brand-comm. “From the marketing perspective, advertising money is spent by companies after clearly determining the sales that it will bring in. In this instance, Flipkart is not making any money given the huge discounts (25-60 per cent) it is offering. By outspending the competition, Flipkart is looking for disproportionate customer mindshare and is out to grab eyeballs with a massive show of one-upmanship. It is not sustainable in the long run.”
Agreeing with Ramanujam, Raghu Viswanath, Managing Director of brand value advisory firm, Vertebrand, says that this kind of advertising spend by Flipkart is all about flexing its muscle power, especially after acquiring Myntra.com and receiving a fresh round of funding recently. “The intense hype created around the sale almost a month in advance is a way of urging new customers who have never transacted online before to log in and avail themselves of great discounts.”
He warned however, that changing the purchase behaviour of customers from offline to online cannot be achieved with a one-day sale as it is a slow process. “It’s a game of aggregation and consolidation that Flipkart is playing to emerge as the last man standing, where companies with deep pockets will survive and buy out or wipe out the others” he said.
‘A good strategy’
Speaking to BusinessLine, Jessie Paul, CEO of Paul Writer Strategic Advisory, a marketing advisory firm, said: “When you blast customers at this level, like Flipkart did, they feel the urge to check out the sale and not feel left out. Even the older generation ends up asking their children, nephews, nieces to buy merchandise at great deals on their behalf.
“Although Flipkart is making losses with every item sold in its one-day sale, it is building up its market share by attracting new customers. Once they gain market share, they will hike prices to make every sale profitable” she said.
Choosing to focus their energies on getting customers to spend on one day by offering fantastic deals and discounts and building up the momentum to that day is a great way to gain customer share of voice, says brand consultant, Harish Bijoor. “Many customers may be disappointed at items getting stocked out in seconds and the site crashing now and then, but that is good for Flipkart because the next time they announce a sale, they will have customers queuing up” he said.

Hewlett-Packard spinoff likely to hit Mphasis outsourcing bizHewlett-Packard spinoff likely to hit Mphasis outsourcing biz
Venkatesh Ganesh/Adith Charlie
Tweet
Bangalore/Mumbai, October 6:  
HP’s decision to split its business could further impact Mphasis outsourcing business and lock horns with the technology giant in some business areas.
On Monday, HP said that it will split its business into two businesses. The first would be HP Enterprise, which will sell servers, networking, storage equipment and the second is HP Inc, which will sell PCs and printers. Mphasis is a part of HP and gets around 36 per cent of its revenues at the end of first quarter of 2015 fiscal, which could further go down in this fiscal.
Analysts believe that this decision would further impact Mphasis business that is coming from HP.
According to Sanchit Vir Gogia, Chief Analyst & Chief Executive Officer of Greyhound Research, with this move, one expects HP to capitalise on its own services portfolio and compete head on with Mphasis in the marketplace.
Mphasis officials point out that in such a scenario, the company is preparing to look at revenues coming from non-HP business.
“While it is too early to take a concrete decision, we are deliberating this internally,” said a source in Mphasis who is not authorised to speak to the press. When contacted, an Mphasis spokesperson did not comment.
Mphasis has been consciously changing its business model and trying to rev up its growth engines by trying to move away from business that it gets from HP to that of competing on its own in by making acquisitions such as Digital Risk into areas such as mortgage-related software. It also launched a new brand identity with a focus on bagging next generation software services contracts in areas such as digital technologies and wearable computing.
“The company’s effort to reposition itself clearly is a way to delink itself from its parent in due course of time,” according to AK Prabhakar, IT analyst.

Pawar family faces a tough fight in its traditional bastionPawar family faces a tough fight in its traditional bastion

Baramati voters may opt for a change to boost development in the region
Baramati, October 6:  
Vinod More, a 20-year-old budding volley player, is panting after three rounds of jogging at a massive ground near Vidya Pratisthan, the educational super complex created by Sharad Pawar and his family in Baramati, western Maharashtra.
Although the Pawar family has created educational institutions, there is no guarantee that he will get a good job in Maharashtra, said More, who has enrolled for a degree course in biotechnology at one of the colleges run by Vidya Pratisthan. He added ruefully that he will probably have to relocate to cities such as Bangalore, which will pay him good money but force him to move away from his ailing mother.
In 15 years of Congress-NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) rule, Pawar has had a free hand in the State, noted More. But there has been little rise in skilled jobs or industrial development.
Maharashtra was an early pioneer, with institutions such as Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and Haffkine Institute, but over the years it has lost its edge in biological sciences, More said.
More's team mate Anand Patil, who is pursuing engineering at a local college, said that even local residents of Baramati are disenchanted with local MLA and former Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The region has seen development in terms of civic infrastructure and educational institutes but people have to look outside for jobs.
The exodus of trained professionals to other cities has not stopped, Patil said. Ajit Pawar is Sharad Pawar’s nephew.
Work and votes
Patil said that in spite of the development work done by the Pawar family, it needn’t translate into votes in Baramati and other areas of Pune district. People are looking forward to the status quo getting broken and development picking up, he said.
Elections are just nine days away, but there is no buzz in the city and the surrounding rural areas. Large hoardings, banners and loud campaigning by zealous party workers are all missing. The city will witness a four-corner fight between the NCP, Congress, BJP and Shiv Sena. The NCP faces a tough contest in its traditional vote bank.
But dislodging Ajit Pawar, who has been the local MLA since 1991, will be an uphill task for the NCP’s rivals.
The BJP is expected to put up a tough fight against him, said political analyst MR Joshi.

Mercedes to make CLA-Class sedan at Chakan
Rutam Vora
Boris Fitz (extreme right),Vice-president – Sales and Network Development, Mercedes-Benz India Pvt Ltd and Sanjay Thakker, Chairman, Benchmark Cars – a Mercedes dealer at the launch of new GLA-Class SUV in Ahmedabad on Monday.
Production likely to begin from first quarter of 2015 at Chakan unit
Ahmedabad, Oct 6:  
Luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz India is planning to locally produce one of its global hotcake models – CLA Class Sedan at its Chakan facility near Pune. The CLA Class Sedan, which will be the sixth model from Mercedes-Benz India’s stable to be manufactured locally, is slated to be launched in India by the first quarter of 2015.
On the sidelines of a launch in Ahmedabad on Monday, Boris Fitz, vice-president – Sales and Network Development, Mercedes-Benz India Pvt Ltd confirmed that Mercedes’s CLA Class Sedan will be manufactured locally. However, it is not yet clear as to when the production will begin.
The localisation is believed to help company reduce costs and give a competitive price to the new model. However, the prices were not revealed at present. The model is believed to compete with Audi's A3 sedan in India.
Currently, Mercedes makes five models, three sedans – S-Class, E-Class, C-Class and two SUV models GL-Class and the M-Class locally. The A-Class, B-Class, CLS-Class and SLK-Class are Completely Built Imported units.
Mercedes is sourcing about 40 per cent of its required parts for the five models from Indian suppliers. This includes engine, transmission, wiring, and paint among others.
Notably, at the 12th Auto Expo held in New Delhi earlier this year, Mercedes-Benz had showcased the CLA 45 AMG, which had received good amount of attention from car enthusiasts.
The German car maker has already initiated expansion at its Chakan facility to double the capacity from the existing 10,000 units per year. “We had invested Rs 600 crore for setting up this plant. The doubling of the capacity will be done with an additional investment of Rs 250 crore at the same site,” said Boris Fitz, vice-president – Sales and Network Development, Mercedes-Benz India Pvt Ltd.
According to Fitz, the luxury car segment in the country has witnessed increased interest from young buyers. “We are experiencing more demand for our luxury compact cars A and B Class from young customers including women. Also SUVs like GL, GLA and M-Class are high in demand from the next generation customers. These segments are growing faster than the traditional sedan segments,” said Fitz, who was in town for launch of GLA-Class SUV in the state.
Out of the total car sales of 7,529 units during January-September 2014 period, about 20 per cent is compact cars (A-Class and B-Class), while 25 per cent is SUVs. The SUV segment has witnessed 100 per cent sales growth against last year, while overall sales have increased by 16 per cent against last year.
Mercedes-Benz has so far received 600 bookings from across the country for its recently-launched SUV GLA-Class.
“Out of 600 bookings nationally, about 70 are from Gujarat. The state is a big market for Mercedes. Gujarat contributes nearly 7.5 per cent to national sales,” said Sanjay Thakker, chairman, Benchmark Cars – a Mercedes dealer in Ahmedabad. Mercedes has four showrooms across Gujarat, while nationally it has 65 outlets spread across 36 cities.

China investors surged into EU in crisisChinese investors surged into EU at height of debt crisis
By Jamil Anderlini in Beijing
©AP
As investors fled Europe in the worst days of its sovereign debt crisis, China-based companies moved in the other direction and surged in, with cash flowing from China into some of the hardest-hit countries of the eurozone periphery.
In 2010, the total stock of Chinese direct investment in the EU was just over €6.1bn – less than what was held by India, Iceland or Nigeria. By the end of 2012, Chinese investment stock had quadrupled, to nearly €27bn, according to figures compiled by Deutsche Bank.
The buying spree, analysts say, was nothing short of a transformation of the model of Chinese outbound investment. It is expected to increase steadily over the next decade.

Chinese translate the European work ethic
“We saw a massive spike in Chinese investment in Europe, particularly [mergers and acquisitions] during the height of the debt crisis,” says Thilo Hanemann, an expert in Chinese outbound investment and research director at Rhodium Group, a research consultancy.
“This was partly opportunistic buying because assets were cheap and partly it was a structural secular shift in Chinese outbound investment, from securing natural resources in developing countries to acquiring brands and technology in developed countries.”
The Financial Times this week investigates the modern trail of Chinese investment, migration and ambition in Europe. A series of reports from Beijing to Milan to Madrid to Lisbon to Athens reveal the scale of China’s expansion in Europe, the flow of investment and the strategies of Chinese investors and migrants caught up in a national effort – a “going out” policy in place since 1999 – to find new markets and enhance China’s economic strength.
The incursion has not been all plain sailing. When a Chinese state-owned consortium won the bid to build a road from Warsaw to the German border, the government in Beijing presented the deal as a model for Chinese contractors in Europe.
But after cost over-runs and repeated breaches of local labour law, the Polish government cancelled the contract with Covec, the Chinese consortium, in 2011 – less than two years into the project.
What befuddled the Chinese company most were Polish environmental laws requiring tunnels for wildlife to be built beneath the road and a two-week work stoppage while seven rare species of frogs, toads and newts were moved out of the way.
The disaster has become business folklore in Beijing – a parable of the legal and cultural issues Chinese investors face when trying to do business or buy companies in Europe. Still, the obstacles faced by Covec, as well as other pioneering companies, have not dented China’s confidence in European ventures even in times of turmoil.
Total annual Chinese investment in Europe has dropped somewhat from the peak years of 2011 and 2012, but analysts across the continent see robust deals in the making and signs that investment will increase significantly this decade.
Official data on Chinese outbound – and inbound – investment are notoriously unreliable because the government does not measure most activity by Chinese companies’ offshore subsidiaries and does not attempt to work out where investment ends up.
Independent entities such as Rhodium Group and the Heritage Foundation, a conservative US-based think-tank, have chronicled a recent shift in Chinese money from resource-rich developing countries in Africa to partnerships in developed countries, including Europe.
Private Chinese enterprises are playing an important role in the transition. State-owned Chinese companies were the vanguard for China’s outward investment, with state-owned businesses accounting for 78 per cent of investment in Europe between 2008 and 2013, according to Deutsche Bank. At home, state behemoths dominate industries such as telecoms, transport, energy and finance.
But between 2011 and 2013, private companies’ share in Chinese M&A activity in the continent rose to over 30 per cent – compared to 4 per cent in the previous three years, Deutsche Bank research shows.
Investment tends to cluster in individual countries in any given year, according to data compiled by the Heritage Foundation . So far in 2014, Italy has been China’s biggest target in Europe with a surge of investment in the first half of the year. Close to half of the $7bn in total Chinese investment in Italy was made in 2014 alone. Portugal saw a jump in 2011 and in 2014. The UK has had two years of soaring Chinese activity. Since the debt crisis, Spain has experienced steady increases.
Chinese investment into Europe – while growing – still faces several obstacles. “Relative to China’s $4tn in foreign exchange reserves, the volumes are still not that large because Europe is not willing to sell China its top technologies and it doesn’t have very much else that China really wants,” said Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the conservative US think-tank, the American Enterprise Institute, and compiler of an independent database on Chinese outbound investment. “In the future, we’re probably going to see a steady increase [in Chinese investment to Europe] but no huge breakthroughs.”
“Companies are now buying $200m German companies instead of $20m ones,” Mr Scissors said.
Foreign direct investment into China, which hit $117bn last year, still significantly outstrips China outbound investment, which reached $108bn in 2013, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce data.
Those same figures suggest Europe was the only region that saw a drop in outbound Chinese investment in 2013, with a fall of more than 15 per cent. However, the data appear to significantly undercount the actual flow and do not count investment routed to Europe through Hong Kong.
In just one example of how problematic these official figures can be, they have historically counted tiny Luxembourg as the largest recipient of Chinese investment in Europe. That is because Chinese companies often choose to incorporate legal entities there to take advantage of looser tax and corporate structure requirements before using those entities to make investments elsewhere in the continent.
Liao Qun, chief economist and head of research at Citic Bank, predicts China’s total outbound investment to exceed $200bn by 2017 and a growing share of that amount will be destined for Europe.
A survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China found that Chinese companies rated labour laws, human resource costs, immigration rules and “cultural differences in management style” as the biggest obstacles to operating in the continent.
But in a sign of things to come, an overwhelming majority – 97 per cent – of Chinese companies that have invested in Europe said they plan to invest more in the coming years.
Rise of the Chinese private equity buyer
The sale of PizzaExpress, a popular UK restaurant chain, to Beijing-based Hony Capital in July highlights the rise of Chinese private equity buyers determined to snap up assets across Europe, writes Anne-Sylvaine Chassany.
“Suddenly there’s a growing interest in Europe to understand this new contingent of buyers,” Iain Drayton, a Hong Kong-based Goldman Sachs banker who advises private equity groups, says. “A number of Chinese private equity firms have raised large pools of capital and are looking to deploy it beyond the boundaries of Asia, into Europe or the US.”
Hony Capital, with more than $6.8bn in assets under management in seven funds, is part of a new generation of homegrown investment firms now on the look out for overseas companies they think they can help expand in their domestic market. In doing so, they are emulating state owned companies that dipped their toes first over the past years, and have since ramped up efforts to acquire technologies and consumer brands in Europe.
Last month, the Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun submitted a last minute counterbid for Club Med, battling the Italian private equity group Investindustrial for control of the French holiday resort operator.
Chinese private equity groups are less likely to suffer from a lack of credibility than those earlier players, bankers say.
“In the past, Chinese companies tended to take longer than Western groups to make decisions on acquisitions, and would not live up to the price expectations they raised,” Eric Meyer, a Société Générale banker who has advised Chinese clients including Fosun, says. “It’s no longer the case. They are truly motivated buyers.”
State backed consumer group Bright Food sought and failed to buy United Biscuits, the UK maker of biscuits and Jaffa Cakes, in 2010. Two years later, however, the Shanghai-based company made a winning £1.2bn offer for breakfast cereal brand Weetabix. It has since added French wine merchant Diva Bordeaux to its European purchases . Chinese property and entertainment conglomerate Wanda paid more than £300m for Dorset luxury yachtmaker Sunseeker International last year.
The trend will only strengthen, according to Mr Drayton, as Chinese private equity groups will be able to pay the extra amount of money allowing them to win over western buyout groups in competitive auctions.

What s so special in officers of govt-run Dena BankWhat's so special in officers of govt-run Dena Bank?
N Sundaresha Subramanian |  Oct 07, 2014 12:50 AM IST
Dena Bank is among the smallest of public sector banks (PSBs). Its staff of 11,093 people is next to last among the state-run lenders. Only Punjab and Sind Bank has fewer employees, at 8,870. In most banking parameters such as deposits, advances, interest earned and net interest income, the Mumbai-based bank occupies the last but one position. Its name has often come up as a candidate for merger with a larger banks, whenever such debate surfaces.
To make it further clear, compare Dena’s vital statistics to those of Punjab National Bank (PNB). The second largest PSB had 63,292 employees. It had four times the deposit base of Dena at Rs 4.51 lakh-crore. PNB had, at the latest year's data, 4.5 times Dena’s advances at Rs 3.49 lakh crore and made a six-fold net profit of Rs 3,339 crore.
GOOD THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKETS?
The curious case of Dena Bank officials who were ahead of their peers in bigger banks, in making it to coveted positions...
11,093 No of employees at Dena Bank (Only Punjab & Sind Bank has lesser no of staff at 8,870)
63,292 No of employees at PNB, the second largest state-run bank
8 No of Dena Bank GMs who made it to executive director (ED) positions (While PNB, a Goliath in comparison, saw only 6 of its GMs rising to the positions of of ED)
13 Bank of Baroda GMs who became EDs in the past five years
9 Allahabad Bank GMs who became EDs in the past five years
S K Jain Now-jailed CMD of Syndicate Bank, arrested by CBI in a bribery case, was earlier with Dena Bank
In one critical parameter, though, Dena Bank beat the Goliath. In the past five years, eight Dena general managers (GMs) made it to executive director (ED) positions, whereas only six from PNB managed it.
And, not only PNB — Dena officers did better than their counterparts in most other banks. An analysis of 76 board appointments over five years shows Dena emerged as the third largest source of board members for PSBs. Only Bank of Baroda (13) and Allahabad Bank (9) saw more of their GMs becoming EDs in the past five years. Four -- Indian Bank, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and Punjab & Sind -- did not have even one appointment of this 76. Bank of India equaled Dena’s tally at eight; others managed between one and seven board seats. But none punched above their weight like Dena’s officers did.
Dena GMs not only beat their peers from much larger banks but went on to take up the top position in much larger lenders on a couple of occasions. One of these was the now-jailed chairman and managing director of Syndicate Bank, S K Jain. CBI arrested Jain early last month while allegedly taking a bribe from a corporate houses. He was among the most rewarded GMs from Dena. From the second smallest bank, he took a board seat in the much bigger Bank of Baroda and then became CMD of Syndicate Bank in 2013.
An email seeking comments on the extraordinary performance of Dena officers to the bank's CMD last month did not elicit any response.
Critics of the current system of selecting bank managers for positions on PSB boards say the lack of proper guidelines has made the process controversial and susceptible to favoritism and corruption. The finance minister himself has referred the issue for review to the Reserve Bank of India. Bankers say it is near-impossible for a person from a smaller bank to come up winner in a strictly merit-based selection process. For, in range of products, complexity of issues and quality of work, the larger banks would offer much more exposure to its officers.
So, the fact that Dena Bank officers have managed it on a consistent basis has raised several eyebrows in banking circles. What makes Dena GMs more successful than others in the national selection process? Sources allege an influential Gujarati politician in the earlier United Progressive Alliance regime and his bureaucrat ally in North Block had created a green channel of sorts. Incidentally, Dena Bank leads the SLBC (State Level Bankers’ Committee) for Gujarat. Successive Dena board aspirants are said to have used this channel effectively.
A former CMD of a PSB said the process was not transparent and criteria kept changing. “People are shortlisted by the ministry on seniority and merit, and called for an interaction — they don’t call it an interview,” he said.
Acknowledging that a number of smaller banks have dominated board appointments as ED and CMD in recent times, former Bank of Baroda chief Anil Khandelwal said: “I would only say the selection process and grooming process of board members and CMDs needs reforms. It appears the system has a number of flaws. The selection of a chairman cannot be only a departmental process. A lot of due-diligence has to go into (examining the) experience and leadership qualities of candidates.”
He said it was time the earlier Khandelwal committee recommendations on a system of appointment for CMDs and EDs is implemented. He contended a pool of talented deputy general managers and GMs should be identified and put through a rigorous system of leadership development.
Adding: “The scheme of board nominations dates back to the time of bank nationalisation; it is 45 years old. Board reforms are long overdue and are unpostponable in the current context.” He referred to the PJ Nayak committee report on banks' governance, which highlighted many pitfalls in the nomination of people on the board of PSBs.
The report had said, “It is unclear that the boards of most of these banks have the required sense of purpose, in terms of their focus on business strategy and risk management, in being able to provide oversight to steer the banks through their present difficult position. The boards are disempowered and the selection process for directors is increasingly compromised. Board governance is, consequently, weak.”

Maruti to take on Honda  Hyundai sedans with CiazMaruti to take on Honda, Hyundai sedans with Ciaz
BS Reporter |  Oct 07, 2014 12:58 AM IST
Maruti Suzuki on Monday launched its most audacious attempt at gatecrashing the mid-sized sedan party, with the Ciaz, priced Rs 6.99-9.80 lakh in India. With this model, the country’s largest carmaker hopes to shrug off its image as a manufacturer of small cars and compete with Honda’s City and Hyundai’s Verna, the leaders in a segment that sells 16,000 cars a month.
Developed at an investment of Rs 620 crore, the most on a car by Maruti Suzuki, the Ciaz will also be exported to West Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America. The car is being launched commercially within nine months of the concept being unveiled at the Auto Expo in February. The Ciaz comes strapped with Maruti Suzuki’s 91-bhp, 1.4-litre K-Series petrol and 89-bhp, 1.3-litre DDiS diesel engines. According to the company, the diesel version delivers a fuel efficiency of 26.2 kmpl and the petrol variant of 20.7 kmpl. Maruti Suzuki on Monday said the Ciaz offered 10-12 per cent more room than other mid-sized sedans.
“We have designed this car keeping in mind the needs and expectations of the Indian sedan customer. The car has great looks, plush interiors, and offers generous room and comfort. Ciaz Diesel is India’s most fuel-efficient car today,” said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director & chief executive of Maruti Suzuki.  The Ciaz, which will replace the SX4, has been booked by 10,000 people over the past month. About 60 per cent of the bookings are for the diesel variants.
This will be Maruti Suzuki’s fourth attempt in over a decade to prise open the mid-sized sedan market in India. Consumer response to the discontinued Baleno, SX4 and the Kizashi has been lukewarm. Sales were anaemic in comparison with the company’s best-sellers, the Swift hatchback and DZire compact sedan that sold 15,000 cars a month even in the midst of an economic downturn.
At its peak, about 3,000 units of the SX4 were sold in a month, while segment leader Honda City sells about 5,000 units. The Kizashi was discontinued within two years of launch in India.
“We are supporting this great product with effective communication and new initiatives. Just a few days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited global industry majors to ‘Make In India’. Maruti Suzuki will make Ciaz in India with over 98 per cent localisation. And, the car will be exported from India to several countries around the world,” Ayukawa added.
The Ciaz will be available in four variants, with both manual and automatic transmissions. In India, the Ciaz goes head to head with the Honda City, priced at Rs 7.19-11.05 lakh and the Hyundai Verna, priced at Rs 7.39-11.72 lakh (ex showroom Delhi). The City has been Honda’s flagship car in India for over a decade and sold 210 per cent more at 30,447 in the first five months of 2014-15. The Verna, with a sporty styling, also has a fair share of buyers.  Maruti Suzuki is confident the Ciaz will expand its presence among mid-sized sedans. “There are 1.4 million customers of the Swift and DZire. The Ciaz is a natural upgrade for them. We are expecting to sell 60,000-80,000 cars in the first year of launch. The Ciaz is a great product and we expect the overall segment to grow with it,” said R S Kalsi, executive director (marketing & sales), Maruti Suzuki.
The Ciaz is also the first of many premium products Maruti Suzuki has up its sleeve. The company is slated to drive in the S-Cross and a larger sports utility vehicle in 2015, followed by a compact SUV based on the XA Alpha in 2016.

Generation globetrotterChasing a generation of globally mobile students
By Helen Warrell
©Xinhua/Wang Jianhua/eyevine
Degrees of success: a graduation ceremony at Peking University in Beijing. China is spending $250bn a year to improve its universities
More than 150 years ago, the Catholic cardinal John Henry Newman set out his vision for a university as “a place of concourse, whither students come from every quarter for every kind of knowledge”. As students have become more mobile, and higher education institutions more international, Cardinal Newman might be surprised at the truly diverse concourse of the modern education market.
Driving the globalisation of universities are children from the middle classes in emerging economies who aspire to highly skilled jobs. In Asia especially, the development of universities has not kept pace with rising levels of affluence, creating a shortfall of places. As a result, western economies are vying to attract a growing pool of youngsters looking to study abroad. And in fast-growing nations such as India and Brazil, the race to build more universities is on.
New funding models aim to reverse Latin America’s academic decline
Much of this change is necessitated by sheer demographics. More than half of India’s population is under 25 years old; by 2020 it will be ahead of China as the country with the largest population at tertiary-education age. The flow of Chinese students overseas is expected to grow as much as 15 per cent a year until 2018. Already, 2.5m students globally are studying outside their home country, creating a sector worth $30bn a year for the US, the UK, Canada and Australia, according to the Parthenon Group education consultancy.
For these traditional markets, the boom could not have come at a better time. Austerity has squeezed higher education state subsidies, while expenditure by universities is rising as competition – for the best staff, technology and facilities – increases. In the US in particular, rising costs and falling enrolments have put the long-term viability of some weaker universities at risk.
Last year, a report by education business Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and the Institute for Public Policy Research, the think-tank, predicted an “avalanche” in the market that would challenge 20th-century higher education institutions. Its authors observed that the traditional relationship between universities, students and national economies was increasingly under pressure.

Western governments are all too aware of the threat to their academic centres and have made efforts to boost higher education exports. Despite domestic political concerns about immigration, Australia has loosened visa rules around international students to draw youngsters away from the two most popular university destinations, the US and the UK.
In the UK, stricter border controls led to a 49 per cent drop in enrolments from Indian students between 2011 and 2013, and a 38 per cent decrease for those from Pakistan. But these falls have been largely offset by huge increases from China, and a dedicated education export unit in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is working to build better links with international universities via branch campuses and shared courses.
While revenue from overseas students has provided a lifeline for cash-strapped institutions, Mike Boxall, a higher education expert at PA Consulting Group, says there are dangers in having too many incomers. “We are hearing anecdotally that [in some universities] this has reached an uncomfortable limit,” he says. “Students who have come halfway round the world to get an English experience… come into a classroom to find there are lots of other international students there too.”

Branching out: construction of a New York University outpost in Abu Dhabi
Emerging economies face different hurdles. China has an ambitious $250bn-a-year programme to develop its universities and research facilities, but governments elsewhere are more restricted. Karan Khemka, co-head of the Parthenon Group’s education practice, suggested in an essay for Harvard Business Review that the “western model” of state-funded university education “is a luxury emerging markets, with limited resources, cannot afford”.
Instead, these countries rely heavily on for-profit providers to build a university sector that is rapidly scalable and sustainable in the long term. The UK’s university unions and some parts of its academic establishment have been sceptical of private institutions, casting doubts over their quality and value for money. But across Asia and Latin America, these providers do not carry the same stigma. In Malaysia, the private higher education market was worth $2.4bn, or about 1 per cent of gross domestic product, in 2012.
“In emerging markets it is absolutely the case that private universities are responding to growing demand,” Khemka says. “In Brazil, most higher education enrolments are in private universities.”
As old and new economies battle with how to deliver good-quality education to increasingly mobile students, technology could provide part of the answer. Massive open online courses, or Moocs , beam mostly free lectures and teaching programmes designed by top academics around the world to anyone with an internet connection.
The western model of state-funded university education is a luxury emerging markets, with limited resources, cannot afford
Though some fear Moocs threaten the future of traditional, campus-based universities – particularly the attractiveness of this model to overseas students – it seems more likely they will provide a different and complementary way of consuming academic content.
Nick Hillman, director of the UK’s Higher Education Policy Institute think-tank, says in large parts of the world, including much of Asia, distance learning is still an “untrusted model”. “My hunch is that Moocs have most to offer the developing world, including large parts of Africa, as the value added is greater for those people who get access to trusted world-class resources for the first time,” he says.
Disruptive technologies, demographic change and changing patterns of economic growth have shaped significant changes in how universities function. Hillman describes the new outlook as “more students, more focus on teaching, a more international outlook, a more diverse range of providers and more collaboration on research”.
Longstanding academic institutions in countries such as the UK and US are finding new ways to distinguish themselves. They are deepening links with industry to fund research and help bring their findings to market, and taking more notice of what employers want from graduates. Some are opening international campuses in Asia and the Middle East to entice local students and using the internet to reach a wider audience.
Boxall believes in the UK, at least, three broad categories of university will emerge – oligarchs, innovators and zombies. Established brands such as Oxford and Cambridge are the oligarchs, assured of survival. Innovators are the middle-ranking universities prepared to take risks to bring in new students. Meanwhile, the zombies, which refuse to change and suffer declining enrolments, will spiral into extinction.
He argues that the future challenge for higher education institutions will be to stay in the game at a time when it is easy for aspiring students to access the knowledge and skills they need from elsewhere, whether online, directly from working with industry or through hybrid courses designed and funded by an employer.
“The world is in the business of finding solutions to multi-faceted problems and yet universities are still in the business of finding applications for curiosity-driven research,” Boxall observes. “The threat is not recognising this and becoming less and less relevant as time goes on.”

Mahindra to buy 51% in Peugeot scooter unitMahindra to buy 51% in Peugeot scooter unit
Reuters/ BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 09:20 AM IST
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd
, India's largest utility vehicle maker, said on Tuesday its two-wheeler unit has made a binding offer to acquire a 51% stake in PSA Peugeot Citroen's
scooters business.
The deal will involve infusion of 15 million euros ($18.93 million) into Peugeot Motorcycles to finance projects, Mahindra said in a statement issued to the National Stock Exchange. The company did not give more information about the transaction.
The deal will provide M&M with Peugeot's ready technology, as well as reach in western markets. Though M&M has been making scooters since 2008, its presence in this segment is negligible.
After it shut an engine plant two years ago, Peugeot's scooter business had become a "drag and burden on the group", according to chief executive Carlos Tavares, who took charge of the company in March. Since the past few months, Peugeot has been exploring various options to address this issue.
M&M has seen some success with economy motorcycle Centuro, launched last year. After starting with technology borrowed from the now defunct Kinetic Motors, M&M has been tapping technology used in its sports utility vehicles for its two-wheelers.
However, the two-wheeler business has been a drag on the group, posting a loss of Rs 459 crore last financial year and an accumulated loss of Rs 1,250 crore, according to disclosures in the company's annual report. After six product launches and investment of about Rs 500 crore, the two-wheeler business was declared "potentially sick". This followed its accumulated losses peaking to Rs 790 crore at the end of March 2013.
In 2013-14, the company's two-wheeler sales rose 93% to 202,759 units; the Centuro accounted for 73 per cent of these sales. Mahindra Two Wheelers retails five scooter models and two motorcycles. It plans to launch a new scooter in a few weeks.
Peugeot's scooter business, which has posted losses through a decade, sold 79,000 vehicles last year, a rise of 8.2%. The unit employs about 500 people in France and 300 at a joint venture in China.

Rupee gains 22 paise against dollar in early tradeRupee gains 22 paise against dollar in early trade
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 09:55 AM IST
After a long weekend, the rupee strengthened by 22 paise to 61.39 against the dollar in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange today on increased selling of the US currency by exporters and banks.
Forex dealers said besides increased selling of the American currency by exporters and banks, the dollar's weakness against other currencies overseas also supported the rupee, but a lower opening in the domestic equity market limited the rise.
The domestic currency had gained 14 paise to close at 61.61 against the dollar on October 1.
Forex market remained closed on October 2, 3 and 6 for Gandhi Jayanti, Dussehra and Id-ul-Zuha, respectively.
Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell by 137.34 points, or 0.51%, to 26,430.65 in early trade today.

NEW DELHI|BANGALORE|KOLKATA: Flipkart, the merchants on its platform and manufacturers are sharing the tab for the biggest sale-day yet in Indian online retail.
The Bangalore-based company sold goods worth $100 million on Monday and the deep discounts will mean that its margins are going to be negative, but it is counting on some help from its partners while it stays focussed on boosting its topline.
Flipkart, the country's largest online retailer, has been offering deep discounts across categories, stretching up to 80%, as it looks to widen its lead over rivals Snapdeal and Amazon.
The company has raised a total of $1.2 billion this year, equipping it with a cash hoard that it is using to further its goal of increasing market share and growing the size of the market.
Sachin Bansal , the cofounder and CEO, said Flipkart had been working on the offers with brands and sellers for the past few months. The deals it strikes vary across categories and merchants, with no standard formula. In some cases, sellers have picked up the full tab.
For example, Pepper Closet, a merchant with Flipkart for about a month, had differential discounts depending on the product. For apparel, Pepper Closet was keen on clearing its surplus inventory and therefore picked up the bill for a 50% discount, business head Kanwar Singh said. On the other hand, for kitchen and bar utility items, Flipkart is bearing the cost of the 20-40% discount.
Not all sellers have come on board to share the tab with the online retailer. A senior executive of a leading consumer electronics retail chain said the discounts are driven entirely by the marketplaces. "We as a seller did not even know that few of our listed products would get discounted for these flash sales," he said, requesting anonymity.
Another seller said the company had listed its models at the existing market price in the offline trade. "But we were shocked to see that the product has been sold at a discount which is actually lower than our buying price. But we have been assured we will get the full amount at which we have listed it," he said.
Since online retail is a nascent industry, companies are not too perturbed by negative margins, and investors are backing the game plan of acquiring customers at the expense of the bottomline.
Even Amazon , which posted revenue of $75 billion last year, has red ink on its books. "It's a tactical call taken by Flipkart, and they have certainly done the math. These (discounts) are built into their margin model," said Ankur Bisen, vice president at Technopak .

Pak fires across border again in Jammu  40 BSF posts targetedPakistan fires at 40 BSF posts in Jammu, protests at UN
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu, October 07, 2014
First Published: 07:57 IST(7/10/2014) | Last Updated: 19:13 IST(7/10/2014)
Comments
Pakistani mortars continued to pound villages along the Jammu border for a second straight day on Tuesday as they targeted 40 Border Security Force (BSF) posts in the region, wounding six civilians and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes.
 
BSF officials said Indian forces retaliated with gunfire and mortar bombs after Pakistan Rangers widened the range of their attacks to Poonch, Kanachak, Pargwal, Arnia, Akhnoor and RS Pura sectors, a day after mortar bombs killed five civilians and wounded 29 in the highest civilian death toll in a single day in more than a decade.

“Pakistan targeted 40 of our posts in RS Pura and Akhnoor sector without provocation,” said the BSF inspector general in Jammu, Rajesh Sharma. “We were then forced to fire back in equally strong measure.”
 
Media reports said the Indian and Pakistani DGMOs held talks on ceasefire violations and accused each other of violating the ceasefire.
 
India and Pakistan have been trading fire for about a week, straining India-Pakistan relations which hit a low after New Delhi called off foreign secretary-level talks in August following the Pakistani high commissioner’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders.
This year has been particularly volatile along the border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, which is due for assembly polls as Pakistan typically ratchets up border tensions every time the state holds elections.
 
Pakistan registered its protest with the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) over the firing by the Indian military along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
The BSF director general told HT on Tuesday Indian and Pakistani troops will likely continue shelling each other for a few more days, vowing to give a fitting reply in  the unexpected flare-up that has so far claimed 18 lives on both sides of the border.
 
Sartaj Aziz, Advisor to the Pakistan Prime Minister on National Security and Foreign Affairs, expressed concern over the situation along the Line of Control.
 
"The Indian government has not been able to restrain its forces despite strong diplomatic protest by Pakistan," he said.     "We call upon the Indian government to immediately cease fire and shelling and help us preserve tranquility," he said in a statement.
Aziz said the Pakistani government has been exercising "utmost restraint and responsibility”.
 
“We also extended a hand of friendship to India. However, with abrupt cancellation of foreign secretary-level talks, the Indian side has shunned all our peace overtures. We hope that the Indian side would give peace a chance," he said.
 
BSF sources said Pakistan was deliberately targeting Arnia town, which is about three kilometres from the border, to inflict maximum civilian causalities.
 
“Pakistan is firing about 1.5 km from behind the fence for effective firing. It’s also being done to move away from our radar of observation along the fence. The firing during the night is also the reason for it,” said a BSF official.
 
Home minister Rajnath Singh has urged Pakistan to stop violating the ceasefire attacks if it wants peace talks with India.
 
“We will not tolerate such acts of border violations. We are for peaceful relationship but not at the cost of security to our civilians,” Singh told HT on Monday.

Sensex falls 144 points; metal stocks dragSensex tumbles to two-month low; down 296 points on capital outflows
Agencies
Metals, healthcare, capital goods and consumer durables major losers
Mumbai, Oct 7:  
The BSE benchmark Sensex today plunged 296 points to close at nearly two-month low due to widespread losses in metal, healthcare, consumer durables and capital goods sector stocks on capital outflows and retail investors ahead of earnings season amid a mixed trend overseas.
After opening 137 points lower, the 30-share index continued its slide to touch the day’s low of 26,250.24 before ending the day at almost two-month low of 26,271.97, a level not seen since August 14, registering a steep fall of 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
The gauge had lost 62.52 points in the previous session on Octrober 1. Stock markets remained closed on October 2, 3 and 6 for Gandhi Jayanti, Dussehra and Id-Ul-Zuha, respectively.
FII/FPIs pulled out Rs 63.24 crore from domestic markets on October 1, according to exchange data.
Similarly, the broad-based NSE Nifty closed down by 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent at 7,852.40 after shuttling between 7,943.05 and 7,842.70.
Brokers said the sentiment dampened on foreign capital outflows and offloading of positions by retail investors ahead of the earnings season, with Infosys posting results later this week.
Of the 30 Sensex shares, 23 closed lower led by Hindalco (down 4.35 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (4.32 per cent) and Cipla (3.67 per cent), while NTPC, Gail and Tata Motors remained major gainers.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 63.24 crore last Wednesday as per the provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
Sectorwise, BSE metal index suffered the most by falling 2.65 per cent, followed by healthcare by 1.85 per cent.
Captial goods index by 1.78 per cent, Consumer durables index by 1.72 per cent, Realy index 1.27 per cent, PSU index 1.20 per cent and Banking index 0.87 per cent were the other significant losers.
Global markets
Globally, a mixed closing on the other Asian markets and a lower opening of the European stocks as a report showed German industrial production contracted the most in more than five years, also negatively impacted sentiment.
European shares fell in early trade on Tuesday after German industrial output fell far more than expected, but losses were limited by gains in mining shares after Rio Tinto rejected a merger approach from rival Glencore.
At 0755 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 per cent at 1,341.44 points. The benchmark index had gained 1.1 per cent over the past two sessions.
"Volatility has surged again in Europe, but there's no clear trend in terms of direction," Aurel BGC analyst Gerard Sagnier said. "It's better to move to the sidelines for now. Investors need to be patient, the bullish trend will resume at some point."
Asian shares rose on Tuesday, while the dollar languished after investors locked in some gains on its recent rally.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up about 0.3 per cent in late afternoon trade, after wobbling between positive and negative territory as it took its cues from a choppy, losing session on Wall Street overnight.
Japan's Nikkei stock average ended down 0.7 percent, after the Bank of Japan offered a bleaker view on factory output. The BOJ maintained its massive asset buying programme, as widely expected.
Hong Kong shares finished higher for a third day in a row on Tuesday, with investor confidence recovering as pro-democracy demonstrations eased in the wake of a meeting between protest leaders and government officials.
The Hang Seng Index rose 0.5 percent to 23,422.52 points. The China Enterprises Index of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was 0.6 percent higher.

Bay low intensifies  looks to become depressionDepression materialises in the Bay, set to become a cyclone
Vinson Kurian
Source: IMD Satellite image taken on October 7, 2014.
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 7:  
The well-marked low-pressure area over north Andaman Sea has concentrated into a monsoon depression this afternoon, an India Met Department update said.
It will move in west-northwesterly direction and further intensify into a deep depression by tomorrow (Wednesday) and thereafter as a tropical cyclone.
TROPICAL CYCLONE
It will cross the Andaman and Nicobar Islands tomorrow and set itself on a course for the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coasts as a tropical cyclone.
It will have enough time and space to ramp up into a severe or even a very severe cyclone, according to a few international models.
The US Navy’s Joint Typhoon Warning Centre upgraded to ‘medium’ the possibility of a ‘significant tropical cyclone’ spinning up in the Bay in the next 24 hours.
Over the mainland, isolated heavy rainfall is forecast for the rest of the day over south interior Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry.
Weather over Andaman and Nicobar Islands may deteriorate tomorrow with the expected crossing of the cyclonic storm.
HIGH WINDS, HEAVY RAIN
Gale-force winds have been forecast reaching 70- to 80 km/hr, and fishermen have been directed not to venture out into the sea.
Isolated heavy rainfall would continue to lash south interior Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.
Squally weather has been forecast for the Nicobar Islands on Thursday as the cyclonic storm steps out into the open Bay of Bengal towards the east coast of mainland India.
Meanwhile, southern and southwestern Myanmar (especially the Ayerawaddy river mouth) also may get lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall during this phase.
The cyclone, to be named ‘Hudhud’ (contributed by Oman) as per protocol, is now expected to cross mostly the Odisha coast by the weekend, suggests a Met outlook.
A few international models indicate that the system might take a more southerly track towards north coastal Andhra Pradesh.
STRONG CYCLONE?
For instance, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The Centre seems to have lately shed its inhibitions about the extent to which the storm might strengthen.
It sees a strong to very strong system (severe to very severe cyclone) impacting the Andhra Pradesh coast by Saturday.
Back home, the Met sees the southerly-to-southeasterlies wrapping into the Bay system bringing heavy rain initially to Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha coasts from the weekend.
The building cyclone would be the first ahead of the onset of the northeast monsoon, which is likely to be declared along the time of, or shortly after, the landfall.
As if on cue, the withdrawal of incumbent southwest monsoon is gathering pace over mainland India as the peninsula gets covered during the next few days.
It is already knocking at the doors of the peninsula, having reached Hoshangabad, Malegaon and Dahanu this afternoon.

Day after Flipkart s big bang  Myntra offers up a damp squibDay after Flipkart's big bang, Myntra offers up a damp squib
Itika Punit Sharma | Bangalore Oct 07, 2014 10:52 AM IST
At 8 a.m. Monday, Flipkart.com gave visitors a feeling of a flea market on a Sunday evening. Every time the homepage was refreshed, some product or the other was ‘sold out’. It lent a sense of urgency, even for people like me who had nothing in particular to shop for. There was no one in sight, but it just felt like you were pushing your way through fellow-buyers to get the shopkeeper’s attention.
 
Despite the agony of technical glitches and several other issues, many said it reminded the e-commerce generation of the sweaty and crowded Diwali markets we once shopped at with our grandparents.
 
So this morning when I saw a jacket ad in the newspapers about Myntra’s ‘Cracker of a Sale’ offering a flat 50% discount, I could not resist but log in right at 8 a.m., when the sale was to begin, with hopes of a similar mela.
 
Well, I guess I was the only one to do so.
 
Unlike the bright orange ‘Big Billion Day’ backdrop of Flipkart’s website, which screamed ‘celebration’ and ‘festivity’, Myntra’s ‘cracker’ appears to be a no-noise version.
 
May be it was buyers' fatigu from yesterday, so no one’s woken up early, I thought. So I stayed, and refreshed the website over and over. But well, nothing felt exciting or ticking, except for a timer on the sale page (that has about 14,800 products), which says that the offer will end in 14 hours 10 minutes and 27 seconds now.
 
On Monday, it was hard to miss the buzz of #BigBillionDay and #CheckSnapdealToday, which were both trending for over 12 hours on micro-blogging website Twitter. So I decided to check out what people are saying about Myntra’s offer there.
 
To my surprise, even the trollers are not making jokes about the Myntra sale! (In fact some Myntra staffers appear to be trying to wake each other up with “Good morning team” messages!)
 
This tweet (one of the only two consumer tweets I could find this morning) by Chitra Narayanan seems to have summed up the general sentiment: “I am beginning to develop an allergy to the word 'sale'  #Myntra”
 
The husband had this observation to offer: "if a girl is saying that, there’s something seriously wrong with the world!”
 

Efforts to strengthen bond with overseas Ind...Insurability
("Am very glad to share that…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday said efforts for overseas Indians being undertaken by the government will help "further strengthen our bond with the diaspora".
In a series of tweets, Modi said: "Am very glad to share that government of India has moved swiftly on the announcements I had made on consular and visa issues during my US visit."
"Am sure these efforts will further strengthen our bond with the diaspora and give an impetus to our development journey," he added.
The prime minister said that a Sep 30 Gazette notification said that all Person of Indian Origin (PIO) cards are valid for lifetime of cardholders. Earlier it was for 15 years.
"The gazette notification fulfils the announcement that all PIO cardholders will now enjoy a lifelong visa to India," he said.
He said that the gazette notification also says that PIO card holders would not have to report to police stations, even if their visit exceeds 180 days.
"Instructions have been issued to embassies and consulates that apart from special circumstances, US nationals should get visas for 10 years," he said, adding that the ministry of home affairs is working on the new scheme which will merge the People of Indian Origin (PIO) and Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) schemes.
Modi had made a number of announcements on consular and visa issues during his address at the Madison Square Garden in New York Sep 28, while he was on a five-day sojourn to the US.

Anti-BJP rhetoric shows Sena has lost the battle  says BJPComments
Shiv Sena's attack on BJP shows that the party founded by late Bal Thackeray has "lost the battle" ahead of the October 15 Maharashtra Assembly elections, senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said in Mumbai on Tuesday.
"They (Sena) have lost track and are talking only about BJP," Rudy, BJP's Maharashtra affairs in-charge, told PTI in an interview.
"If they (Sena) are contesting to win the elections, then they should be contesting against Congress and NCP. But if they are talking about BJP, it possibly shows that they have lost the battle," Rudy said.
Maharashtra vs Gujarat ammo against PM; BJP, Modi prime targets
"They are cribbing partners. We are absolutely not talking about them as a matter of policy. The prime minister has clearly spelt it out," he said.
"It is amusing that Sena is not fighting the actual enemies of the state. And they say we have betrayed them. How does it matter? You were claiming to be a larger partner and more powerful. Why should you complain?" he said.
"They (Sena) must have assessed that they are losing ground to BJP very heavily. So this desperation," Rudy said, when asked about Sena mouthpiece Saamana criticising Modi on his "won't utter a word against Sena" remark.
Asked what led to the snapping of the 25-year old alliance with Sena, Rudy said, "The central leadership of BJP was very persistent on an alliance. Somehow, the negotiations (on seat sharing) were not moving." "There was a lack of communication. And the Sena was still in the old mode for some reason and was not ready to scale down from 151 seats. And for us, it was practically impossible to come down below 130," he said.
"There was no question of leaving our new alliance partners, the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, Mahadeo Jankar-led Rashtriya Samaj Party, RPI and Vinayak Mete-led Shivsangram. So, we had to find a solution," he said.
"Maybe, if poll dates were later, we could have found a solution, But it did not happen like that. The call was taken by the state BJP leadership,"  Rudy said.
"It was a case of 'who blinks first'. And in doing so, we came to a point where nothing was moving and there was no time to move further," he said. "There was no animosity in that but we had to take a call because time was only 48 hours to go before deadline for filing nominations ended," the BJP leader said.
"It was unspoken but possibly, the numbers were related to the chief ministerial post, which was not being discussed across the table. That could have been one of the factors," Rudy said. "People in Maharashtra have always seen a coalition government in the last several years. Now they have an opportunity to elect a single party government and BJP is a better choice," he said.
Asked about speculation that there could be a post-poll alliance with Sena, Rudy said, "I doubt that situation will arise. People will give a full mandate to BJP and our target is to unseat Congress and NCP. So there is no question of us coming together. We are not even thinking remotely about that."  Asked about NCP chief Sharad Pawar's remarks that Modi was addressing so many poll rallies, something which prime ministers don't do, Rudy said, "If the benchmark in this country for Congress was Manmohan Singh, what better explanation they can offer to us?"

Resume  bio data  CV: Know the differences before appearing for interview6
1
Do you often interchange the words Curriculum Vitae, Resume, or Bio data? Well, there are many who consider these words to be synonym and thus make random use. But beware! Doing this mistake can hamper your selection possibilities and make you disappointed. So, before you go for your next interview make sure that you know the difference among all three, so that you can use the words wisely.
Resume:
Resume is a word from French origin that means 'summary'. So, when the recruiter asks you to give a resume then that means he is interested in the summary of your employment, education, and skills that are relevant to the job position, which you are applying for. Ideally, a resume should not exceed one side of A4 sheet, and at the most both the side; but not more than that.
Resume means summary of your work experience, CV asks for details of one's education, professional life and bio data stands for personal details. ( A Resume , via Shutterstock)
#resume #bio data #curriculum vitae #interview
Resume Tips:
1. To keep your resume precise, avoid mentioning all those details which are not relevant to the job position. This also means that you should customize your resume targeting the job position.
2. Resume serves its purpose at the best in bullet form.
3. It is better to write your resume in third person.
4. Start with brief summary of qualification, then bullet the keywords for area of expertise, your key strengths followed by professional experience in reverse chronology.
5. Keep your focus upon recent experiences and you can summarize past experiences.
6. Never mention details like age, sex, religion, or hobbies.
7. Avoid using fancy fonts in your resume
What is the aim of resume?
A resume aims to provide a balance of responsibilities & accomplishments for each position to the recruiter.
CV or Curriculum Vitae
CV or Curriculum Vitae is a word from Latin origin and it means "Course of life". Thus, when you are asked for CV by a recruiter or hiring agency, then you have to mention the details about your education as well as professional life. Your CV can be of 2-3 pages or even more as per the details.
CV Tips:
List all the skills, jobs degrees, & professional affiliations the applicant has acquired, usually in chronological order.
What is the aim of CV?
Your CV should display your talent rather than any other specific skill for specific job position.
Bio Data
Bio Data means Biographical Data, and is now considered an old fashion word for both resume as well as CV. Generally, in bio-data, the emphasis has to be on personal details like D.O.B, religion, sex, race, nationality, residence, marital status, and similar details. Other than this, chronological list of education & experience is to be mentioned.
Also, Bio Data is a term that is generally used in India only and that too mostly for government jobs and research work where one requires giving descriptive details.
Hope you have now understood the prime difference among the three and next time when you'll go for your interview, you'll pick your bio data, CV, or resume precisely.

Jayalalithaa s lawyers press for bail on health groundsNo bail for Jayalalithaa, others
Our Bureau
J Jayalalithaa
Bangalore, October 7:  
The Karnataka High Court has refused to suspend sentence of the former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.
Few overenthisaistic lawyers supporting Jayalalithaa jumped to conclusion over the granting of bail, when high court was hearing all the arguments and clarifications presented by lawyers representing Jayalalithaa, Sasikala, Ilavarasi and Sudhakaran.
The earlier reports said the Karnataka High Court had granted condtional bail to the former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.
The court, which met after lunch session, heard some clarifications from Jayalalithaa’s lawyers.
After all the arguments, clarifications of all convicts concluded in the disproportionate assets case. The judge asked special public prosecutor G Bhavani Singh for his comments to which he said he had no objection to grant conditional bail to convicts.
Jubilant AIADMK workers burst crackers outside Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence in Chennai. After 11 days, the AIADMK party chief will now be released from the prison.
The former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister who is 66 years-old, is a diabetic and is suffering from blood pressure and heart-related ailments, her lawyers told High Court.
Senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani who finished his arguments has argued that Jayalalithaa is entitled for bail during pendency of appeal against conviction as per verdicts of Supreme Court on the subject of grant of bail after conviction.
Special Public Prosecutor G. Bhavani Singh has argued that Jayalalithaa being an influential person in Tamil Nadu, if granted bail, she may try to escape from conviction or abscond from the country.
Countering this argument, Jethmalani said, former Chief Minister is a law abiding citizen and will not abscond from the country.

Anti-Kannadiga posters dot Chennai ahead of Jayalalithaa s bail plea hearingAnti-Kannadiga posters dot Chennai ahead of Jayalalithaa's bail plea hearing
BS Reporter | Chennai Oct 07, 2014 12:29 PM IST
As the Karnataka High Court decides today whether AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa deserves bail in the 18-year-old disproportionate assets case, a series of xenophobic posters warning Karnataka have been erected across Chennai.
The most disturbing ones even threatened to hold Kannadigas living in the state hostage if Jayalalithaa is not released.
 
The posters carried the names of Trichy Member of Parliament P Kumar, state minister B Valarmathy, and state Assembly member V P Kalairajan. None of them were available for comment to verify whether the posters were placed by them. 
 
The caption in other posters said 'Can a mortal punish god', which was countered by an anti-AIADMK group on Facebook saying "Can God be at the mercy of a human being for bail?”
 
Another poster warned Karnataka: "Beware dry leaves! You have kept fire in jail. If you free her today, she will be the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. If her detention is prolonged, she will also become the Chief Minister of Karnataka."
 
“You keep Cauvery [waters] with you. Give me Amma,” one poster said, with the image of a crying baby alongside a picture of Jayalalithaa, suggesting a child asking for its mother. 
The Bangalore Commissioner of Police has spoken to his Chennai counterpart expressing concern over the anti-Kannadiga posters. The Chennai police chief has reportedly said that there is no danger to Kannadigas in the city and that the posters will be removed and action taken against the sponsors. 
 
Meanshile, anxiety and tension prevailed among AIADMK cadre, who are putting up road blocks, organising dharnas, fasting, and conducting poojas for their leader's release.
 
Meanwhile, private schools in Tamil Nadu have withdrawn their scheduled one day strike today seeking the release of the former chief minister who was jailed late last month on corruption charges. Earlier, about 12,000 schools in the state decided to close today, triggering angry reactions from parents as well as politicians.
 
School administrators have said they are participating in a hunger strike in Chennai today. 
 
One of the biggest vegetables, fruits and flowers markets in Asia – the Chennai Koyambedu market -- stayed closed today demanding the release of Jayalaithaa. About 4,000 shops were shut while 8,000 employees participated in a hunger strike. Residents of Madurai were also deprived of their daily quota of vegetables as the market remained closed. 
 
A few AIADMK party workers decided to undertake a 350km 'spiritual journey' by walking from Chennai to Parapana Agrahara central prison, where Jayalalithaa and the other three convicted in the wealth case are lodged. 
 
AIADMK cadres continued to stage demonstrations to convey their angst in various parts of the Southern Tamil Nadu. In Coimbatore, representatives of 22 government employee associations staged a hunger strike at Gandhipuram. Former MPs and MLAs participated in the protest. 
 
Tension and protest continues to prevail in the Tamil Nadu–Karnataka border town of Hosur.
 
In Tuticorin, AIADMK fishermen protested in mid-sea. They threw the effigy of Subramanian Swamy, who initiated the case against Jayalalithaa, into the sea and hanged the effigy of DMK Supermo M Karunanidhi from a boat. Fishermen in Rameswaram and Pamban went on an indefinite strike and in the hill station of Kodaikanal, shops and establishments were closed which affected, according to reports.
 
In Bangalore, anticipating a large presence of AIADMK cadre, the city police has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 in a one kilometre radius around the Karnataka High Court and around the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison.
 
Reports quoting Bangalore Police Commissioner M N Reddi said that security had been tightened and over 2,000 personnel led by a Joint Commissioner would be deployed at both places.

Nobody can divide Maharashtra, says Modi
Slamming Congress for the farmers' suicide in the last 10 years, Modi urged the people to punish the "murderers" of farmers in the October 15 Assembly elections.
Post your opinion here
 
Dismissing opposition charges, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today ruled out splitting of Maharashtra and separating Mumbai from the state.
"Congress leaders have been spreading lies on cotton and onion for the last 10 years. They have started spreading a new lie. They say Maharashtra will be split. Has anyone been born in this country who can divide the land of Shivaji ?" he said addressing a rally in the predominantly tribal Dhule district.
"I assure you that as long as I am in Delhi, no power in the world can split Maharashtra and also separate Mumbai from Maharashtra," he said. The Prime Minister's remarks come against the backdrop of MNS chief Raj Thackeray reportedly accusing Modi of having a "hidden agenda" to split Mumbai from Maharashtra.

The Prime Minister said Maharashtra is the state that has the capability to drive India's growth and Mumbai is central to that. Slamming Congress for the farmers' suicide in the last 10 years, Modi urged the people to punish the "murderers" of farmers in the October 15 Assembly elections.
"Press on the lotus button on October 15 and make it the liberation day for the state from 15 years of Congress misrule," he said. In an apparent dig at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Modi said he does not need to go the house of a poor person to "snatch" his food for a photo opportunity as he himself came from a poor family.
"I had come amidst you during Lok Sabha campaign. I had requested you to trust me. You believed in what I said and elected BJP MPs from Dhule and Nandurbar," Modi said. "Now, I have come to you again in four months.
Politicians forget to fulfil poll promises. But I am not a politician. I am your sevak. I am the first servant of India," the 64-year-old leader said. The Prime Minister said that when 60 months of "our regime will be complete, I will give account of every moment and every paisa.We made promises for development and we will keep them."
"Wait for October 15 (the polling day in Maharashtra). As soon as BJP government comes to power, we will rectify the damage done to cotton and onion growers due to the wrong policies of the erstwhile Congress and NCP government," he said.
"Unlike Congress, we are not the ones to make false promises," Modi said.
Congress leaders won so many polls on the promise of  completing work on the Manmad-Indore rail line but not a single inch of track was laid, he said.
"Did they (Congress) do anything in 50 years? From panchayat to Parliament, they ruled but did not give any  account of their 60-year rule," the senior BJP leader said.
"They are such shameless people that they are instead asking me an account of my 60 days. Isn't this injustice?" he said. "Those who are on the verge of defeat, are bent on spreading canards," Modi said, attacking Congress and NCP.
"The Congress-NCP government destroyed an entire generation in Maharashtra in the last 15 years. No jobs to youth and no security to women, these are their deeds. Farmers committed suicide, despite their (Congress-NCP) being in power in the state and the Centre," he said.
Shouldn't those responsible for deaths of farmers be punished? Will you punish them? Will you vote for lotus and wipe the corrupt? he asked the people. "Congress nationalised banks over 40 years ago. Then, Congress leaders said the money in banks should be used for poor. But I want to ask my tribal and poor friends, have you seen a poor person in banks," Modi said.
"We have implemented the PM Jandhan Yojana so that the bank money should be used for poor," he stressed. "I don't have to snap photos in huts to show I care for the poor. I have come from amidst the poor," Modi said.
"We have two doctor MPs (Dhule MP Dr Subhas Bhamre and Nandurbar MP Dr Heena Gavit) here, so the disease of poverty will go away," he told the crowd, beginning his speech in Marathi.

PTI
Jothi Ramalingam “Warning...immediately release people’s Chief Minister Amma...otherwise we will hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu as hostages,”says the huge poster put up in certain locations in south Chennai.

A wall poster put out by an expelled AIADMK party man here threatening Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu if the convicted party supremo J. Jayalalithaa was not released from jail created a flutter and the party sought to distance from the row.
The party said the poster was put on display without its sanction and stressed that it stood committed to the welfare for all sections of people, a party functionary said here.

Osamas body dropped into sea with 300 pounds of iron chains’Osama’s body dropped into sea with 300 pounds of iron chains’

Washington, Oct 7:  
After al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. special forces in Pakistan’s garrison town of Abbottabad, his body was kept in a heavy black bag of 300 pounds of iron chain and dropped into the sea, former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said.
After Osama was shot dead, Panetta said, as planned the body of the world’s most wanted terrorist was transported by marines flying an Osprey to waiting aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson for his burial by sea.
“Bin Laden’s body was prepared for burial according to Muslim traditions, draped in a white shroud, given final prayers in Arabic, and then placed inside a heavy black bag,” Panetta wrote in his latest book ‘Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace’ which hit the book stores today.
“Three hundred pounds of iron chains were put inside as well, to ensure that the body would sink,” he wrote.
“The bagged body was placed on a white table at the rail of the ship; the table was tipped over to drop the body into the sea. It was so heavy that it dragged the table in with it.
As the body sank quickly out of sight, the table bobbed on the surface,” Panetta said, without identifying the location.

Modi is leaving his work to hold rallies in Maharashtra: Shiv SenaPrime Minister Narendra Modi
Mumbai, Oct 7:  
Launching a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Shiv Sena today said he is leaving his work in Delhi to hold rallies in Maharashtra and questioned the work done by him for the state after becoming the Prime Minister.
The Sena also told its estranged ally BJP that frequent visits of the Prime Minister for the campaign was denting the State’s coffers.
“The Prime Minister is busy addressing rallies in Maharashtra leaving his work in Delhi. Modi is a tall leader of the BJP but he has been forced to campaign in the State since the BJP has no known faces in Maharashtra,” the Sena said in its editorial mouthpiece ‘Saamana’
If Modi was a “superstar campaigner” as projected by the BJP, he would have appealed to people of the State to vote for his party while sitting in New Delhi, it said.
“If Modi had a mass appeal as projected by the BJP, he (Modi) instead of conducting 25-30 campaigns in different parts of Maharashtra, would have sat in Delhi and appealed for votes and people would have definitely listened to him,” the Sena organ said.
“When some rogue elements had threatened to disrupt the annual Amarnath yatra, Balasaheb Thackeray had challenged them while sitting in Mumbai. The rogue elements never dared to hurt the pilgrims then,” it said.
NCP chief Sharad Pawar and MNS chief Raj Thackeray have been questioning Modi’s obsession with Gujarat inspite of him being the Prime Minister, and they have only given words to what the Shiv Sena felt (about Modi), it further said.
“It does not suit a Prime Minister to wander from village to village asking for votes...The dignity of the PM’s chair should be upheld,” the editorial said.
The Sena also questioned the work done by Modi for Maharashtra after becoming the PM, and said it is ironical that they (BJP) have suddenly found love for Maratha warrior king Shivaji.
The Sena also said that the burden of the visits was falling on the State’s treasury.
“Whenever the Prime Minister is invited to conduct rallies, many things need to be taken care of. His security and other arrangements need money, the burden of which finally falls on the shoulders of the State treasury. When Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh used the state machinery previously, they were severely criticised,” it said.

Impressed by Modis commitment to fighting poverty: Bill GatesImpressed by Modi’s commitment to fighting poverty: Bill Gates
PTI
Tweet
New York, Oct 7:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment to improve health services and his focus on ending open defecation has “impressed” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates who said it is “inspiring” to see India move to the forefront of providing such services to the underprivileged.
“Modi has India talking about toilets...This is not the kind of issue that most politicians like to talk about. But I would guess that in the short time he has been in office, Prime Minister Modi has done more to raise the awareness of the need for toilets than any other leader since the country gained independence,” Gates said in a blog post titled ’Meeting the New Prime Minister.’
In the blog, Gates writes about his meeting with Modi in New Delhi last month when he and his wife Melinda focussed on toilets, vaccines, bank accounts and health clinics in their “more than an hour” long discussions.
“We came away impressed by his commitment to fighting poverty and improving health for India’s poorest people,” Gates said.
“This is an exciting time, not just for India, but for everyone who cares about giving the poorest people a chance to lead healthy, productive lives. With all the attention and innovation going on in these areas - from health to financial services - we have a fantastic opportunity to make an impact.
It’s inspiring to see India moving to the forefront of these efforts,” he said.
Gates said Modi “made it clear” that he is “frustrated” with the slow pace of improvement in expanding and improving sanitation services across the country.
Modi, who wants to end open defecation by 2019, shared with the billionaire couple few of his ideas, including installing toilets in bus and rail stations in 500 towns.
Gates said Modi has been “quite outspoken” on open defecation, a subject one hears much less about.
“It may seem surprising when you think about all the innovation coming out of India, but 630 million people there defecate in the open because they don’t have access to a commode. Worldwide, the number is 2.5 billion people,” he said, adding that creating good sanitation options for people is a big focus of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.
Gates discussed with the Indian leader the opportunity to design 21st century toilets that do not need big sewage systems and water treatment plants.
He praised Modi for being “generous” with his time with them even though his office was busy with the visit of Chinese President Xi Jingping and the floods in Jammu and Kashmir.
“Judging from our time there, it sounds like he’s setting aggressive goals and pushing people to get them done quickly.
He’s having a lot of intense meetings with various ministers, asking them, ‘What can you do in 100 days? Can you make your goals more concrete? More ambitious?’,” Gates wrote.

Dismissing the bail pleas filed by Jayalalithaa and three of her associates, Justice A V Chandrashekhar said the Supreme Court had in recent times taken a tough stand against corruption cases and had called “corruption a violation of human rights’’.
Although Special Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said he had no objections to bail being granted, the High Court bench referred to recent Supreme Court orders in corruption cases and ruled against Jayalalithaa’s plea. Initially, after Singh’s turnaround, word trickled out of the courtroom that Jayalalithaa had been granted bail, leading to celebrations by AIADMK supporters who had gathered outside.
“In view of the clear observation of the apex court that corruption is a violation of human rights, this is not a fit case for suspension and bail. Bail plea is liable to be dismissed,’’ said the court. It observed that there were no grounds to suspend her sentence. Though it is true that the sentence can be suspended in cases where it is seven years or less, it is not an absolute right, the court said.
The apex court has created a framework for addressing corruption cases in the course of the State of Maharashtra through CBI, Anti Corruption Branch, Mumbai Vs. Balakrishna Dattatrya Kumbhar case where it stated that “corruption is a serious malady affecting the health of the polity,’’ the bench observed.
The judge said Jayalalithaa’s case was not one without evidence, although there could be reason for argument on evidence that could be taken up at the stage of an appeal. The court cited a Supreme Court observation that conviction after a trial means a person is assumed to be corrupt till exonerated by a higher court.
A conviction by a sessions court is a disqualification against suspension of sentence since the court has applied its mind in the course of the trial, the bench said. The mere fact that the accused was on bail in the course of the 13-year trial of the case and did not violate bail conditions does not warrant a suspension of sentence and grant of bail, it said.
Senior advocate Ram Jethmalani, counsel for Jayalalithaa, said the special judge had committed several perversions in the trial and had proceeded in the case with the assumption that the prosecution had proved its case.
Senior advocate Amit Desai, appearing for V K Sasikala, said the special judge had “virtually reversed the first principles of jurisprudence’’ by putting the onus on the accused continued…

Phelps suspended for six months after DUI arrestAug 10, 2014; Irvine, CA, USA; Michael Phelps reacts after placing second in the …
By Steve Ginsburg
REUTERS - American swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, was suspended for six months by USA Swimming on Monday following his recent arrest on a drunken driving charge.
Phelps, who recently returned to top-level competition after a two-year retirement, will also not be allowed to represent the United States at the 2015 FINA World Swimming Championships in Russia next August, USA Swimming said in a statement.
The arrest last Tuesday marked the second time the 29-year-old Baltimore-area native had been arrested for drunken driving, the first being in 2004. In the first case, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving while impaired in exchange for 18 months' probation.
"Membership in USA Swimming, and particularly at the National Team level, includes a clear obligation to adhere to our Code of Conduct," USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus said in a statement.
"Should an infraction occur, it is our responsibility to take appropriate action based on the individual case. Michael’s conduct was serious and required significant consequences."
Phelps was arrested last week after speeding and then crossing the double-lane lines inside a Baltimore tunnel, police said, adding he was clocked by radar traveling 84 miles per hour (135 kph) in a 45-mph (72-kph) zone.
Documents indicate that Phelps registered .14 percent on a Breathalyzer test after being pulled over in his 2014 Land Rover. The legal limit for intoxication in Maryland is .08.
Phelps apologized for the incident and said on Sunday he was checking himself into rehab for six weeks in order to "better understand myself."
'ACCEPTS SANCTIONS'
He can train with his member club during his suspension, but is ineligible to participate in USA Swimming-sanctioned competitions through March 6, 2015. Phelps, who has won 22 Olympic medals, 18 of them gold, will also forfeit a monthly stipend from USA Swimming during the six-month suspension.
"Michael accepts USA Swimming's sanctions," said a spokesman at Octagon, the group that represents Phelps. "He has apologized for his actions and, as he shared yesterday, is taking steps to address them."
Although he has not indicated a desire to compete at the 2016 Olympics, many view Phelps' recent return to the pool as a clear sign he wants to stage a comeback.
Dara Torres, a 12-time Olympic medalist, said she believed Phelps could still make the U.S. squad for Rio de Janeiro.
"I don't think the suspension is going to affect him physically, because they're not saying he can't train. He just can't compete," Torres, a former teammate of Phelps, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
"He can still stay in shape and he knows what to expect and how to compete. It's not like he's starting something new."
Wielgus said: "Michael has publicly acknowledged the impact of his decisions, his accountability especially due to his stature in the sport and the steps necessary for self-improvement. We endorse and are here to fully support his personal development actions."

BlackBerry Passport: Packed with innovation and powerThe BlackBerry Passport is meant for high-end power users
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: October 3, 2014 4:02 pm | Updated: October 4, 2014 9:53 am
Very gutsy, BlackBerry, very gutsy indeed. Just when the world thought the company from Waterloo had no chance of reviving its handset business, BlackBerry has come up with the Passport. And it is a huge gamble, given that this phone has a very unique form factor and is not meant to sell in volumes. However, BlackBerry is convinced that this phone will help it retain its core clientele and maybe even win some new fans. I am tempted to agree.
Quick Tech Specs: 4.5-inch IPS display (1440 x 1440 pixels, 453 ppi) | 2.26 GHz Krait 400 quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor | 3GB RAM | 32 GB storage + microSD slot up to 128 GB | 13MP rear camera, 2MP front camera, 1080p Full HD video | 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 | 3450mAh battery | BlackBerry OS 10.3
Price: Rs 49,990
It is exactly the size of a passport. My passport on top of the BlackBerry passport (Source: Nandagopal Rajan)
Design: I actually saw a couple of reports calling this a square phone, which it is not. In fact, it is the same size as any passport. It has a square display and a three-row keypad below it, which means it cannot be square. It is a large phone. So much so that the phone that comes closest to this size is the LG Optimus Vu. But despite being large the phone fits into your pocket, and that seems to have been a conscious design decision. You can easily grip the phone in one hand, but this is not made for single-handed operation. After all, there is no rulebook that says a phone must. Anyway, BlackBerry is on a rule-breaking spree here.
Just below the display is the large keypad that lets you type better than on any keypad seen in a phone before, older BlackBerry’s included. But then there are no physical number keys and you have to use the touch screen to make a call. There is a reinforced stainless steel frame that at the core of this phone, giving it a very solid feel. You don’t have to worry if this phone will bend, though you will have to take good care of the extra-large screen. The design is minimalist and there is just the power button on top and the volume keys on the right flanking the voice assist key. The nano-SIM and SD card go behind the flap, but the battery is not removable.
Display: Yes, this is a very different display size. But that means you will never have to flip the orientation of the phone to do anything. It gives more than 60 characters in a line and Excel continued…

Stocks: Time to let your inner cat out of the bag0
On the bright side, it might seem that investors aren't making their usual mistake of buying high by jumping into the market once it's overheated and headed for a fall, after they already panicked and sold low by bailing during the recession. Of course, that's like congratulating yourself for not jumping in the bay after the ship has sailed. And, according to Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment officer of portfolio strategies for U.S. wealth management at Merrill Lynch, playing it safe this time is likely to be another big mistake.
With bond yields in the dumps and cash paying practically nothing while the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low, "The only other option is equities," Bartel says. "We believe that we've entered a new secular bull market."
A secular bull market means a long-term, overall run-up in stocks, as opposed to the cyclical bucking bulls that give stocks their usual ups and downs. During the last big secular bull run from 1983 to 2000, the Dow gained more than 900 percent. But that doesn't mean that Wall Street has turned into a one-way street, Bartel warns.
"It doesn't mean there won't be a bear market," Bartel says. "Markets will go down at some point by 20 percent to 30 percent. When we go through that, clients can be unnerved."
Bear with the bear
That's what happened on Black Monday in October 1987, when the market recorded its biggest one-day drop. Stocks turned right around, however, and investors were back in the black 20 months later. Investors can expect the same thing as this secular market -- which some analysts say could last for 15 years -- goes through the normal cyclical ups and downs.
For investors, it means realizing that the best bet for long-term growth still is in stocks, but that they should have a diversified strategy that focuses not on beating the market, but on the returns they need from all their investments to hit their goals, while taking no more risk than is necessary.
"It's important to know why you're invested where you're invested," Bartel says.
Which brings us to another old saying (though not from Mark Twain), that when it comes to the market, bulls can make money, bears can make money, but pigs gets slaughtered. And, for all the frightened felines out there, I'll add this: scaredy-cats starve.

Where was respect for Balasaheb when BJP broke alliance: SenaPrint
MUMBAI: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would not criticise Shiv Sena out of respect for its founder Bal Thackeray, the former saffron ally hit back saying where was the respect when the 25-year-old alliance was broken over seat-sharing for the upcoming Maharastra Assembly polls.
An editorial in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna said: 'Modi said he won't say a word against Sena as a tribute to Bal Thackeray. We appreciate that. But what happened to that  respect while you were breaking off the alliance?'
The editorial further went on to say if the BJP had shown some maturity in seat sharing and held the alliance together, then that would have been a true tribute to Bal Thackeray.
"We are happy to learn that he (Modi) has respect for Balasaheb in his heart... Then why did the Bharatiya Janata Party break the 25-year-old alliance in Maharashtra?" the Sena asked in an editorial in its mouthpiece "Saamana".
It said the strong ties built on Hindutva started by Bal Thackeray were snapped only on the issue of seat sharing in the Maharashtra assembly elections.
The Sena also took potshots at BJP leaders for proclaiming their love for Chhatrapati Shivaji though they had never celebrated his anniversary once in their lifetime.
"This is a sheer insult, and even Chhatrapati Shivaji's soul must be getting distressed in Raigad Fort (the site of his Samadhi memorial)," the Sena said.
The Sena also took umbrage at Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel's invitation to businesses in Maharashtra to shift to Gujarat.
"The Congress-NCP looted Maharashtra... The BJP is casting a covetous eye on Maharashtra's resources... Such a statement (by Patel) also tantamounts to looting.
"The people of the state are well aware of the hidden looters who speak one thing and do another," the editorial said.
Addressing election rallies in poll bound Maharashtra on Sunday, Modi said: 'I have decided not to say a single word against Shiv Sena. It is my way of respecting Balasaheb Thackeray's memory. Our bond with Shiv Sena goes beyond politics.'
Trying to appease the Sena for snapping ties, Modi went on to say: 'These are first (state) elections to take place in the absence of the late Balasaheb Thackeray-ji. He was the man who always stood for the rights of the people, I will not disrespect his memory.'
Training guns on the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party, who also parted ways, he accused them of misusing the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji. "I ask them, who named the Mumbai Airport after Chhatrapati Shivaji? It was the Atal Behari Vajpayee government at the Centre," he said.
He charged Congress-NCP of rampant corruption during their 15-year-long reign in Maharashtra and alleged that they did not even spare homes meant for Kargil widows, in a reference to the Adarsh Society scam in Mumbai.
Modi who is one of the star campaigners of the party for Maharashtra which is going to polls on October 15 held three rallies in the state at Sangli, Kolhapur and Gondiya on Sunday.
Modi is expected to address 20 rallies in nine days around the state.

Global Steel Consumption to Grow at Slower Pace in 2014  2015: WSADDA Housing Scheme: Draw to be Held on Tuesday
Moscow: Global steel consumption is likely to grow at a slower pace than previously expected in 2014 and next year, the World Steel Association told its conference on Monday.
"The positive momentum in global steel demand seen in the second half of 2013 abated in 2014 with weaker than expected performance in the emerging and developing economies," Hans Jurgen Kerkhoff, the association's Committee chairman, said.
The association said global apparent steel use was now expected to rise 2.0 per cent, year-on-year, to 1.562 billion tonnes in 2014, down from growth of 3.8 per cent in 2013 and below a previous forecast for 3.1 per cent growth.
Global steel use was also forecast to rise 2.0 per cent in 2015 to 1.594 billion tonnes, it said, down from a previous forecast for 3.3 per cent growth.
"The slowdown in China's steel demand reflecting the structural transformation of the economy has contributed significantly to our lower global growth projection," Kerkhoff added.
The association also pointed to a major slowdown in South America and the CIS countries due to falling commodity prices, structural constraints and geopolitical tensions.
The crisis in Ukraine has plunged ties between Russia and the West, which backs Kiev, to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War.

The dog that wouldnt dieOZARK, Alabama, October 7, 2014

The dog that wouldn’t die
AP
AP Lazarus, a mixed-breed dog who survived a euthanasia attempt and a car accident, sits by his new owner, Jane Holston, in Alabama.
TOPICS
USA
Animal control officer Wanda Snell knows what she saw: a veterinarian inserted a needle into the black-and-brown mutt and injected a chemical meant to euthanise the dog no one had adopted. The animal moved a bit and was still and quiet by the time she left the shelter for home.
What Ms. Snell can’t explain is how a mixed-breed dog that nobody wanted recovered overnight and has since bounced back from what should have been a lethal injection.
A rescue worker who retrieved the roughly 4-year-old male dog after the failed procedure named him “Lazarus” after the man the Bible says Jesus brought back to life. Records show the dog arrived at the shelter on Aug. 19 after being dropped off by its owner, who could no longer care for it.
The animal was cut and bloody after being struck by a car and a pad on its left rear foot was missing. Shelter volunteer Cortney Blankenship tried to find a rescue home through social media, but no one stepped up to adopt. So the dog’s scheduled date with death arrived on Sept. 10.
Ms. Snell said she witnessed the entire euthanisation procedure. The dog moved a bit when injected, almost as if fighting the drug before it quieted and was still.
But when Ms. Snell arrived for work the next morning, she saw the dog standing in an outdoor pen linked to the interior kennel. The dog had walked out and helped himself to some water.
Dr. Robert Lofton of the veterinary school at Auburn University said such cases are rare. While he hasn’t examined the dog and wasn’t involved in its handling, Lofton said the dog’s survival could have resulted from an improper dose of the drug used or possibly a vein that dodged the needle tip.
The animal has now been claimed by another rescue group leader who turned it over to a family that has adopted him.

Gold Holds Above $1,200, But Bearish Sentiment Prevails
Reuters | Updated On: October 07, 2014 08:52 (IST)
Gold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
Singapore: Gold held above $1,200 an ounce on Tuesday, retaining most of its sharp overnight gains following a bout of profit-taking in the dollar, but optimism over the US economy and possibility of higher rates kept investors wary.
Spot gold slipped slightly to $1,203.30 an ounce by 0249 GMT. It had jumped 1.3 per cent on Monday in its biggest one-day gain in two months as physical buyers and bargain hunters lent support following earlier lows.
The metal is still not too far from a low of $1,183.46 reached earlier on Monday - its weakest since June 2013 - as a strong US jobs report dented its safe-haven appeal.
"The bounce is temporary and gold will likely go lower in the next couple of months," said ANZ analyst Victor Thianpiriya.
"The dollar has gone a long way very quickly, so we are seeing some profit taking. But the overall trend for the dollar is to continue to rally, so that will put downward pressure on gold," he said.
The dollar was beginning to show signs of stabilisation on Tuesday, gaining slightly against a basket of major currencies after a near 1 per cent drop in the previous session.
The dollar index has gained for the past 12 consecutive weeks and hit a more than four-year high on Friday after a strong US jobs report.
More robust economic data could boost the dollar and reiterate expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise US interest rates in mid-2015, a move that would hurt non-interest-bearing assets such as gold.
"Technically, if the $1,180 level can hold this week, then gold looks likely to push back up to the $1,240-$1,250 region," said James Gardiner, metals trader at MKS Group said. "However, the medium-long term bias is still towards the downside."
Markets were also eyeing the return of Chinese buyers on Wednesday. China, the top buyer of gold, has been away since the beginning of the month for its National Day holiday.
Strong buying from China could potentially boost prices.
Among other precious metals, silver slipped 0.2 per cent, tracking gold. Platinum and palladium jumped for a second straight day.

The number of people killed in crashes caused by General Motors' defective ignition switches is 24 as of Friday, according to updated figures released today.
GM victim fund chief Ken Feinberg said he has certified two dozen people as eligible for settlements, one more than a week ago. He has received applications from 165 families claiming to have lost a loved one in an accident caused by malfunctioning ignition switches, up from 153 a week ago.
The number of people who will receive compensation for serious injuries or minor injuries remained steady at four and 12, respectively.
Feinberg said he's now received applications from 79 people claiming to have suffered serious injuries and 886 saying they had minor injuries.
That brings the total number of applications for injury and death compensation to 1,130
GM has recalled 2.6 million small cars — primarily from between 2003 and 2007 model years to replace the ignition switches — which can turn off when jostled, cutting off power to the engine, air bags and power steering and brake assist.
Feinberg said he's still evaluating applications that have not been certified for compensation, or he's requesting more documentation to verify their eligibility.
Families of people who died will get at least $1 million. Feinberg, who ran the 9/11 victim compensation fund and the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill fund, is accepting applications through Dec. 31.
GM initially said the number of people who died in accidents blamed on the ignition switch was at least 13, but that figure was expected to rise as more victims came forward.
The faulty switches were installed in Chevrolet Cobalts and HHRs, Saturn Ions and Skys, and Pontiac G5s, mostly from the 2003 through 2007 model years.
Feinberg has spelled out criteria for eligibility at GMIgnitionCompensation.com. If he determines the defect was the "substantial cause" of the accident, he will use actuarial tables and medical cost data to calculate the size of a payout.

BSE Sensex falls in early trade on weak Asian cuesSensex tumbles to 2-month low, down 296 points on capital outflows

BSE benchmark Sensex on Tuesday plunged 296 points to close at nearly two-month low due to widespread losses in metal, healthcare, consumer durables and capital goods sector stocks on capital outflows and retail investors ahead of earnings season amid a mixed trend overseas.
After opening 137 points lower, the 30-share index continued its slide to touch the day's low of 26,250.24 before ending the day at almost two-month low of 26,271.97, a level not seen since August 14, registering a steep fall of 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
The gauge had lost 62.52 points in the previous session on October 1. Stock markets remained closed on October 2, 3 and 6 for Gandhi Jayanti, Dussehra and Id-Ul-Zuha, respectively.
FII/FPIs pulled out Rs 63.24 crore from domestic markets on October 1, according to exchange data.
Similarly, the broader-based NSE Nifty closed down by 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent at 7,852.40 after shuttling between 7,943.05 and 7,842.70.
Brokers said the sentiment dampened on foreign capital outflows and offloading of positions by retail investors ahead of the earnings season, with Infosys posting results later this week.
Of the 30 Sensex shares, 23 closed lower led by Hindalco (down 4.35 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (4.32 per cent) and Cipla (3.67 per cent), while NTPC, Gail and Tata Motors remained major gainers.
Globally, a mixed closing on the other Asian markets and a lower opening of the European stocks as a report showed German industrial production contracted the most in more than five years, also negatively impacted sentiment. Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 63.24 crore last Wednesday as per the provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
Sectorwise, BSE metal index suffered the most by falling 2.65 per cent, followed by healthcare by 1.85 per cent. Captial goods index by 1.78 per cent, Consumer durables index by 1.72 per cent, Realy index 1.27 per cent, PSU index 1.20 per cent and Banking index 0.87 per cent.

IndiGo posts 6th straight yr of profit | M&M to buy Peugeot scooter bizIndiGo’s FY14 profit more than halves to Rs 317 crore against Rs 787 crore

(The carrier has reported…)
MUMBAI: Budget carrier IndiGo's net profit for FY14 fell 60% as unfavourable industry conditions such as weak demand and intense competition combined with weak currency to hurt performance after six straight years of robust profit growth.
ndia's biggest carrier by market share posted an annual net profit of Rs 317 crore for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, compared with Rs 787 crore a year earlier, according to annual statements filed with the registrar of companies.
Revenue rose 18% to Rs 11,117 crore.
IndiGo's CEO and president Aditya Ghosh confirmed the airline has filed the results but didn't elaborate. The airline's peers commended its performance. "Good business model, solid execution, well done!" Sanjiv Kapoor, chief operating officer of rival budget carrier SpiceJet told ET. "The airline made some solid scale bets early on which are paying off well," he added.
But the numbers fell short of some analysts' estimates.
"Our outlook released in April 2014 estimated Rs 350 crore- Rs 400 crore net profit for FY14. The results reflect a very tough operating environment in FY14 which was the worst performing fiscal for the industry," said Kapil Kaul, south Asia CEO at Sydney-based consultant CAPA-Center for Aviation.
The rupee suffered a free fall against the dollar last year, dropping to record lows in August. About 70% of IndiGo's expenses are in dollars, but due to limited international operations it gets far less than 15% of its revenue in the same currency, according to analysts' estimates.
The slow down in air travel also continued. Indian carriers flew 61 million local passengers between April and March, up just 5% on year. To fill planes, airlines led by SpiceJet introduced massive discounts since January. India has the cheapest air fares in the world while being saddled with one of the highest cost burdens, mainly jet fuel.
The low fares in Jan-March impacted overall yields for IndiGo.
Its annual revenue per average seat kilometre fell to 3.70 from 3.78 the previous year, the figures showed.
The airline annually carried 16% more passengers than the previous year, but increased capacity by 20%.
IndiGo is believed to have got massive discounts on its past two aircraft orders of 100 and 180 planes. It has been selling the aircraft to lessors at huge premiums, adding considerably to profits.
Kaul said that IndiGo would have earned Rs 350 crore from sale and leaseback of planes last year, but the benefits were offset by unfavourable market conditions.
The airline however continues to be way ahead of its peers.
SpiceJet posted a record net loss of over Rs 1,003 crore during FY14 while the other listed carrier Jet Airways lost Rs 3,667 crore. Unlisted airline Go Air reportedly made a net profit of Rs 50 crore, a figure its spokesman didn't confirm.
Despite the fall, IndiGo's consistent profitability in a bleeding industry will strengthen sentiments for its imminent initial public offer, likely planned for the middle of next year, said experts.
"With its low costs, efficiency and reliability of operations, IndiGo has clearly demonstrated its business strengths. Investor confidence will only be boosted by its latest profit figures" said Prithvi Haldea, founder chairman of Prime Database, a tracker of primary markets.
CAPA has estimated a valuation of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for the airline.
IndiGo has appointed seven banks Citigroup , Deutsche Bank , JP Morgan , UBS , Standard Chartered , Morgan Stanley and Kotak Mahindra for the offer. It may file its prospectus by February, said a source close to the development.

Do you want to know if a company’s earnings will be good or bad? Of course you do. And this one simple trick, discovered by a doctor, will help you do it.
Michael Probst, AP
No, really. The doctor in question, Eric So, holds a doctorate in business administration from Stanford, so he’s someone you should listen to in financial matters. And the simple trick really is pretty simple.
The indicator you should watch: Whether or not a company changes its earnings reporting date, and whether than change moves the date forwards or backwards.
Not surprisingly, if the date moves up, the news is usually good. If it moves back? Probably not good. Professor So, who is the Sarofim Family Career Development Professor and an assistant professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. says the simple rule is human nature. People rush home to tell their families good news, and tend to keep quiet about bad news.
Professor So looked at eight years’ of earnings announcements – 19,000 firms between 2006 and 2013. Firms that move up their announcements earn 2.6% more than the firms that delay announcements over the month following earnings calendar revisions.  “The magnitude of this mispricing is massive,” So said in a statement.
He said he believes that investors overlook the significance of the date shifting because it is typically announced as a simple calendar listing. “It comes across as a boilerplate disclosure that doesn’t appear to contain information about the nature of the news, only when the news is to be announced,” he said.

The owner of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC is expected to report disappointing third-quarter earnings due to a  sharp fall in sales in China  (paywall). Like McDonald’s, which reported a similar decline last month, Yum has fallen prey to a string of Chinese food-quality scandals.
The Nobel Prize in physics. Every winner of this prestigious award since 1963 has been a man—a fact that’s rightly rubbing some people the wrong way . One survey says that this year’s winners will likely be a group of (male) scientists who researched materials that could be used for quantum computers .
Ukraine and Russia address their gas dispute—perhaps. Winter is coming, which means Ukraine needs the gas that Russia stopped delivering in June . The two countries are due to report back to the European Commission , which has been overseeing  negotiations aimed at finding a solution.
More economic data than you know what to do with. The IMF will publish its global economic outlook , the Bank of Portugal will disclose the state of local banks, and the US will issue an update on  its oil stockpile .

Samsung’s profits dropped like a stone. The South Korean tech giant said its third-quarter operating profits will fall by 60% to 4.1 trillion won ($3.8 billion) —even worse than most analysts expected—due to intense competition in the smartphone market, which is eating away at the company’s market share and forcing heavy discounting and marketing expenditures.
ISIL fighters reached the streets of Kobani. The Islamic State raised its flag  inside the Syrian border town near the Turkish border after a lengthy siege. Syrian Kurds say are woefully outgunned, and warn that “a terrible slaughter is coming” if ISIL takes the city.
Glencore tried to merge with Rio Tinto. The Anglo-Swiss mining company approached Rio Tinto this summer with a merger proposal that would have created the world’s largest mining company,  but was turned down in August . Glencore is now gauging Aluminium Corporation of China’s interest in a deal; the state-owned company controls 9.8% of Rio Tinto.
Brussels is going after Amazon. The European Commission will launch a formal investigation into the tax relationship between the online retailer and Luxembourg, according to the Financial Times  (paywall). Brussels alleges Luxembourg improperly offered Amazon preferential tax rates for a decade, in a deal similar to those that have ensnared Apple in Ireland and Starbucks in the Netherlands.
Ebola infected someone outside of Africa for the first time. A female nurse in Madrid  tested positive for the disease , after working in a hospital there that was treating an Ebola victim. All the previous victims, including  Thomas Eric Duncan,  have contracted the disease in Africa.

US faces massive military test from China: B...Bobby Jindal
(Indian-American Louisiana…)
WASHINGTON: Indian-American Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, has lashed out at Chinese military buildup, saying the US today faces the greatest military challenge from China.
"In terms of traditional military power, the greatest challenge facing the United States is China. For the past nearly 20 years, China has engaged in a massive military buildup," Jindal said in a major policy paper in defense which he co-authored with the former US Senator Jim Talent.
In the paper presented yesterday, he outlined his vision, that he says will save the American military from damage done by President Barack Obama.
"The Chinese regime, for nationalistic, political, and economic reasons, is seeking a sphere of influence -- a kind of hegemony -- in the East and South China Seas, and wants the option of using coercion to achieve their ends," Jindal said.
"For that reason, they are purposefully and relentlessly developing the capabilities to exclude American forces from the region," said Jindal, the first Indian-American Governor of a US State.
"The primary target of China's military buildup is the US," he said. "It would be wrong to view China as necessarily an enemy of the United States. China is a rising power with a proud history; it is natural that the Chinese would seek to dominate their region of the world," he added.
"The means by which the Chinese will use to achieve it are unacceptable to the US and its allies. America is bound by treaty to defend Japan and the Philippines, and has guaranteed de facto the territorial integrity of Taiwan," he said.
The United States, he said, has a vital interest in freedom of trade and travel for all nations in the East and South China Seas, and in the peaceful resolution of disputes among nations according to international norms, he added.
"Certainly, the Chinese understand that their national ambitions are bringing them into conflict with the United States; that is precisely why they are building up their power -- and doing so at such a rapid pace," Jindal said.
Jindal said the Obama Administration's 'Asia Pacific Rebalance' initiative is failing for lack of power.
"Nowhere else is the decline in America's military more dangerous than in East Asia," he said, adding the US simply does not have the forces to shift into the region and our potential allies and partners are reluctant to align themselves given America's growing weakness.
"The balance of power in East Asia is changing; China will be, if it is not already, dominant in the region. If that happens, the 'rebalance' policy may prove very dangerous -- it effectively makes the US the obstacle to China's ambitions without effectively deterring them, thereby creating an environment of rising tension and possible conflict,"he said.

AIADMK men get their heads tonsured in Amma support
The former Tamil Nadu chief minister's followers performed special pujas and organised an all-faith prayer meeting in front of the Bangalore Central Jail where she has been lodged.

BENGALURU: AMMA supporters are now seeking divine intervention for her release. With the hearing on J. Jayalalithaa's plea coming up before the Karnataka High Court on Tuesday, the former Tamil Nadu chief minister's followers on Monday performed special pujas, tonsured their heads and organised an all-faith prayer meeting in front of the Bangalore Central Jail where she has been lodged.
The 'show of strength' baffled the local police, who were caught unawares by the sudden surge of crowd. More than 100 followers of Jayalalithaa tonsured their heads. Local AIADMK leader K. R. Krishna Raju sponsored the event.
"We want Amma (Jayalalithaa) to be out on bail. We are confident that justice will be delivered tomorrow. When a criminal gets bail, why our Amma, who has worked for the upliftment of the poor, cannot get bail? We have faith in the judiciary as well as God," said Krishna Raju, who continued his day- long special event despite objections from the local police.
The AIADMK party workers displayed banner and placards in support of Jayalalithaa and raised slogans in her favour. According to Krishna Raju, the tonsured hair will be offered to various temples for the well- being of the former CM.
Meanwhile, an all-faith prayer meeting was held with people representing various religions praying for divine intervention in the case. In addition, special pujas were also performed outside the jail to invoke the blessings of the God in view of the bail hearing on Tuesday.
It has been more than a week since the former CM is lodged in the Bangalore Central Jail after being convicted by a special court in the Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case. The AIADMK leaders are under pressure to find legal relief for their leader.
Even kids performed puja hoping for bail for 'Amma'.
"We want to express solidarity with Amma. Today, only Karnataka cadre of AIADMK participated in this event. We are hopeful of happy news tomorrow," Krishna Raju said.
As demonstrations and unexpected protests continue outside the jail, the demand to shift Jayalalithaa from Bangalore to Tamil Nadu has intensified.
Former Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda made it clear that the state government should not spend its resources on the issue.
"Why should Karnataka government take the burden of hosting Jayalalithaa? Every day, it is becoming a law and order situation. The chief minister should seek her transfer to Tamil Nadu," he said.
AIADMK workers and Jayalalithaa followers organised all-faith prayer meeting outside Bangalore Central Jail.

Five reasons markets are sinking | Nifty below 7 900; top 20 betsSensex ends 296 points down; top 5 reasons why Indian markets are under pressure
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 7, 2014, 03.55PM IST

(As per provisional data,…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex ended nearly 300 points lower following a sharp correction in European markets. Nifty has breached 50-day DMA and further downside in the near term can't be ruled out, say analysts.
The 50-share index closed at 7,852.40, down 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent. The S&P BSE Sensex ended at 26,271.97, down 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
DLF (5.68%), NMDC (5.57%), Jindal Steel (4.92%), Hindalco (4.90%) and Sesa Sterlite (4.49%) were among the top losers.
NTPC (up 1.62%), GAIL (up 1.16%), Power Grid Corporation (up 1.07%), Tata Power (up 0.93%) and Wipro (up 0.64%) were among the Nifty gainers.
Here is a list of five possible reasons which may be responsible for the current weakness in the markets:
Profit booking by FIIs:
Foreign institutional investors, which were largely responsible for an over 25 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex, have become net sellers of Indian equities in the last five trading sessions.
As per provisional data, FIIs have sold net of Rs 2583.95 in the last five trading sessions, while DIIs or domestic institutional investors remain net buyers.
On a monthly basis, MFs continued to be net buyers (US$526.9mn) of Indian equities in September 2014 for the fifth month in a row.
While FII net buying continued, the run-rate has come down to US$1bn in the past two months compared to US$2.2bn in the previous five months beginning March 2014, ICICI Securities said in a report.
"There has been lull in the FII flows in the last 7 to 10 days. It is because of the volatility in the global liquidity which we have witnessed in the last 7 to 10 days," said Sanjay Dongre, Fund Manager , UTI Asset Company Pvt. Ltd.
"We have seen a bit of volatility even in the forex market where the dollar has appreciated against most of the currencies. So, once there is a bit of stability in the currency market , looking at the attractiveness of the Indian market, the flows from the FII sides are likely to continue going forward also," he added.
Caution ahead of Q2 earnings:
Infosys will be the first Sensex company to declare its results for the quarter ended September 30. The IT major will declare its second quarter numbers this Friday on the 10 October.
The month of October could be volatile as earnings will take center stage, say analysts. At present levels, there is a little margin of safety and either equities correct or earnings have to surprise on the upside, they say.
"Keeping in mind the last month closing, I broadly expect a volatile month with bias on the negative side as we have less number of trading sessions due to the festive session break, but a lot more depends upon how the earnings season shapes up," said Ajit Mishra , AVP- Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
Arvind Sanger , Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management , said this quarter earnings are not going to have any meaningful benefit from Modi's election or anything else that has happened since then.
Slowdown in Europe/China:
Dwindling demand cut factory activity across much of Asia and Europe in September, sending it to multi-month lows and raising the chances that global growth will slow in the months ahead.
Despite gentler price rises, China's figures were mired barely above contraction, Britain slumped, and the drop in new orders did not even spare Germany , the strongest member of the euro zone currency bloc, or France, its No. 2 economy , Reuters reported.
Euro zone factories' final September PMI was 50.3, a further slackening in pace and its lowest reading since July last year, as new orders contracted for the first time in more than a year, added the report.
"The global trend, that has been a little bit of a risk off, is that Europe is in a recession and things are not getting any better. The Ukraine and Russia tensions are continuing, casting some stress on the European economy, and with China weakness there is a little bit of nervousness about the risk off on a global basis," said Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management.
"So, there has been some sell off in India and elsewhere. We could always have something go off the rails, but barring any major upheavals on a global basis, the market will continue to consolidate and for it to go much lower, it would take some more global negative cues," he added.
Lack of Big-Bang Reforms by Modi Government:
The S&P BSE Sensex closed on a muted note, down 56 points, for the month of September. Domestic issues such as coal block de-allocation and fading hopes of a rate hike in 2015 have kept the markets under pressure.
September 2014 was marked by three high-level bilateral engagements by India's PM -- with Japan, China and the US -- aimed at improving trade and diplomatic relations.
These engagements are expected to improve India's visibility in the global arena, especially amongst EMs.

NTPC (up 1.62%), GAIL (up 1.16%), Power Grid Corporation (up 1.07%), Tata Power (up 0.93%) and Wipro (up 0.64%) were among the Nifty gainers.
Here is a list of five possible reasons which may be responsible for the current weakness in the markets:
Profit booking by FIIs:
Foreign institutional investors, which were largely responsible for an over 25 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex, have become net sellers of Indian equities in the last five trading sessions.
As per provisional data, FIIs have sold net of Rs 2583.95 in the last five trading sessions, while DIIs or domestic institutional investors remain net buyers.
On a monthly basis, MFs continued to be net buyers (US$526.9mn) of Indian equities in September 2014 for the fifth month in a row.
While FII net buying continued, the run-rate has come down to US$1bn in the past two months compared to US$2.2bn in the previous five months beginning March 2014, ICICI Securities said in a report.
"There has been lull in the FII flows in the last 7 to 10 days. It is because of the volatility in the global liquidity which we have witnessed in the last 7 to 10 days," said Sanjay Dongre, Fund Manager , UTI Asset Company Pvt. Ltd.
"We have seen a bit of volatility even in the forex market where the dollar has appreciated against most of the currencies. So, once there is a bit of stability in the currency market , looking at the attractiveness of the Indian market, the flows from the FII sides are likely to continue going forward also," he added.
Caution ahead of Q2 earnings:
Infosys will be the first Sensex company to declare its results for the quarter ended September 30. The IT major will declare its second quarter numbers this Friday on the 10 October.
The month of October could be volatile as earnings will take center stage, say analysts. At present levels, there is a little margin of safety and either equities correct or earnings have to surprise on the upside, they say.
"Keeping in mind the last month closing, I broadly expect a volatile month with bias on the negative side as we have less number of trading sessions due to the festive session break, but a lot more depends upon how the earnings season shapes up," said Ajit Mishra , AVP- Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
Arvind Sanger , Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management , said this quarter earnings are not going to have any meaningful benefit from Modi's election or anything else that has happened since then.
Slowdown in Europe/China:
Dwindling demand cut factory activity across much of Asia and Europe in September, sending it to multi-month lows and raising the chances that global growth will slow in the months ahead.
Despite gentler price rises, China's figures were mired barely above contraction, Britain slumped, and the drop in new orders did not even spare Germany , the strongest member of the euro zone currency bloc, or France, its No. 2 economy , Reuters reported.
Euro zone factories' final September PMI was 50.3, a further slackening in pace and its lowest reading since July last year, as new orders contracted for the first time in more than a year, added the report.
"The global trend, that has been a little bit of a risk off, is that Europe is in a recession and things are not getting any better. The Ukraine and Russia tensions are continuing, casting some stress on the European economy, and with China weakness there is a little bit of nervousness about the risk off on a global basis," said Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management.
"So, there has been some sell off in India and elsewhere. We could always have something go off the rails, but barring any major upheavals on a global basis, the market will continue to consolidate and for it to go much lower, it would take some more global negative cues," he added.
Lack of Big-Bang Reforms by Modi Government:
The S&P BSE Sensex closed on a muted note, down 56 points, for the month of September. Domestic issues such as coal block de-allocation and fading hopes of a rate hike in 2015 have kept the markets under pressure.
September 2014 was marked by three high-level bilateral engagements by India's PM -- with Japan, China and the US -- aimed at improving trade and diplomatic relations.
These engagements are expected to improve India's visibility in the global arena, especially amongst EMs.

Indian app makers get innovative to rise above 'app poverty line'

(Traditional ways of monetising apps…)
BANGALORE: Life is tough for app developers in India. Most of them live way below the `app poverty line,' a phrase coined to describe developers earning less than $500 per app a month.
The prospects don't look good, given the reluctance of Indians to pay for apps. "I believe no one will be able to make money from apps in India in the next few years," said Alex Qian, MD for South Asia at Mobogenie, an Android app company.
Even so, developers are determined to change that perception and are finding typically Indian and innovative ways of making money or distributing apps.While some use free mobile recharges to lure customers, others sell them at stores. And Fairket, a new player, even lets you rent apps before you buy them.
Alok Kejriwal, founder of Games2Win, said that he "tried a lot of things but it didn't work". Kejriwal has discovered a new way of getting paid. His new app, Bat2Win, gives users mobile currency for winning. Players get hooked for hours and Kejriwal makes money by advertising to them. Kejriwal says the app makes close to Rs 25,000 every day. Over 64% of Android developers and 50% of iOS developers were below the app poverty line, according to the latest Developer Economics study, which surveyed over 10,000 developers across the world.
New Delhi-based Winjit Digital, which publishes mobile apps, has also been luring customers with mobile currency.The cost of acquiring a new customer this way is reasonable, said Abhishek Gureja, director of Winjit Digital.
Mobogenie, which claims 67 million installs in India, of which 2.2 million are active daily, has created virtual coins that work like real currency. Users can use those coins to purchase apps and the developer gets paid in cash, said Qian.
Traditional ways of monetising apps like charging for downloads, serving advertisements or making users purchase features or goods in the app have not worked very well in India.
"A huge number of people in India abandon downloads midway in India because of high data costs," said Manish Agarwal, CEO of Reliance Games . Another workaround is offline app distribution. Companies such as Shotformats and Appsdaily sell app bundles at physical stores that retail mobile phones. "There is awareness and appreciation but Indian consumers are wary to pay for apps," Sunil Patro, founder of SignEasy, points out.
Startup Fairket sees this as an opportunity.It lets users rent appli cations before they buy it. "We saw an opportunity here to at least move the poverty line a little bit," Muralidharan Ranga, co-founder of Fairket, said at bigmobilityconf, an app developer conference.
For the mainstream app economy to take off, the use of credit cards and the availability of easier payment methods need to get more widespread. "People don't have credit cards for in-app purchases. Last-mile payment is also an issue," said Agarwal. Appsdaily collects cash at retail stores. Large companies, including Google and startups such as NewsHunt, are working on solving the payments problem. While Google is in talks with Airtel to implement carrier billing, a method of paying using the mobile network, NewsHunt has integrated carrier billing in the app.
"India is a big area of investment for us and is growing massively," Scott Sheffer, VP, Online Partnerships Group at Google, said in an interview with ET.
As solutions like carrier billing or the ability to pay for purchases using your mobile phone get implemented, app monetisation will pick up, said Sheffer, who counts India as one of the top three fastest-growing markets for Google in Asia. Between paying for downloads, inapp purchases and advertising, which are the three dominant ways of monetising mobile apps, in-app purchases are likely to be more effective in the Indian market at a later stage, Sheffer feels.
"Indian developers are likely to begin with ad-supported models and move to in-app purchases as issues like carrier billing get resolved," said Sheffer. Data usage and use of smartphones are also in nascent stages in India. Monetisation can only come if smartphones and data pick up, said Gureja.

The outlook for international market also remains bullish with forecast of adverse weather affecting the harvest progress in most of the soybean growing regions of US. We expect a recovery in the soybean prices in the domestic front in the intraday session. A gap up is witnessed in the soybean prices and we believe the market to open upside by Rs. 40-50 in the intraday session. Moreover, the domestic market might take strong cues from the CBOT soybean and may trade on a bullish note. While, the new crops are expected to arrive in the market in the next couple of days, this might create bearishness and limit the excessive gain in the prices. Therefore, we hold a bullish view and recommend buying CBOT November soybean and NCDEX October soybean in the intraday session.

Sell USDINR below 61.80; target of 61.40: Way2Wealth
Way2Wealth has come out with its report on currencies. According to the research firm, one can sell USDINR below 61.80 for target of 61.40 with a stop loss of 62.

Way2Wealth's report on currencies
USDINR (61.93)
Although truncated but the week remained impactful for the USDINR. The US dollar hovering at its four-year high against all the currencies and the hawkish policy from RBI kept INR under pressure throughout the week. As a result, USDINR closed the week with gain of more than half a percent. As shown in the chart, in line with our view the pair reversed from 62.25 level last Wednesday to close at day’s low. This indicates that 62.25 is likely to remain a supply zone in the coming week. On the downside, 61.80 is the initial support below which the pair can drift towards 61.50.
JPYINR (56.37)
Due to lack of trading sessions and absence of triggers JPYINR again remained in a narrow range during the week. Neither the pair cleared 57 mark on the upside nor did it breached the support of 56.20. It is evident that there is hardly any change in the price structure from last week. Therefore we reiterate our view that ONLY an escape from the band will dictate the further move. In the coming sessions a move above 57.00 mark or a breach of 56.20 level might result in a harsh move of 50 – 75 bps on either side.
GBPINR (100.23)
Despite optimistic momentum in three consecutive sessions GBPINR again failed to clear the hurdle of 101 and closed the week on a flat note with marginal change. Although due to unchanged price structure the positional view is to sell the pair near current price. But the multiple resistances at 101 indicate that the pair might shoot up faster after the breakout from this stiff resistance. On the flipside, a move below 100 will bring in the expected bearish implication which can drag the pair towards 98 mark.

U.S. unemployment lowest since 2008Unemployment falls below 6% for first time since 2008
By Tami Luhby   @Luhby October 3, 2014: 11:02 AM ET
 
Unemployment rate falls below 6%
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The nation's unemployment rate fell below 6% in September for the first time in six years.
The rate came in at 5.9%, while employers added 248,000 jobs last month.
The unemployment rate fell last month because more people were getting jobs, not because they were dropping out of the labor force as they have at times during the economic recovery. The share of people in the workforce was essentially unchanged.
Jobs growth was strong in professional and business services, particularly in employment services and consulting. The retail and health care sectors, which have been a powerhouse throughout the recovery, also gained. Construction added 16,000 jobs.
Friday's report is the final one before the mid-term elections on Nov. 4. President Obama touted the strength of the economy recovery in a speech in Chicago Thursday, though he noted that most of the gains are going to the wealthy.
The president's critics , however, say the unemployment rate is declining because people are getting discourage and dropping out of the workforce entirely when they can't find jobs. The share of Americans participating in the labor force is now at its lowest point since 1978, at 62.7% .
The "drop out" factor has been a problem during the recovery, but the recent decrease in the unemployment rate, which stood at 7.2% a year ago, is due more to Americans landing jobs than giving up. Employers have added 2.6 million people to their payrolls since last September.
Related: Bank to pay everyone at least a 'living wage'
The recent hiring boost came after a surprisingly weak August, though the Department of Labor revised that month's figure upward to 180,000 jobs. Still, August was the first time figures came in below 200,000 since January. The August figures were affected by a strike at a New England grocery store chain . Workers there have now returned to work.
The consensus forecast from economists surveyed by CNNMoney was for a jobs gain of 215,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 6.1%. On average, the economy has been adding well over 200,000 jobs a month this year, a positive sign.
This jobs report is being closely followed because economic data in recent days has been mixed. Everyone from Wall Street investors to Washington powerbrokers is trying to figure out if the U.S. is truly on solid footing or likely to slide back in its recovery like Europe has.
The strong report shows that that the economy has positive momentum going into the final quarter of 2014, said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.
"It's consistent with an economy that's broadening and strengthening," he said.
Related: Help wanted: College degree not needed
A key figure to watch is whether American wages are growing. Average hourly earnings changed little last month. They are up 2% over the past 12 months, just slightly ahead of inflation, which means most U.S. workers won't feel any better off.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and other officials are closely monitoring the monthly jobs report. They are waiting for hiring to become healthy enough before raising interest rates.
The continuing softness in wage growth and inflation allows the Fed to remain patient when it comes to raising interest rates, said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics.
 
How to read the jobs report like a pro
Americans' views on hiring are mixed, however.
Gallup's U.S. Job Creation Index reached a six-year high in September, with 42% of employees surveyed saying their employer is hiring and expanding the size of its workforce. Companies are the ones adding to their payrolls, with the government sector continuing to shrink.
But others say there aren't that many job openings out there, especially for positions offering decent wages.
"It's still hard to find a good-paying job," said Jabari Jones, 32, a Forest Park, Ga., resident who said he was fortunate to recently land a $20 hourly job at Coca-Cola.
In a CNN/ORC survey released Thursday, 57% of those polled said the nation's economy was poor.

Why love is a four letter word

social issue
That many Indian women are no longer the passive bearers of caste, religious and ethnic meaning, but the makers of meaning, causes dismay among those who feel their grip is loosening
The current jihad against love — for that is indeed what has gripped the imaginative fervour of the Hindu Right and its luxuriant undergrowths and counterparts — is only the latest and most visible instance of a virulent Indian misogyny. From its beginnings in the south to its tentacular spread in the north, the thick smoke screen of “love jihad” — by which Muslim men are alleged to have designs on Hindu women of an entirely dishonourable kind — disguises a far more familiar face, one that even many Muslims will recognise. It is a deep-seated fear among many sections of Indian men that too many Indian women have taken control of their lives at a much faster pace than expected, show little patience for the strictures of the past, and therefore need to be taught a quick lesson and kept in place. What better strategy than to create a fear which will unite a seriously fractured society, and bring it back to its familiar, hierarchical whole?
Two developments
At least two sets of recent developments have stoked the fears of an Indian patriarchy that is firmly entrenched in the rich soils of religion, caste or region, and class. December 16, 2012 ended the silence of women about sexual violence and harassment in schools, colleges, workplaces, roads: angry, voluble Indian women increasingly showed no reluctance in taking journalists, slum dwellers, uncles, fathers, judges and teachers to court, or before sexual harassment committees. She talked, she argued, she wrote, and she organised against that which had for too long been cloaked in the mysteries of silence.
Even more difficult for not only men but for some women too to accept were the recent signs of men and women breaking free of the stifling binds of official kinship. There was the much publicised violence with which the khap panchayat reinserted women, and some men, into kinship relations which they had rejected. To take some liberties with Foucault, an older “symbolics of blood” appeared to be giving way, slowly but surely, to a new “analytics of sex.” The bloody violence of the khap panchayat has been a warfare between generations and also between genders — beleaguered older and very Hindu patriarchs versus the young men and women who risked a great deal in dreaming of caring, sharing partners and a less hierarchical life. The ferocity of khap panchayat attacks on these men and women, and the prevarications of a state which did not doubt the moral authority of these actions, has done little to deter these daily transgressions.
These kinds of developments could not have come at a worse time for those whose generational and gender authority is being challenged. The time was ripe for fostering a new and more threatening fantasy to bring the strays back to the fold. As long as the fantasies of inter-caste or cross-class relationships were confined to the silver screens, women’s khushi was not interrupted. Real women are another matter — they are often “loved” to death by men who, once spurned, wield the axe, knife or acid bottle with deadly skill. Indian cinema has nurtured this version of loving, a unidirectional flow of feeling from man to woman, whose outcomes — eventual female acquiescence — are always predictable.
Makers of meaning
On the other hand, Indian feminism’s very success has produced some contradictory outcomes. An ever-eager and sophisticated state has altered its laws, policies and plans to accommodate the language of women’s aspirations. The corporate world has found it convenient to borrow the language of feminism to reach a large and ready pool of independent consumers — for some time now, International Women’s Day has been another hallmark moment. For a while, even Hindu Right wing parties chose to adopt the slogans and battle cries of Indian feminism. Yet, our public life is replete with irresponsible utterances and outrageous actions: no protocols of political correctness are observed by loose-lipped parliamentarians or legislators, judges or journalists, since there is no accompanying political cost.
Quite simply, many Indian women are no longer the passive bearers of caste, religious, ethnic or other meaning — but the makers of meaning. That is surely a cause for dismay among those who feel their grip is loosening. Large numbers of women have gained a measure of independence, freedom from domestic tyrannies, and have won some economic and legal liberty. Straw polls, discouraging editorials and sensational headlines notwithstanding, these hard-won gains will not be diminished.
Hence the need for a clarion call to place all Hindu women under a protection they did not demand; back to a lock up where they will be safe from the dangers of independent thinking and action. We should therefore take heart in these difficult times from the courage shown by judges of the Delhi High Court in naming a clear and present danger to married women: the matrimonial home. The judges, who have noted the frequency with which husbands are convicted for murder — no less than one in ten murder cases — have declared that even the streets of a dangerous city like Delhi may be safer for women than the private sphere of the home. This is a damning indictment indeed of a space which is currently being saved from the vividly imagined dangers of “love” and companionship.

DERC to review fuel surcharge  tariff may rise in NovDERC to review fuel surcharge, tariff may go up in November
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 12:47 IST

Power tariff in the city may go up next month as Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) is all set to levy a fuel surcharge to help the private distribution companies adjust their power purchase cost.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn Power Purchase Adjustment Cost (PPAC) of around 8 per cent till October.
Chairman of Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission PD Sudhakar said a decision on "readjusting" the tariff will be taken by end of the month after examining the petitions of the three private discoms to review the PPAC.
"We will take a decision on the fuel surcharge based on petitions of the discoms . A decision will be taken by end of this month and if there is a hike in tariff, then it will come into effect from November," Sudhakar told PTI.
The regulator had introduced PPAC in 2012 to help the private power distribution companies recover additional cost on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
Delhi gets power from a number of gas and coal-based power generation plants.
Power experts said the three discoms Tata Power Delhi Distribution, BSES Rajdhani Power and BSES Yamuna Power may see a hike in the range of 6 to 8 per cent.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn PPAC of around 8 per cent for three months.
The withdrawal of the PPAC resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
In January, the DERC had hiked the fuel surcharge to the tune of 8 per cent for BSES Yamuna Power, 6 per cent for BSES Rajdhani and 7 per cent for Tata Power Delhi Distribution.
The private power distribution companies, particularly, BRPL and BYPL, have been demanding significant hike in tariff, citing rise in power purchase cost.
Both the discoms supply power in 70 per cent areas in Delhi. According to DERC figures, the private discoms operating in the city have a revenue gap of a whopping Rs 19,500 crore.
As per official figures, around 80-90 per cent of total revenue of discoms goes into purchasing power from central and state government owned entities through long term power purchase agreement, at rates determined by the central and state regulators.
The experts said discoms' cost of buying power from generating companies has increased by around 300 per cent in the last two years while the power tariff, in the corresponding period, has risen by around 70 per cent.
The city has seen a series of hike in power tariff in the last two years.
The tariff was hiked by 22 per cent in 2011 followed by five per cent hike in February 2012. The tariff was hiked by up to two per cent in May 2012 year and again by 26 per cent for domestic consumers in July 2012.
The tariff was hiked by up to three per cent in February last year and again by five per cent in August last.
The cost of buying power has increased primarily on account of an increase in the input prices of raw material like coal and gas, officials said.

Maruti Launches New Sedan Ciaz to Take on Honda  HyundaiYou are here: Home Corporates
Maruti Launches New Sedan Ciaz to Take on Honda, Hyundai
Reuters | Updated On: October 06, 2014 14:44 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the nation's top car maker, set an aggressive sales target for its first new sedan car in seven years, in a bid to break into a segment where it has previously had little success.
Sales of mid-size sedan cars in India, the world's sixth largest passenger vehicle market, fell nearly 23 per cent to 155,089 in the fiscal year to end-March from 200,176 a year ago, industry data showed, as high inflation and interest rates deterred customers.
But car makers, including Maruti, are betting on a revival in growth in Asia's third-biggest economy after a new government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi took power in May.
Maruti aims to sell between 60,000 and 80,000 of its new Ciaz cars next year, at prices starting from Rs 6,99,000 ($11,359) ex-showroom in New Delhi for the base gasoline variant, chief executive Kenichi Ayukawa said at a launch event.
With the Ciaz, Maruti will take a second stab at a segment in which its SX4 sedan, launched in 2007, has faced tough competition from rivals, including Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co, and lagged in sales.
"We have to enhance our quality. Not only with the car, but with our sales," Mr Ayukawa said when asked why Maruti, which sells nearly one in every two cars, has struggled with premium cars.
Maruti pitched Ciaz as a classier, roomier, European-styled fuel efficient car, targeting India's aspirational drivers who want to upgrade to a mid-sized sedan. It will be available in both gasoline and diesel variants and in seven colours.
The company received 10,000 bookings for the car before it announced the price, Mr Ayukawa said.
Analysts said Maruti has a better chance of success with the Ciaz than it did with the SX4, but some saw the sales target as ambitious.
"It is a competent model but I am not sure of the sales target," said Anil Sharma, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive, which has estimated full-year Ciaz sales of about 26,000.
Maruti's SX4 sales fell 40 per cent to 4,029 in the fiscal year to end-March. By comparison Honda sold 35,844 City sedans, 17 per cent higher than the previous fiscal.
"There is a lot of learning they have achieved from the SX4," Deepesh Rathore, an analyst at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors, said before the launch.
A comparatively inferior quality was one reason why Maruti's SX4 could not compete with Honda's City or Hyundai's Verna sedans, Mr Rathore said, adding that Ciaz would make up for that.
The Indian car market is also looking up, Mr Ayukawa said. "After three years of slowdown, some signs of growth are visible," he added.

Disney bails out its Paris theme parkDisney bails out its European theme park
By Mark Thompson   @MarkThompsonCNN October 6, 2014: 9:59 AM ET
 
LONDON (CNNMoney)
Paris isn't the happiest place on earth for Disney right now.
For the second time in three years, Walt Disney ( DIS ) has been forced to ride to the rescue of Disneyland Paris -- this time by leading a billion euro ($1.25 billion) refinancing of park operator Euro Disney.
Since opening in 1992, the theme park east of Paris has become Europe's top tourist attraction by visitor numbers.
But the dream has turned into a nightmare for Disney and other investors.
Attendance has been hit by Europe's economic crisis , leaving the company struggling to invest in new attractions while servicing its massive debts.
Related: The 'Disney economy' is back
Visitor numbers are expected to fall to around 14.1 million this year, 800,000 fewer than in 2013.
Hotel occupancy rates are also slumping -- down to 75% from nearly 80% last year. Euro Disney expects to lose between 110 million and 120 million euros this year.
 
Disney turns food scraps into electricity
Walt Disney owns about 40% of its European subsidiary. By guaranteeing a capital increase and converting existing debt into equity, it could end up owning the entire company, depending on whether or not other investors choose to take part in the bailout.
Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal is the second largest shareholder, with a stake of 10%, according to FactSet.
Euro Disney has a market value of about 124 million euros, and owes Disney 1.75 billion euros.

Companies Ratings on Upswing  Sharp Rise in UpgradesGold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
Mumbai: After two consecutive financial years of sub-5 per cent GDP growth, India's economy is showing early signs of recovery as reflected in a sharp rise in corporate rating upgrades in the current fiscal, rating agencies Crisil and Care said today.
The two domestic agencies said their respective ratios of rating movements are pointing towards early signs of recovery in Asia's third-largest economy which expanded at a healthy pace of 5.7 per cent in the April-June period.
"Corporate India's credit quality is showing early signs of recovery...upgrades exceeded downgrades in H1 - 741 upgrades compared to 451 downgrades," Crisil said in a report. Its competitor Care Ratings said there has been a "sharp increase" in the number of upgrades in the September quarter, where upgrades have doubled over the year ago period.
Crisil said the improvement in credit quality will be gradual and a significant recovery will be possible only on a sustained increase in investment demand.
Stating that improvement in business-related factors was the key driver for 60 per cent of the upgrades, Crisil said export-linked sectors and non-discretionary consumer segments like traders, packaged food, pharmaceuticals, textiles and farm products are getting enhanced ratings.
Players operating in the construction, engineering, capital goods and automobile ancillary sectors had higher downgrades than their counterparts in other sectors, Crisil said.
"Credit quality buoyancy in the overall economy is still some time away, and for that to happen, investment demand, which depends on the extent to which the Central government pushes big ticket policy reforms, needs to increase substantially," Crisil senior director Pawan Agrawal said.
The key aspects to monitor going forward will be impact of the monsoons, progress by indebted corporates in reducing their external debt through asset sales or equity infusion, demand outlook in the economy, and the extent of policy reforms by the government, Crisil said.
It can be noted that banks have been grappling with bad assets, which piled up during the period of low growth, and they are keenly looking forward to a revival in economic growth which will take care of their concerns.

The Navy wants drone boats to overwhelm the enemyBy Dan Lamothe October 6 Follow @danlamothe
The bombing of the USS Cole in October 2000 by al-Qaeda fighters killed 17 American sailors and underscored the difficulty of protecting U.S. Navy vessels from terrorist attacks. The service is now working on new technology that may help, however: drone boats that can swarm an incoming craft and destroy it if it doesn’t turn away.
The Office of Naval Research released information about the technology over the weekend, saying the Navy is “unleashing a new era in ship protection.” The swarms are designed to give extra protection to Marines and sailors who are on board larger ships. The drone boats are enabled by advanced sensors and software that was initially developed by NASA for use on the Mars rover, Navy officials said.

“When we look at autonomous swarm, we’re not talking about a single vessel. We’re talking about multiple, multiple vessels that can be in a defensive posture and then — when called upon — can become offensive, surround an adversary and let them know that you are coming no closer to our ship,” Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder said in a new video outlining the technology. “But of course, if an adversary then decides to come closer we can give them another warning, or potentially we can say, ‘You’ve come to close. We’re now going to destroy your vessel.’ ”
The computers on board can be added to nearly any boat, allowing the system to operate autonomously, Navy officials said. Here’s a .gif showing a computer model of a swarm:
The Navy demonstrated the swarm boats in a project on the James River, near Fort Eustis in Virginia, in August. Drone boats escorted a vessel, with some of them breaking off to stop another ship.
Navy officials hope to be able to begin operational testing for the program within a year.

The umbrella movement belongs to everyone who calls Hong Kong homeThe Future of Hong Kong
October 7, 2014
The ongoing pro-democracy protests mark a new era for Hong Kong, one where locals, expatriates and those of us in between are uniting to fight for a greater cause. The international financial hub of Hong Kong is 92.6% ethnically Chinese, according to the latest census . That leaves 7.4% of us in the “third culture,” who exist somewhere between Hong Kong and our “home countries” struggling to find where we belong amidst the complicated political system, the “one country, two systems” or “special administrative region” that leaves us with gaping holes in our national identity. The last week has changed that.
Hong Kong is my home. I grew up there, I attended school there, my family and friends reside there. My passport says I am from Hong Kong, but my ethnically Indian appearance does not. I am in the same position as 751,182 other non-Chinese residents who consider Hong Kong home, but seem confined to our own interpretations of the city. We operate within clearly defined clusters: the international school community, the Filipino community, the American expat community. Some call Hong Kong home for a short spell, while for others like me, it is the only home we have ever known. Yet none of us have ever been able to assimilate into the mainstream. We belong to Hong Kong, but we have never been able to fully feel as if Hong Kong belongs to us.
 We belong to Hong Kong, but we have never been able to fully feel as if Hong Kong belongs to us.  
It is difficult to pinpoint what separates us from the Chinese majority: minority status, language barriers and a divisive education system are a few of the many explanations. But the divide is pervasive and pernicious. In school, we learned about British colonialism, ancient China, Pearl Harbor—events that tangentially influenced Hong Kong’s history without any real understanding of how to tie those events together to understand what Hong Kong is. After explaining to foreigners that no, Hong Kong is not a part of Japan, I proceed to describe our relationship to China, spewing the “one country, two systems” party line without really understanding the entrenched implications. At my college graduation, I shifted uncomfortably as all my peers stood up, caps to their hearts, to sing the American national anthem. Hong Kong has no anthem  of its own. I often joke that the only thing Hongkongers are patriotic about is our skyline. Last week, we flipped this truism on its head.
Till now, we lived in a laissez-faire bubble where we simply assumed the government has our best interests at heart. Finally, we can move away from the political apathy that has for so long defined our citizens, and towards a political spirit that incenses and impassions us. Although we are fighting for universal suffrage, ironically, only 20% of eligible voters have thus far actually participated in elections . The protests have birthed an unprecedented political spirit that invigorates our entire population. Journalists have reported that the Hong Kong protests have given rise to a new political generation .
 The Hong Kong protests have given rise to a new political mass, one that incorporates people of all races, demographics and backgrounds, who have all sorts of varied connections to Hong Kong.  But it is not simply age that divides us. The Hong Kong protests have given rise to a new political mass, one that incorporates people of all races, demographics and backgrounds, who have all sorts of varied connections to Hong Kong. Social media has created a web of people and information, united by the pride, hope and optimism that these revolutionary events could bring upon our city. Facebook is flooded with messages of support and profile photos changed to an image of a yellow ribbon against a black background. Through Whatsapp, WeChat and Snapchat we’re sharing in our extended network photos of deserted roads, videos of chanting on the street, and wishes that we will be able to forever change the fate of our city. A renewed wave of patriotism has swept the streets of Hong Kong and taken us all in its tide. If we were to vote right now, voter turnout would be at an all-time high.
As Hana Alberts so aptly puts it, Hong Kong’s diaspora isn’t simply “limited to Cantonese people in Chinatowns across the continents, but instead broadly inclusive of everyone who’s called Hong Kong home .” The protests have broken down the cultural silos that have persisted for so long in Hong Kong’s multicultural population. Our community has become greater than our differences.
Recent headlines have commented on the many freedoms that separate Hong Kong from China: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, but we are experiencing for the first time a new freedom that is unique to our “third culture:” freedom of identity. The very liberties that separate us from China have finally given us the freedom to be who we really are: Hongkongers, first and foremost, striving together to fight for our rights.

Chinas leaders dont have many good options to quell a protracted Hong Kong pro-democracy movementThe Future of Hong Kong
October 7, 2014
Hong Kong’s  pro-democracy civil disobedience movement  appears to be losing some steam, as the numbers of protesters dwindle and the groups behind the demonstrations seek to negotiate a exit. But even if the protesters return to school and work,  they can always return —and that means China’s leaders can’t rest easy.
Though the Chinese Communist Party has control of the world’s second-largest economy and its largest standing army, those vast forces aren’t nearly as useful as they might seem for defeating a protracted protest movement.
Physical intimidation is counterproductive
Attempts to strong-arm the mostly peaceful protesters has only helped their cause so far. When police blasted protesters with tear gas and pepper spray on the evening of Sep. 28, popular outrage sent thousands of residents to the streets in support of the movement, notes Steve Tsang , a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at University of Nottingham. And when reputed organized crime figures and other pro-Beijingers roughed up the protesters in Mongkok last weekend, it only drew more demonstrators to their defense.
Hong Kong’s economy is hard to disrupt
Economic reprisals—like Beijing’s freezing of tourist visas for mainlanders, who tend to spend heavily in Hong Kong shops—might have some effect. Along with generalized business disruptions caused by the demonstrations, lower tourist spending could help fuel local businesses’ resentment against the demonstrators.
But the threat is not really that menacing. Since retail and tourism make up a teeny fraction of the economy, even a year-long occupation of downtown Hong Kong would drag down the territory’s GDP by just 1%, argues Richard Harris in the South China Morning Post (paywall). As for the blow the protests might deal to the financial sector, only about 15% of the Hang Seng stock index comprises companies sensitive to events in Hong Kong, says Harris.
The less the protesters disrupt the economy, the longer they can hold out—and the more media attention they win for their argument that true “universal suffrage” for chief executive elections isn’t possible when Beijing insists on screening the candidates. All the while, the global reputation of China’s leaders will suffer, as will its credibility with Taiwan—a democratic country claimed by China with which PRC leaders are trying to forge a closer relationship—and in restive regions, like Xinjiang, Tibet, and, increasingly, Macau.
The Tiananmen option would cause chaos
Even if unrest intensifies, deploying mainland troops would require the suspension of the very rule of law that makes Hong Kong a financial center of China.
Hong Kong law explicitly says that China’s military shall not interfere in Hong Kong, says Fu Hualing , law professor at the University of Hong Kong, in a recent blog post. There are two exceptions: Hong Kong’s chief executive can request military assistance from PLA troops garrisoned in Hong Kong for defense purposes; and China’s central government can also send in troops from the mainland—but only if there is turmoil that endangers either national unity or security and is beyond the control of the Hong Kong government.
Either way, deploying troops in Hong Kong would be “a disaster that neither Beijing nor Hong Kong wish to see,” Fu writes.
The economic consequences wouldn’t just devastate Hong Kong’s economy; they could also send investors in mainland China running for the exits, says Andrew Scobell, senior political scientist at Rand Corporation.
“Hong Kong can continue to function [with the current level of protests]. The economy can continue to chug along,” he says. “But if things escalate, if things get out of control, if Hong Kong or the Beijing authorities feel the need to crack down… then that’s when you see the specter of an outflow of capital.”
Right now, the Chinese financial system is increasingly hooked on  money flowing into Hong Kong from abroad . If that flow stops, it could easily cause the sort of panic that happened in June 2013, when banks stopped lending to each other and credit froze up. For a country where non-financial corporate debt now stands at 150% of GDP , that would be disastrous.
Beijing is a lot less intractable than it lets on
The Chinese government has backed down before in its efforts to rein in Hong Kong freedoms, notes Scott Harold, also a Rand political scientist.
“It’s worth remembering that in 2003, the Hong Kong government tried to push through a very restrictive public security law… and when the masses came to the street that law was pulled back and shelved indefinitely,” says Harold.
Something similar happened in 2012: when the government tried to institute mandatory “patriotic” education, it inspired a  popular backlash that created Scholarism , the student movement leading the protests today. The government also ended up allowing the village of Wukan, in Guangdong Province, to run free and fair elections for party representatives after the villagers staged an uprising in late 2011.
But that’s not the image China’s leaders like to project, says Harold.
“The notion that China cannot compromise is in fact a part of China’s bargaining leverage,” he says. “They seek to portray themselves as incapable of compromising to convince others that they will have to compromise.”

Which warns of  spiralling16th May
Eon has agreed to pay £12m to vulnerable customers after Ofgem’s investigation unearthed large scale mis-selling.
Ofgem’s investigation found that the energy supplier had been giving incorrect information to customers between June 2010 to December 2013, which could have misled them.
Ofgem didn’t find any evidence that Eon had set out to deliberately mis-sell to customers, however, it did find the company had failed to properly train and monitor staff.
Customers to get compensation
Eon’s large scale mis-selling has resulted in the biggest ever supplier pay-out, with £12m put aside for customers.
Eon will pay around £35 to 333,000 Warm Home Discount customers. Automatic payments will be paid to some vulnerable customers, and 465,000 will receive letters to see if they are entitled to compensation. Eon has also set up a dedicated hotline, 0800 0568 497, for customers to get in touch.
Eon chief executive Tony Cocker has apologised to customers, adding:
‘It is completely unacceptable that we may have been unclear with customers about their tariff choices and as a result those customers may not have made the best choices for them.’
The damage has been done
In response to the fine, our executive director Richard Lloyd said:
‘While this fine sends a clear warning message that mis-selling won't be tolerated, it's too late for customers who were mis-sold and the damage to consumer confidence in the energy industry has already been done.’
Our investigations in 2011 found clear evidence that suppliers weren't giving people the best deal - it's extraordinary that mis-selling has continued for so long.
Richard Lloyd added:
‘Energy suppliers should not wait for the outcome of the proposed competition review and must seize their last chance to sort out woeful service standards and put customers first.’
We think you should be able to trust that the price you pay for your energy is fair. If you want to help us Fix the Big Six, sign our petition and get your friends and family to do the same.

Modi s commitment to fight poverty impressiv...Bill Gates
("We came away impressed…)
NEW YORK: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to improve health services and his focus on ending open defecation has "impressed" Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates who said it is "inspiring" to see India move to the forefront of providing such services to the underprivileged.
"Modi has India talking about toilets...This is not the kind of issue that most politicians like to talk about. But I would guess that in the short time he has been in office, Prime Minister Modi has done more to raise the awareness of the need for toilets than any other leader since the country gained independence," Gates said in a blog post titled 'Meeting the New Prime Minister.'
In the blog, Gates writes about his meeting with Modi in New Delhi last month when he and his wife Melinda focussed on toilets, vaccines, bank accounts and health clinics in their "more than an hour" long discussions.
"We came away impressed by his commitment to fighting poverty and improving health for India's poorest people," Gates said.
"This is an exciting time, not just for India, but for everyone who cares about giving the poorest people a chance to lead healthy, productive lives. With all the attention and innovation going on in these areas--from health to financial services--we have a fantastic opportunity to make an impact. It's inspiring to see India moving to the forefront of these efforts," he said.
Gates said Modi "made it clear" that he is "frustrated" with the slow pace of improvement in expanding and improving sanitation services across the country.
Modi, who wants to end open defecation by 2019, shared with the billionaire couple few of his ideas, including installing toilets in bus and rail stations in 500 towns.
Gates said Modi has been "quite outspoken" on open defecation, a subject one hears much less about.
"It may seem surprising when you think about all the innovation coming out of India, but 630 million people there defecate in the open because they don't have access to a commode. Worldwide, the number is 2.5 billion people," he said, adding that creating good sanitation options for people is a big focus of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.
Gates discussed with the Indian leader the opportunity to design 21st century toilets that do not need big sewage systems and water treatment plants.
He praised Modi for being "generous" with his time with them even though his office was busy with the visit of Chinese President Xi Jingping and the floods in Jammu and Kashmir.
"Judging from our time there, it sounds like he's setting aggressive goals and pushing people to get them done quickly. He's having a lot of intense meetings with various ministers, asking them, 'What can you do in 100 days? Can you make your goals more concrete? More ambitious?'," Gates wrote.

Posters warn Kannadigas in Chennai as Karnataka HC hears Jayalalithaa s bail pleaHundreds of supporters protested on the streets and shouted slogans on Tuesday after the Karnataka High Court denied bail to AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa who was jailed by a Bengaluru court in a corruption case last month.
 
Jayalalithaa was forced to step down as chief minister of Tamil Nadu after being found guilty of amassing wealth beyond her known sources of income and was replaced by her close aide O Panneerselvam. The Bengaluru special court handed her a four-year prison sentence and a Rs100-crore penalty.
 
Unless the conviction is overturned by a higher court, the AIADMK chief will be disqualified from contesting elections for a period of 10 years from the date of the verdict.
 
Celebrations by the party cadre fizzled out after initial media reports that Jayalalithaa had been granted bail turned out to be incorrect. Tight security was in place around the high court complex with police anticipating a rush of AIADMK supporters and leaders.

Rejecting Jayalalithaa’s plea, justice AV Chandrashekhara said there were no grounds for granting bail and reacted sharply when Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said he would not oppose if bail was granted conditionally. “The public prosecutor filed strong written objections but when he was asked to present arguments before this court, he said no objection.”
The bail petitions of Jayalalithaa's associates Sasikala Natarajan, VK Sudhakaran and J Ilavarasi were also rejected on the same grounds. The AIADMK chief is likely to approach the Supreme Court in appeal on Wednesday.
Citing several orders of the apex court, the judge said, “Suspension of sentence is not automatic (when an appeal is filed). Bail at conviction stage is different from bail when trial is on.”
“Corruption amounts to violation of human rights and leads to economic imbalance,” the judge added.
Watch: Jayalalithaa’s bail plea rejected by Karnataka HC
 
The 66-year-old AIADMK chief, a former movie star, has a cult following in her state and is renowned for distributing free laptops, jewellery and fans to voters.
On Tuesday morning, posters saying Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu would be held hostage if Jayalalithaa was not released from jail sprung up in parts of Chennai.
The AIADMK tried to distance itself from the row and its workers tore down the sheets allegedly put up by an expelled party member.

“Warning...immediately release people's Chief Minister Amma...otherwise we will hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu as hostages,” read the message which also bore the name of several AIADMK members.
The party said the posters were put up without its knowledge and stressed that it stood committed to the welfare of all sections of society.

Haryana polls: Glitzy Gurgaon flanked by under-developed Mewat4
0
Gurgaon: Even as Gurgaon boasts of 26 malls and its own rapid metro system, Mewat district, just kilometers away, has a different story to tell. The district has only one girls' school for 190 villages and even lacks basic facilities.
Gurgaon which saw 71 per cent voter turnout in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls knows what they want from their political leaders.
One of the voters said, "I will vote for someone who can provide better safety for women. I will vote for better business opportunity."
#haryana assembly elections 2014 #haryana #gurgaon #mewat
But there are in fact two Gurgaons. And unfortunately, the urban, corporate, liberal and educated Gurgaon seemed to be unaware of the other.
People in Gurgaon have no knowledge about Mewat district. A resident said, "I have heard the name but don't have much of an idea. I don't know."
It has become hard to believe that Mewat is one of the three districts that make up the Gurgaon Lok Sabha constituency.
The glitz and glamour of Gurgaon seemed almost vulgar in comparison to the ground realities of Mewat. Just 50 kms from Delhi, there has barely any roads, water, sanitation or even basic healthcare facilities.
The Meos, a distinct Muslim ethnic group that accounts for 74 per cent of Mewat's population, seemed fully aware that development has bypassed their district completely.
A resident said, "There has been no development here. So much work has been done in Haryana but even water is not available heere."
Irfan Ahmed, a resident, said, "I feel like crying at our condition. We deserve to have at least one unversity here. Don't we?"
The worse part was in Ferozpur Jhirka block, where for 190 villages there is only one girls' school. And given the closed mindset of many men, the women clearly have it tough. A few women refused to tell their tales behind closed doors, describing a grim situation.
A woman resident said, "Girls want to study but there is no facility for them.  No one asks us anything."
A girl student said, "I want to become nurse, but family does not allow us to study."
The women and youth of Mewat do want to move forward and catch up with nearby Gurgaon. But change needs leaders to rise above social and political compulsions, one hopes the coming elections will give Haryana that leadership.

Senior Cong leaders to discuss TharoorcontroversyPrint
Written by Shaju Philip | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:56 pm
Senior Congress leaders in Kerala would meet on Wednesday to what action has to be initiated against party MP and spokesman Shashi Tharoor. The Congress MP from Kerala capital had come under fire from party leadership in the state after he accepted the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to join the Swacch Bharat campaign.
Senior leader and Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala told the media that party top brass in Kerala would meet on Wednesday to discuss the issue.
The party in Kerala can not accept Tharoor extending support for Modi. A Congress leader should not adopt a stand supporting BJP or RSS agenda, said Chennithala.
He said party state president V M Sudheeran and Chief Minister Oommen Chandy would meet tomorrow to look into the issue.

SP to mobilise over 1 lakh workers during national conventiondayPrint
Written by Mohd Faisal Fareed | Lucknow | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:35 pm
In a show of strength, Samajwadi Party is geared up to bring over one lakh workers on the last day of its national convention at Lucknow with an eye on 2017 assembly elections. Earlier it was planned to restrict attendance.
The three day national convention of the party begins from Wednesday at 367 acre Janeshwar Mishra Park in Lucknow.
“We expect a crowd of over one lakh workers during the open session of national convention. Workers from every part of the state including more than a dozen other states units are coming to attend the convention,” Rajendra Choudhary, state spokesperson, SP stated. Workers are being mobilised from all the districts for the final day which has been named open session.
Earlier, SP had planned to restrict the national convention’s attendance to maximum 10000 delegates. Nearly 8000 invitation letters were sent to leaders to participate as delegates by depositing Rs 200. However, to make the event as a show of strength, the last day has been converted into a rally with attendance of over one lakh persons.
SP leaders claim that the convention will give new direction to the party. SP which was routed in Lok Sabha polls in now in an upbeat mood after winning bypolls.
All eyes are on Mulayam’s inaugural address as numbers of disgruntled workers in SP are on rise. Workers are not discussing the routine political and economic resolution to be passed during the convention as party hardly has any numeric value left at Delhi. Lofty claims of making villages sustainable, fighting communalism, maintaining law and order, innovative ideas to control price rise, lashing out at China and Pakistan remain the mainstay of the resolution since past one decade.
It is expected that Mulayam will not hesitate in attacking Akhilesh Yadav’s ministers which he had done in the past realising that already government has completed half of its tenure and workers are disgruntled with the working of ministers. Such talks boasts the morale of workers though ministers hardly mend their ways.
It is also first time that national convention is being held with the state unit of the party lying defunct. Even the district units have not been constituted after being dissolved post Lok Sabha elections debacle.
Arrangements done are on a lavish scale. Massive stage of 2400 square feet has been set up with a water proof pandal of 50000 square feet for fooding arrangements with delicacies from different states. Another 40000 square feet has been covered with a pandal for seating arrangements of delegates. Sound system include line array system with 24 big speakers and 93 cone shape speakers.
LED screens are there at convention and also in other areas of Lucknow for direct transmission. A big 25 feet tall bronze statue of Janeshwar Mishra will also be unveiled.
Transport arrangements from all major points in Lucknow and several hotels including starred ones have been reserved for leaders. Whole Lucknow has been decked up with hoardings and buntings. Separate media enclosure with internet facility too has been set up at the venue.
Officially the programme continued…

Umbrella Generation: Hong Kong s despairing youth split with old guardprint

Hong Kong's unprecedented student-led democracy rallies have highlighted a stark divide between a disenfranchised younger generation who say they have little to lose, and an older guard who favour pragmatism over protest.
Read: Hong Kong protest leaders agree to talks as numbers dwindle
Throughout the past week the legions of predominantly youthful demonstrators camped out on the city's streets have focused their energies on the single galvanising issue that sparked the mass sit-ins -- universal suffrage.
Dubbed the Umbrella Revolution after umbrellas were used to protect from pepper spray and tear gas, protesters say Hong Kongers should be allowed to both nominate and choose their next leader in 2017.
Beijing insists only candidates vetted by a loyalist committee will be able to stand for election.
But the battle for full democracy in the former British colony is only part of why so many of the financial hub's youngsters have taken a leading role in what has become the greatest challenge to China's hold over the territory since its 1997 handover.
The protests are taking place against a backdrop of rising inequality and soaring living costs which leave many young people with little prospect of renting, let alone buying, their own homes.
Increased competition with wealthy mainlanders, anger over the cosy relationship between the government and Hong Kong's financial elite and a sense of alienation from the ruling authorities have left the younger generation deeply uneasy about what awaits them in adulthood.
Shadow Wu, a 16-year-old secondary school student, believes the government simply does not care about what awaits its younger generation.
"The government now doesn't listen to our concerns, it's a fake government that doesn't respond to the needs of the people," she fumes.
But Wu, who has spent the last nine days camped out with two teenage friends, admits her grandparents believe her protest is a "waste of time". 
"My grandmother and grandfather had really hard lives, so they think we're silly and that we should be happy to have comfortable lives," she says.
Bleak prospects
Unlike their Chinese compatriots on the mainland, whose desires for greater personal and political freedoms have largely been counteracted by Beijing with the
promise of stellar economic growth, Hong Kong's youngsters are ever more restricted by the rocketing cost of living.
The average rent at 50 major housing estates hit a record high of HK$26.99 per square foot in August, the South China Morning Post reported last month, meaning a tiny 300 square foot flat goes for at least HK$8,000 a month ($1,030).
In comparison, the average monthly graduate salary last year was just US$1,650, job search website jobsDB found.
Carol Hung is typical of many young professionals protesting -- a 30-year-old graphic designer, she lives with her parents and feels her future is bleak.
"We feel that the past generation achieved a stable life if they worked, but now, no matter how hard we work, we may not be able to achieve this."
Hung, who has drawn a series of satirical cartoons that have gone viral in recent days, also says the city's younger generations -- many of whom are the first in their families to go to university -- are more determined to fight for personal freedoms than their parents.
"The last generation saw their livelihoods as their priority but for our generation, a lot of us have had access to more education so we will have a different mindset."
Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo says that the mass protests are young people's "one big chance" to voice their anger, frustration and resentment.
"We used to believe in the 'Lion Rock spirit'," says Mo, using a local phrase which refers to a mountain overlooking some of the city's poorer districts and encapsulates Hong Kong's renown as a place where hard work and perseverance meant a brighter future.
"The younger generation feel that Lion Rock spirit has been killed off."
'Too radical'
Many of Hong Kong's older citizens escaped grinding poverty or political persecution on the Chinese mainland and toiled long hours to give their children a better life.
Some now believe their children and grandchildren risk throwing that away in what they see as a "radical" protest.
"I support democracy, but I don't agree with this approach," said Chan Kuen, a 69-year-old retired civil servant.
"Rents are so expensive now, but shops have had to shut. What they are doing is too radical and people's livelihoods have been affected."
"What can they achieve?" questioned one man in his eighties, who was watching the protests at a distance and gave his name as Hui.
"They should be going to school instead. If the government decides to clear this area, they are doomed."
But student movements have played pivotal roles during political upheaval in recent Chinese history -- from the anti-imperialist protests of 1919, to the bloodletting of the Cultural Revolution and the quashed Tiananmen protests.
And some older members of the community have shown their solidarity.
"I think I should give some support because they are doing what is right," said Kwok Kwai-to, a 61-year-old retired bus driver who had spent almost a week protesting.
"I will be doing it until there is an answer, whether it's a crackdown or dialogue. I am willing to go to jail because I am old."

Eye Rs 1000cr revenue; promoter share at 65%: Gammon Infra01:30 pm
KK Mohanty, managing director,  Gammon Infrastructure says the company has pared the promoter share by 15 percent to 65 percent.
Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Mohanty says the company is not into corporate debt restructuring (CDR)  and has more than 6 operational projects that are currently CASA positive.
Furthermore, he adds that while the company’s Nasik and Mumbai tollway has seen a dip in traffic, the company expects to log in a revenue of Rs 1000 cr.
Below is the edited transcript of the interview to CNBC-TV18.
Nigel: Last week ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund picked up good amount of shares. What has changed and how is the business prospect looking?
A: It’s an extremely positive sign for the company because who’s who of the investment industry are looking forward with confidence to our company. We are one of the build, operate and transfer (BOT) Company in the country where we have held ourselves extremely well in difficult times. We are more than six operational projects which are cash surplus. We do not have a single project which has negative cash flow.
We are on the verge on completing three more projects - Pravara renewable energy, Godavari Bridge and Patna-Hajipur annuity project. In the next three-six months time that will be operational – that will add Rs 350-400 crore to the topline and those projects are likely to be cash surplus also. In the recent past we have got Bijwada project operationalised. In this depressing situation of the last two years, this is one project where the toll collection has been slightly better than expected. So that is giving positive strength to the project. We started that project with more than two years delay but fortunately that’s working out reasonably okay for us.
We bid this project two-and-a-half year back and it was a premium project of Rs 57 crore but still today we are implementing that project and we feel that this is a good project.
Latha: Its still cash positive?
A: Yes.
Latha: To finish the qualified institutional placement (QIP) part – what is the dilution that has happened so far?
A: From promoter angle the dilution was around 14-15percent, from 75 percent it came down to 60 percent.
Latha: This was the part of the corporate debt restructuring schemes (CDR)?
A: No.
Latha: But as part of the CDR the promoters had to bring in cash. Is that done?
A: There are two parts - Gammon India is in CDR. Gammon Infrastructure is not in CDR, we are completely out of CDR, none of our projects are restructured yet, we are not into CDR.
Latha: Can you take us through revenue earnings next year since you say three more projects will come on stream?
A: Our annualised turnover will be more than Rs 1,000 crore because implementation of two projects started; we are doing part of EPC of those projects; there will be some engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) building from those projects also there will be some EPC building from those projects especially Bijwada and Sidhi-Singrauli.
Latha: What will it do to your debt?
A: At project level all debts are self servicing. In HoldCo we had a third party loan of Rs 300 crore. However, with this QIP we have cleared up around Rs 150 crore, so that has come down from Rs 300 to Rs 150 crore.
Latha: You took enabling provision for Rs 500 crore equity raising?
A: Correct.
Latha: You will do a little more?
A: We might go for in future once the market sentiments are better and we get a realistic reflection of our valuation in the marketcap then we will go for it.
Nigel: Do you have any equity commitments to any of your projects in the coming year?
A: We have started two projects - Sidhi-Singrauli the equity commitment has been fulfilled and nearly 100 crore already pumped in Bijwada also. We have to generate Rs 150 crore from those projects. So, in three years period we will have a requirement of balance of around Rs 100 crore-150 crore.
Latha: In your existing six projects which are already cash positive, have you seen any improvement in amount of traffic. This is a macro economic question. Is growth happening?
A: Fortunately four-five projects are annuity projects. Two projects which are relevant are Mumbai-Nasik – there is a little depressing traffic for the last two-two-and-a-half year, but one positive aspect of this coal block cancellation our Vizag port is looking very attractive today because dredging is getting completed to 16 feet and there will be lot of coal import coming in, so the side effect of those decisions will make our Vizag port very attractive.

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra  Tuesday said its two-wheeler arm has made an offer to acquire 51 percent stake in Peugeot Motorcycles, part of the 54 billion euro PSA Group based in France.
In a statement, M&M said under the "binding offer" made by Mahindra Two Wheelers Ltd (MTWL), there would be an "infusion of 15 million euro into Peugeot Motocycles (PMTC) to finance projects implemented through strategic partnership, and further sale of shares by PSA, which would allow MTWL to take 51 percent stake in PMTC."
"The transaction between MTWL and PSA is subject to Works Council consultation as part of the employee dialogue process and anti-trust law," it added.
Commenting on the development, M&M Executive Director Pawan Goenka said: "The coming together of Mahindra and Peugeot is a win-win for the two-wheeler businesses of both companies. Mahindra would offer access to the Indian market, mass market product technology and competence in marketing while Peugeot brings premium range, a strong European footprint, and a globally recognised brand."
This partnership would enable both MTWL and PMTC to speed up their international expansion by driving synergies and leveraging respective strengths of both parties, he added.
PMTC, also known as Peugeot Scooters is a key player in urban mobility in Europe for 116 years, and is the oldest motorised two-wheeler manufacturer in the world.
It offers one of the most comprehensive range of scooters and mopeds, from 50cc to 400cc, including the successful three-wheeled scooter -- Metropolis -- in the European market, M&M said in its statement.
Over the past few years, Mahindra has strengthened its position in the two-wheeler segment globally. Mahindra Racing competes at the highest level of global motorcycle racing in the Moto3 category of MotoGP, while Mahindra GenZe recently revealed its electric two-wheelers in the US market that offer sustainable urban transport solutions to a new generation of US consumers.
The company had recently launched Gusto scooter. MTWL also has sales and distribution operations in Latin America, Africa and South Asia. It has assembly operations in many of these markets.

India to top global remittances in 2014: World BankIndia to top global remittances with $71 billion this year, says World Bank
Lalit K Jha     Washington   Last Updated: October 7, 2014  | 15:35 IST
The Bank said remittances to the South Asia region are increasing more robustly this year, accelerating from slower growth in 2013. Although flows to India, the region's largest remittance recipient, will grow modestly by 1.5 per cent in 2014. (Photo: Reuters)
India will retain its top spot with $71 billion in remittances this year as remittances to developing countries are expected to reach $435 billion, an increase of five per cent over 2013, the World Bank has said.
In its latest issue of the Migration and Development Brief, the World Bank said on Monday- India, with the world's largest emigrant stock of 14 million people, will remain in the top spot this year, attracting about $71 billion in remittances.
"Remittances to developing countries grew this year by five per cent. Remittance inflows provided stable cover for substantial parts of the import bill for such countries as Egypt, Pakistan, Haiti, Honduras, and Nepal," said Kaushik Basu, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank Group.
He said India and China led the chart with "projected remittance inflows of $71 and $64 billion respectively in 2014."
Other large recipients are China ($64 billion), the Philippines ($28 billion), Mexico ($24 billion), Nigeria ($21 billion), Egypt ($18 billion), Pakistan ($17 billion), Bangladesh ($15 billion), Vietnam ($11 billion) and Ukraine ($9 billion).
The growth rate this year is substantially faster than the 3.4 per cent growth recorded in 2013, driven largely by remittances to Asia and Latin America, it said.
Remittances to developing countries will continue climbing in the medium term, reaching an estimated $ 454 billion in 2015. Global remittances, including those to high-income countries, are estimated at $582 billion this year, rising to $608 billion next year, it said.
The Bank said remittances to the South Asia region are increasing more robustly this year, accelerating from slower growth in 2013. Although flows to India, the region's largest remittance recipient, will grow modestly by 1.5 per cent in 2014.
The expansion is being led by flows from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, where skilled and unskilled workers are finding renewed job opportunities.
As a result, the growth rate of remittances to the region is expected to more than double this year to 5.5 per cent (from 2.7 per cent in 2013), boosting volumes to $ 117 billion in 2014 and rising further to $ 123 billion in 2015, it said.
"In addition, India and the Philippines benefit from having migrants with the most diverse destination spread, thereby creating buffers against regional shocks. Given the growing importance of this sector, the World Bank's Migration and Development Brief has become an essential tool for global development policy experts," Basu said.
The brief notes that the global average cost of sending remittances continued its downward trend in the third quarter of 2014, falling to 7.9 per cent of the value sent, compared to 8.9 per cent a year earlier. However, the cost of sending money to Africa remains stubbornly high, exceeding 11 per cent.
As a share of GDP (2013), the top recipients of remittances were Tajikistan (42 per cent), Kyrgyz Republic (32 per cent), Nepal (29 per cent), Moldova (25 per cent), Lesotho and Samoa (24 per cent each), Armenia and Haiti (both 21 per cent), the Gambia (20 per cent) and Liberia (18 per cent).
It said the forced migration due to conflict was at its highest level since World War II, affecting more than 51 million people.
An additional 22 million people have been forced to move due to natural disasters, bringing the total affected by forced migration to at least 73 million, according to the latest available data.
"Despite the encouraging outlook for remittance flows, the circumstances of many migrants are troubling," said Dilip Ratha, Lead Economist, Migration and Remittances, at the World Bank's Development Prospects Group and Head of the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD).
"With so many people on the move against their will and many others undertaking desperate and dangerous journeys, it is clear that more effort is needed to make migration safer and cheaper by exploring economically viable policy options," he said.

Time to wash away Cong-NCPs sins : NarendraModiComments
PM Narendra Modi said years of neglect by the state government had led to large-scale migration of the youth from villages to large cities and towns in search of jobs.
Slamming successive Congress-NCP governments in Maharashtra for being steeped in “corruption”,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said time has come to wash away its “sins of 15 years”.
“15th October is the festival of washing away the sins of the 15 years of Congress-NCP governments, to bring an end to 15 years of corruption and destruction,” he said addressing a rally at Erandol in Jalgaon district.
“The governments in Maharashtra did not spare anything and anybody from corruption. They snatched away the food from the platters of children who were supposed to get it under the mid-day meal scheme, they left the farms thirsty and took away electricity meant for farmers,” he said.
Modi said years of neglect by the state government had led to large-scale migration of the youth from villages to large cities and towns in search of jobs.
“I know what poverty is, the pain one feels when one does not have money to buy medicine for an ailing mother…I want that the youth does not have to leave their old parents, their villages, their farms behind and go looking for jobs in cities,” he said.
“My government is committed to people, to doing big things for small people,” he said amid loud cries of “Modi! Modi!” from a responsive crowd.
He slammed the erstwhile Congress-led UPA government for dragging its feet in completing the Sardar Sarovar dam project, resulting in denial of electricity worth Rs 400 crore every year to Maharashtra that it would have got free of cost.
“Since 2004, they (Centre) did not allow us to put even a bag of cement on the dam. Today, the work has started on construction of a hydel power project at Sardar Sarovar dam which would let Maharashtra avail of Rs 400 crore worth of electricity free of cost every year,” he said.
“Had the work on the project been completed 10 years ago, Maharashtra would have got electricity worth Rs 4000 crore by now. What they could not do in 15 years, I did within 15 days of becoming Prime Minister,” Modi said.
He said a lie was being spread that BJP, if voted to power, will split Maharashtra.
“You don’t know the strength of the people of Maharashtra. No power can divide Maharashtra and take away Mumbai from it,” he said.
Though he targeted Congress for spreading the lie, BJP’s former ally Shiv Sena has been most vocal about the party wanting to divide the state by creating Vidarbha. BJP has been supportive of the demand for a separate Vidarbha state, which the Sena has stoutly opposed over the years.
Modi has said he would not attack Shiv Sena during the election campaign.
“Political pundits are saying why is Modi not criticising Shiv Sena in his speeches (during poll campaign).
This is the first election in absence continued…

Five reasons markets are sinking | Sensex plunges over 250 pointsSensex ends 296 points down; top 5 reasons why Indian markets are under pressure
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 7, 2014, 03.55PM IST

(As per provisional data,…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex ended nearly 300 points lower following a sharp correction in European markets. Nifty has breached 50-day DMA and further downside in the near term can't be ruled out, say analysts.
The 50-share index closed at 7,852.40, down 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent. The S&P BSE Sensex ended at 26,271.97, down 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
DLF (5.68%), NMDC (5.57%), Jindal Steel (4.92%), Hindalco (4.90%) and Sesa Sterlite (4.49%) were among the top losers.
NTPC (up 1.62%), GAIL (up 1.16%), Power Grid Corporation (up 1.07%), Tata Power (up 0.93%) and Wipro (up 0.64%) were among the Nifty gainers.
Here is a list of five possible reasons which may be responsible for the current weakness in the markets:
Profit booking by FIIs:
Foreign institutional investors, which were largely responsible for an over 25 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex, have become net sellers of Indian equities in the last five trading sessions.
As per provisional data, FIIs have sold net of Rs 2583.95 in the last five trading sessions, while DIIs or domestic institutional investors remain net buyers.
On a monthly basis, MFs continued to be net buyers (US$526.9mn) of Indian equities in September 2014 for the fifth month in a row.
While FII net buying continued, the run-rate has come down to US$1bn in the past two months compared to US$2.2bn in the previous five months beginning March 2014, ICICI Securities said in a report.
"There has been lull in the FII flows in the last 7 to 10 days. It is because of the volatility in the global liquidity which we have witnessed in the last 7 to 10 days," said Sanjay Dongre, Fund Manager , UTI Asset Company Pvt. Ltd.
"We have seen a bit of volatility even in the forex market where the dollar has appreciated against most of the currencies. So, once there is a bit of stability in the currency market , looking at the attractiveness of the Indian market, the flows from the FII sides are likely to continue going forward also," he added.
Caution ahead of Q2 earnings:
Infosys will be the first Sensex company to declare its results for the quarter ended September 30. The IT major will declare its second quarter numbers this Friday on the 10 October.
The month of October could be volatile as earnings will take center stage, say analysts. At present levels, there is a little margin of safety and either equities correct or earnings have to surprise on the upside, they say.
"Keeping in mind the last month closing, I broadly expect a volatile month with bias on the negative side as we have less number of trading sessions due to the festive session break, but a lot more depends upon how the earnings season shapes up," said Ajit Mishra , AVP- Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
Arvind Sanger , Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management , said this quarter earnings are not going to have any meaningful benefit from Modi's election or anything else that has happened since then.
Slowdown in Europe/China:
Dwindling demand cut factory activity across much of Asia and Europe in September, sending it to multi-month lows and raising the chances that global growth will slow in the months ahead.
Despite gentler price rises, China's figures were mired barely above contraction, Britain slumped, and the drop in new orders did not even spare Germany , the strongest member of the euro zone currency bloc, or France, its No. 2 economy , Reuters reported.
Euro zone factories' final September PMI was 50.3, a further slackening in pace and its lowest reading since July last year, as new orders contracted for the first time in more than a year, added the report.
"The global trend, that has been a little bit of a risk off, is that Europe is in a recession and things are not getting any better. The Ukraine and Russia tensions are continuing, casting some stress on the European economy, and with China weakness there is a little bit of nervousness about the risk off on a global basis," said Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management.
"So, there has been some sell off in India and elsewhere. We could always have something go off the rails, but barring any major upheavals on a global basis, the market will continue to consolidate and for it to go much lower, it would take some more global negative cues," he added.
Lack of Big-Bang Reforms by Modi Government:
The S&P BSE Sensex closed on a muted note, down 56 points, for the month of September. Domestic issues such as coal block de-allocation and fading hopes of a rate hike in 2015 have kept the markets under pressure.
September 2014 was marked by three high-level bilateral engagements by India's PM -- with Japan, China and the US -- aimed at improving trade and diplomatic relations.
These engagements are expected to improve India's visibility in the global arena, especially amongst EMs.

Gold, Silver Prices Rise on Seasonal Demand
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 07, 2014 14:42 (IST)
Government to Streamline Subsidies, Cheap LPG for Rich May Go: Finance Minister
New Delhi: Gold prices spurted by Rs 210 to Rs 27,280 per ten grams at the bullion market here today following sustained buying by stockists on pick-up in seasonal demand.
However, a weak trend in global market as the dollar advanced towards a four-year high reducing demand for an alternative investment, capped the rise.
Silver also recorded a significant rise of Rs 960 to Rs 39,250 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Bullion merchants said sustained buying by jewellers as well as stockists on the back of pick-up in seasonal demand mainly led to the rise in gold and silver prices.
Besides, diversion of funds from equity markets towards bullion also supported the upside in precious metal prices, they said.
Globally, gold in Singapore rose as much as 0.4 per cent to $1,203.02 an ounce and silver gained 0.3 per cent to $17.39 an ounce.
In the national capital, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity shot up by Rs 210 each to Rs 27,280 and Rs 27,080 per ten grams, respectively. It had gained Rs 40 yesterday.
Sovereign also found some buying support and prices were up by Rs 50 to Rs 24,150 per piece of eight grams.
Silver coins remained in demand and rose by another Rs 1,000 to Rs 68,000 for buying and Rs 69,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Shelling exposes Pak frustration after failure to get response on Kashmir: Omar AbdullahPress Trust of India | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:19 pm
Condemning the shelling on civilians in Arnia region of Jammu that left five dead, J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Monday said that targeting of civilian areas exposed the frustration of the Pakistani government after its failure to gain international attention on the Kashmir issue.
“They (the Pakistani leadership) have nothing else to speak, but only Kashmir. Whenever they go abroad, they try to raise only Kashmir issue, but every time they miserably fail to get international attention. The cross-border shelling is an indication of their frustration,” he told reporters after meeting civilians injured in the shelling at the Government Medical College Hospital here.

Omar strongly condemned the firing and said, “Either we are unable to understand Pakistan’s motive behind the increase in the incidents of ceasefire violations or the internal situation in Pakistan is so bad that by targeting Indian side they want to divert the attention of their own people from their internal turmoil.”
The Chief Minister said that at a time when people of Jammu and Kashmir should be getting Eid greetings from the Pakistan side, the Pakistani army has gifted them with bombs.
“There was no reason to violate the ceasefire. It was a deliberate attempt from the Pakistani side to target the civilian areas. The death and injury to so many innocent civilians is a part of their nefarious designs,” he said.

Two time BMC corporator and daughter of gangster-turned-politician Arun Gulab Ahir, Geeta Gawli will be contesting in the Byculla constituency, as she stands for Akhil Bhartiya Sena, the political party founded by her father. In Byculla’s cluttered lanes, which saw her father rise from a mill worker to a feared gangster under the alias ‘daddy’, SSC educated Geeta and her party workers are busy devising campaign strategies including using social media tools try to reach out.
Excerpts from an interview with Tabassum Barnagarwala:
You are known as ‘Daddy’s’ daughter. This projected image of daughter of an underworld name, will it be a boon or bane for you?
That image has been there for years, but despite that I have been elected as a corporator twice. In fact, I am fortunate I am his daughter because he has done a lot of work in this constituency. I am carrying it forward now. Because of his image, people know me and also know that my father will help everyone with any work they have. (smiles) The fact that I am a don’s daughter will not pose a problem in this election, it will get me more votes.
What are the lessons learnt following 2009 elections in which ABS lost to Congress’ Madhu Chavan?
That time the situation was different. My father had got arrested and our office remained shut for a brief period. Our connection with the local people was lost. Now to reach out to those 2.5 lakh people in Byculla, I am doing door-to-door campaigning. I am not tackling a particular community like Muslim or Marathis even though there is 30-35 per cent Muslim concentration. Everyone is equal to me and this time I will work for all communities to increase vote share.
What are the issues you are going to focus on?
I am not specifically focusing on any issue. I will take up issues as and when I am told about it. Daddy has done a lot of work already. But in the last five years our party has lost touch. So I will try to fill that gap. Our manifesto however focuses on women safety, health and sanitation.
You are currently public health committee chairman. If you become MLA, what will you work on?
I have inducted over 2,000 health workers since 2010 in the civic body. My work in health was focused on malaria and dengue control too. If I become the MLA, I will sensitise people on health and hygiene. Residents throw garbage on roads which keeps piling up. I will mobilize private players in waste management because BMC is already understaffed and cannot keep a check in the entire city daily. May be I will involve NGOs in this work. Sanitation practices must be taught continued…

Breaching the ceasefire for the 17th time this month, Pakistan Rangers targeted 40 Border Out Posts and 25 border hamlets by resorting to heavy mortar shelling and firing along the International Border (IB) in Jammu and Samba districts of Jammu and Kashmir, leaving three persons injured.
BSF troops gave a befitting reply to four ceasefire violations by Pakistan resulting in exchanges, which are still on in some areas.
“Pakistani Rangers again resorted to unprovoked mortar shelling and heavy firing on BSF posts along the International Border since 2100 hours last night,” BSF spokesman Vinood Yadav said on Tuesday.
“As many as 40 BSF BoPs were affected by the firing from Pakistan side”, he said, adding that firing and shelling was targeted on areas along IB in Arnia, R.S. Pura, Kanachak and Pargwal sub-sectors along IB in Jammu and Samba districts.
Giving further details, he said almost all the BSF posts in Kanachak and Pargwal were targeted by the Pakistan Rangers.
BSF Posts in Arnia and R.S. Pura sub-sectors were also targeted by the enemy, the spokesman said.
“BSF troops at all the places gave a strong and befitting reply to firing from Pakistan”, the spokesman said, adding that firing in some places, particularly Pargwal is still on.
“There is no loss of life or damage to BSF,” he added.
There has been heavy firing and mortar shelling on 20 to 25 border hamlets along the IB in Arnia, R.S. Pura, Pargwal, Ganjansoo and Kanachak belts of Jammu district since last night, District Magistrate, Jammu, Ajeet Kumar Sahu told PTI.
He said that in the firing and shelling, three persons have been injured in border areas of Jammu and have been hospitalised.
Over 1000 people have been accommodated in camps overnight.
This was the 17th ceasefire violation along the Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir since October 1.
Six persons have been killed and 50 others including BSF jawan injured in Pakistani shelling and firing along LoC and IB in Jammu and Poonch districts in the ceasefire violations this month.

Market was lukewarm to Modi s America visit though experts were optimistic; here s whyYou are here: Home > Collections > Iip
Even as Modi puts India on global map, markets tread cautiously ahead of key events: Analysts
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 7, 2014, 03.21PM IST
(Analysts are not in any way…)
NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's meeting with President Barack Obama during his visit to the US last week re-energised the strategic relationship between the world's two largest democracies. However, the markets gave a lukewarm response.
Modi left for the US on September 25-26 for nearly seven days and during that time the Indian markets moved in a range with a negative bias. The BSE Sensex plunged nearly 180 points during the same period.
However, analysts are not in any way giving thumbs down to Modi's visit. On the contrary, they say that market participation remained high as trading volumes surged. But the mood remains cautious ahead of the earnings season and IIP data, which will be out later this week.
"I wouldn't say that investors are on the sidelines. On the contrary, participation was reflected in trading volumes, remains high and there is good deal of sector churning taking place which was not being reflected in index levels," said Dipan Mehta, Member, BSE and NSE.
"The present sideways movement could be a consolidation or distribution phase, which only time will tell, depending on whether the rally continues or we have an 8-10 % correction," he added.
Modi's US visit has only extended the feel good effect which we have been witnessing since the electioneering and government formation. Clearly the NDA government is enjoying its honeymoon period where despite no big-bang reforms, the markets continue to trade at elevated levels, notwithstanding the sideways movement in September.
"It is true that participants preferred to be on sidelines in the passing week, but the PM's US visit was not the only event which they were eyeing on," said Ajit Mishra, AVP- Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
"However, we feel it's just a temporary pause as the benchmark index, CNX Nifty, has been consolidating broadly within 7850-8050 for the past six trading sessions and either side decisive break would trigger the next directional move in the coming week," he added.
Mishra is of the view that market participants are keeping extra caution ahead of major events and data lined up in the coming week.
"We shall be seeing the beginning of the earnings season from Friday, 10th Oct 2014, and in addition, they are also eyeing the IIP data, which the government will unveil on Friday for further cues," he added.
Currently, the market has factored in most of the euphoria coming from Modi's pro-growth policies and also negatives such as losses to coal block de-allocation.
Modi is focusing on manufacturing and development of infrastructure, smart cities in collaboration with the US. Apart from that, he is capitalizing on India's human dividend, job creation, developments on civil nuclear agreement, and no retrospective taxation in future along with an aim of increasing trade with the US by five-fold.
As per media reports, USIBC ( US-India Business Council) told Modi during the visit that it had identified upwards of $41 billion for investment by its members in India within the next 3 years.
"This economic cooperation between India-US will provide huge impetus to business sentiment in India. Modi's promise of clarity in FDI and sensitive handling of issues like retrospective taxation will instill foreign investors' confidence in India growth story," said Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
Investments in sectors such as IT, infrastructure, energy, telecom and biotechnology will revive the growth in India, say analysts. Given the global volatility and weakness arising out of geopolitical tensions and early rate hike fear in the US, the consolidation in Indian markets is healthy and investor sentiment remains intact.
Prevailing caution in the market is a normal phenomenon in a bull market. "It can be inferred that markets are still in a bull run and are waiting for government to achieve milestones in economic development," he added.
Kavikondala is of the view that the Nifty has a strong support placed at 7,600 where a strong reversal and next leg of bull run could be expected.
The consolidation in the market was also expected after the huge run up seen in the market since the formation of the new government at the Centre. The BSE Sensex has rallied a little over 11 per cent posy May 16 and nearly 26 per cent so far in the year 2014.
"The recent consolidation in the market should not be viewed as thumbs down to the Prime Minister's visit to the US. In fact, the trip may have a long-term benefit for India's growth story," said D K Aggarwal, CMD at SMC Investments and Advisors Limited.
"What is more important for the government is that it should be successful in meeting the promises which it has made to the prospective investors," he said, adding that in the long term the view remains positive for the Indian market on the back of pro-growth steps taken by the government and improving business climate.

SP to mobilise over 1 lakh workers during national convention dayPrint
Written by Mohd Faisal Fareed | Lucknow | Posted: October 7, 2014 1:35 pm
In a show of strength, Samajwadi Party is geared up to bring over one lakh workers on the last day of its national convention at Lucknow with an eye on 2017 assembly elections. Earlier it was planned to restrict attendance.
The three day national convention of the party begins from Wednesday at 367 acre Janeshwar Mishra Park in Lucknow.
“We expect a crowd of over one lakh workers during the open session of national convention. Workers from every part of the state including more than a dozen other states units are coming to attend the convention,” Rajendra Choudhary, state spokesperson, SP stated. Workers are being mobilised from all the districts for the final day which has been named open session.
Earlier, SP had planned to restrict the national convention’s attendance to maximum 10000 delegates. Nearly 8000 invitation letters were sent to leaders to participate as delegates by depositing Rs 200. However, to make the event as a show of strength, the last day has been converted into a rally with attendance of over one lakh persons.
SP leaders claim that the convention will give new direction to the party. SP which was routed in Lok Sabha polls in now in an upbeat mood after winning bypolls.
All eyes are on Mulayam’s inaugural address as numbers of disgruntled workers in SP are on rise. Workers are not discussing the routine political and economic resolution to be passed during the convention as party hardly has any numeric value left at Delhi. Lofty claims of making villages sustainable, fighting communalism, maintaining law and order, innovative ideas to control price rise, lashing out at China and Pakistan remain the mainstay of the resolution since past one decade.
It is expected that Mulayam will not hesitate in attacking Akhilesh Yadav’s ministers which he had done in the past realising that already government has completed half of its tenure and workers are disgruntled with the working of ministers. Such talks boasts the morale of workers though ministers hardly mend their ways.
It is also first time that national convention is being held with the state unit of the party lying defunct. Even the district units have not been constituted after being dissolved post Lok Sabha elections debacle.
Arrangements done are on a lavish scale. Massive stage of 2400 square feet has been set up with a water proof pandal of 50000 square feet for fooding arrangements with delicacies from different states. Another 40000 square feet has been covered with a pandal for seating arrangements of delegates. Sound system include line array system with 24 big speakers and 93 cone shape speakers.
LED screens are there at convention and also in other areas of Lucknow for direct transmission. A big 25 feet tall bronze statue of Janeshwar Mishra will also be unveiled.
Transport arrangements from all major points in Lucknow and several hotels including starred ones have been reserved for leaders. Whole Lucknow has been decked up with hoardings and buntings. Separate media enclosure with internet facility too has been set up at the venue.

Murdered Assam junior doctors family wants fast-tracktrialPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 7, 2014 3:18 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 3:19 pm
Family members of Sarita Toshniwal, a junior doctor and first-year PG student of Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh, who was brutally murdered on May 9, on Tuesday sought a fast-track trial of the case after crying foul over investigations carried out by the Assam Police CID.
Sarita was murdered in cold blood early morning on May 9 in the intensive care unit of the gynae department of Assam Medical College while she was on night duty. While a ward boy called Kiru Mech was arrested within a few hours, the police on May 15 arrested Dipmoni Saikia, a final-year PG student of the same department on the basis of the ward-boy’s revelations.
But even as the CID was entrusted with the investigations, Saikia, the prime accused, was granted bail by the Gauhati High Court on August 11 after the CID failed to submit its charge-sheet within the stipulated 90-day period. Dipmoni Saikia was arrested under Sections 302, 34 and 120(B) of the IPC.
“We no longer have any trust on the CID. Instead we want a judicial investigation into the working of the Assam Police CID as well as the state forensic science laboratory, and request the state government to hand over the trial to a fast-track,” Sarita’s brother Sushil Toshniwal said at a press conference here today. They also sought the media’s help to exert pressure in order to expedite the investigations.
Sarita’s family also alleged that there was deliberate delay on the part of the state forensic science laboratory in submitting its report to the police so that it prevented submission of the charge-sheet within the stipulated 90-day period. “How could the SFSL delay when it very well knows that the investigating officer of the police has to submit the charge-sheet within a stipulated time-frame? We suspect some foul play,” Sarita’s brother Sushil Toshniwal complained.
The victim’s family was also waiting for the SFSL’s reply to an RTI application that they had filed in order to find for themselves what exactly had caused the delay in submission of the forensic report. “We have several questions and have been waiting for the reply to our RTI application,” Sushil Toshniwal said.

Section 144 imposed at Kishanganj town of Bihar after communaltensionPrint
Express News Service | Patna | Posted: October 7, 2014 3:15 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 3:18 pm
Police on Tuesday afternoon imposed Section 144 in parts of Kishanganj town in Bihar following communal tension triggered by unconfirmed reports of chopped head of a cow found near a temple.
Angry protestors this morning staged protests, blocked traffic and torched two motor cycles. As the area has mixed population of Hindus and Muslims, the police imposed Section 144 to avoid gathering of people at public places.
Kishanganj SP Dipak Barnwal said the situation had been under control and the police had only taken preventive measures. Additional Director General of Police (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey said: “There is no report of any untoward incident from Kishanganj. Adequate police deployment has been provided to the district town”.

India ranks 18th on most desirable place to work; US ontopPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 3:08 pm
India has been ranked 18th globally on the list of most desirable destinations to work, even as 70-80 per cent of Indians are willing to work in an overseas location, says a new report.
The US has been ranked on the top, followed by UK, Canada, Germany and Switzerland, making them the five most desirable countries to work on the list compiled by the Boston Consulting Group, total jobs.com and The Network.
The other countries in the top 10, where foreigners said they would like to work include – France (6th), Australia (7th), Spain (8th), Italy (9th) and Sweden (10th).
As a desirable work destination, India was ranked 18th among G20 nations.
The Asia Pacific region does not generate as much interest as a possible work destination as the US or Europe, largely because of the perceived difficulty of learning Asian Language, the report said, but noted “some fast growing Asian countries are starting to reclaim workers they have lost.”
Globally, one in every five participants already has international work experience and almost 64 per cent said they would be willing to go to another country for work.
According to the survey, around 70-80 per cent of Indians are already living abroad or are willing to move to a foreign country for work.
Some of the most important workplace attribute in India include good work life balance, job security, learning and career development and appreciation for your work.
The report noted that most people are willing to uproot themselves and head for a foreign country for work mainly because they want to broaden their life experience and that of their families.
“The proportion of people willing to work abroad is particularly high in countries that are still developing economically or are experiencing political instability,” the survey said adding that more than 97 per cent of Pakistanis say they would be willing to go abroad for work.
Around 94 per cent of survey respondents in Netherlands said they would consider moving to another country for work. In France, 94 per cent of the polulation is willing to leave home.
On the other hand, people in the US, Germany and the UK – three economies that have rebounded more convincingly – are not as willing to go abroad for work.
Barely a third of US respondents say they would consider the idea and only 44 per cent of those in the UK and Germany say they would be interested in taking a job in another country, the report said.

Suicide car bomb attack kills 17 in Iraq: police doctorThe blast killed at least 17 people, while as thirteen people were also wounded.
Agence-France Presse | Samarra | Posted: October 7, 2014 3:08 pm
A suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden armoured vehicle into houses used by Shiite militiamen north of the Iraqi city of Samarra, killing at least 17 people, police and medical sources said today.
The attack took place in Abbasiya, around 15 kilometres (nine miles) north of Samarra, on Monday evening and completely destroyed two houses, the sources said. Thirteen people were also wounded.
“The destruction was huge. Those homes were by the (Tigris) river and had been requisitioned by the militiamen to use as an observation post,” the police officer said.
He said the militiamen were monitoring the river to prevent Islamic State jihadist fighters coming from the east from crossing over to the west bank.
The main road leading from Baghdad to the north of the country runs through Samarra on the west bank of the Tigris.
Samarra is a mainly Sunni city that is home to one of the holiest Shiite Muslim sites in Iraq which is guarded by large contingents of Shiite militiamen

Kayani told Obama to disclose Osama s killin...Al-Qaeda
(With Undersecretary of…)
WASHINGTON: The then Pakistan Army Chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani asked the US to inform the world about the killing of al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden in a covert raid by American forces in an effort to prevent domestic backlash, according to former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.
Panetta, who was the CIA Director at the time of the raid over compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan, in his latest book writes that the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen called General Kayani to inform him about the raid and death of the most wanted terrorist.
Taken aback by the information, Kayani told Mullen that the US should announce the news to the world.
With Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy listening in and taking notes, Mullen placed the call and informed Kayani that "we had conducted a covert operation against bin Laden".
Kayani replied, "It is very good that you arrested him." "He's dead," Mullen said. "That seemed to take Kayani aback, as did the information that bin Laden had been living in the (Abbottabad) compound for five years," Panetta writes.
"Somewhat to our surprise, Kayani responded by asking us to make the announcement, figuring that at least that would leave ambiguous the question of Pakistan's participation in the raid," Panetta writes in his book 'Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace' which hit the stores today.
Soon thereafter everyone from the US national security team gathered in the Situation Room, where in President Barack Obama decided to go ahead and address the nation later in the night to share the news with his countrymen and the world.
But before his nationally televised address, he spoke with the then Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari over phone.
"Obama then called Pakistani President Zadari and Afghan President (Hamid) Karzai, and I made a similar call to (the then ISI chief) Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha. He had just heard of the raid, and his response to me was largely one of resignation," Panetta writes.
"I told him that we had made the deliberate decision to exclude him and his agency from our planning, and hoped that it would relieve them of any blowback from having cooperated. He wearily replied that 'there's not much to say. I'm glad you got bin Laden'," the former CIA chief says.
According to him, Obama wanted to wait for the DNA report before going public, but he decided to himself make the announcement after Kayani insisted to do so.
Osama was killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011 by US special forces during a covert raid.

Five reasons markets are sinking | Sensex plunges over 300 pointsSensex ends 296 points down; top 5 reasons why Indian markets are under pressure

(As per provisional data,…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex ended nearly 300 points lower following a sharp correction in European markets. Nifty has breached 50-day DMA and further downside in the near term can't be ruled out, say analysts.
The 50-share index closed at 7,852.40, down 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent. The S&P BSE Sensex ended at 26,271.97, down 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
DLF (5.68%), NMDC (5.57%), Jindal Steel (4.92%), Hindalco (4.90%) and Sesa Sterlite (4.49%) were among the top losers.
NTPC (up 1.62%), GAIL (up 1.16%), Power Grid Corporation (up 1.07%), Tata Power (up 0.93%) and Wipro (up 0.64%) were among the Nifty gainers.
Here is a list of five possible reasons which may be responsible for the current weakness in the markets:
Profit booking by FIIs:
Foreign institutional investors, which were largely responsible for an over 25 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex, have become net sellers of Indian equities in the last five trading sessions.
As per provisional data, FIIs have sold net of Rs 2583.95 in the last five trading sessions, while DIIs or domestic institutional investors remain net buyers.
On a monthly basis, MFs continued to be net buyers (US$526.9mn) of Indian equities in September 2014 for the fifth month in a row.
While FII net buying continued, the run-rate has come down to US$1bn in the past two months compared to US$2.2bn in the previous five months beginning March 2014, ICICI Securities said in a report.
"There has been lull in the FII flows in the last 7 to 10 days. It is because of the volatility in the global liquidity which we have witnessed in the last 7 to 10 days," said Sanjay Dongre, Fund Manager , UTI Asset Company Pvt. Ltd.
"We have seen a bit of volatility even in the forex market where the dollar has appreciated against most of the currencies. So, once there is a bit of stability in the currency market , looking at the attractiveness of the Indian market, the flows from the FII sides are likely to continue going forward also," he added.
Caution ahead of Q2 earnings:
Infosys will be the first Sensex company to declare its results for the quarter ended September 30. The IT major will declare its second quarter numbers this Friday on the 10 October.
The month of October could be volatile as earnings will take center stage, say analysts. At present levels, there is a little margin of safety and either equities correct or earnings have to surprise on the upside, they say.
"Keeping in mind the last month closing, I broadly expect a volatile month with bias on the negative side as we have less number of trading sessions due to the festive session break, but a lot more depends upon how the earnings season shapes up," said Ajit Mishra , AVP- Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
Arvind Sanger , Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management , said this quarter earnings are not going to have any meaningful benefit from Modi's election or anything else that has happened since then.
Slowdown in Europe/China:
Dwindling demand cut factory activity across much of Asia and Europe in September, sending it to multi-month lows and raising the chances that global growth will slow in the months ahead.
Despite gentler price rises, China's figures were mired barely above contraction, Britain slumped, and the drop in new orders did not even spare Germany , the strongest member of the euro zone currency bloc, or France, its No. 2 economy , Reuters reported.
Euro zone factories' final September PMI was 50.3, a further slackening in pace and its lowest reading since July last year, as new orders contracted for the first time in more than a year, added the report.
"The global trend, that has been a little bit of a risk off, is that Europe is in a recession and things are not getting any better. The Ukraine and Russia tensions are continuing, casting some stress on the European economy, and with China weakness there is a little bit of nervousness about the risk off on a global basis," said Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management.
"So, there has been some sell off in India and elsewhere. We could always have something go off the rails, but barring any major upheavals on a global basis, the market will continue to consolidate and for it to go much lower, it would take some more global negative cues," he added.
Lack of Big-Bang Reforms by Modi Government:
The S&P BSE Sensex closed on a muted note, down 56 points, for the month of September. Domestic issues such as coal block de-allocation and fading hopes of a rate hike in 2015 have kept the markets under pressure.
September 2014 was marked by three high-level bilateral engagements by India's PM -- with Japan, China and the US -- aimed at improving trade and diplomatic relations.
These engagements are expected to improve India's visibility in the global arena, especially amongst EMs.

The Anti-Retirement PlanBy Jonnelle Marte October 3 Follow @jonnelle

Paul Hyman doesn’t much care for golf or beach resorts. He doesn’t have a boat and isn’t any good at painting.
Hyman, 74, isn’t into many of the things the friends his age say they like doing in retirement. The things that are important to him – social connections, friends, new challenges – he gets at work. So the partner at Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, a food and drug law firm based in Washington, says he isn’t retiring, at least not for now.
“Most of my contemporaries in law school, or a lot of them, have retired,” says Hyman, who helped launch the firm nearly 35 years ago. “A lot of them were sort of happy to stop doing what they were doing. I kind of like what I’m doing.”
Hyman is among a growing group of people working full time beyond age 65, generally considered full retirement age. As of September, 60 percent of workers age 65 and older had full-time jobs, up from about 55 percent in September of 2007, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over that time, the share of workers with part-time jobs fell to 40 percent from about 45 percent.
Economists say it’s only natural that people are working longer because they’re living longer. Today, one in four people who reach age 65 will live past 90, according to the Social Security Administration. One in 10 will live past 95. With such longevity, financial advisers say, people need to be more creative about finding new income in retirement – which more often makes a job a regular part of the plan.
“The old idea of retirement of moving somewhere sunny and playing a lot of golf, that’s a 50-year-old idea,” says Andy Sieg, head of Global Wealth & Retirement Solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which is releasing a series of reports on how the views of retirement are changing. “People are screaming out for a new proposition. They want to stay engaged and be in the workplace.”
Forty-seven percent of today’s retirees say they have either worked or plan to work in retirement, according to a survey by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave, a research group. And people aren’t just staying at their jobs for the money, the study found. Sixty-two percent of retirees said their top reason for working in retirement was to stay mentally active, double the 31 percent who said they worked mostly for the money.
Not that the money isn’t a strong motivator. A survey released by the Federal Reserve in August found that 31 percent of Americans have no money saved for retirement and are not receiving a pension. That included 19 percent of people ages 55 to 64. How did they plan to make up for that shortfall? About 25 percent of those surveyed said they would work as long as possible.
Today’s workers also have greater financial incentives to keep working than previous generations did, says Richard Johnson, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Fewer workers are earning pensions. And working longer can help people sock away more savings – which more people are relying on for retirement income. Those who delay collecting Social Security see their annual benefits grow by 8 percent for every year beyond their full retirement age, until they reach 70.
Paul Brown, a 67-year-old security guard in Baltimore, says that because he’s in good health, he plans to keep working and to put off Social Security until 70. The money he makes is enough to cover his food, housing and transportation. And Brown, who worked for nearly three decades as a painter for a federal agency before transitioning to security, says the bigger Social Security benefit will be a nice supplement to the income he is expecting from his pension.
He also likes the daily routine. While many of the retired people who live with him in the senior home spend a lot of time indoors, he likes walking 15 minutes to work in the afternoons to a nearby building, where he keeps watch at night with another guard. “When I was a kid, I thought I would grow up and retire and play all day again,” he said. “But it doesn’t work that way.”
Even though he works 40 hours a week, he says, he still has plenty of time to see his cousins, go to church and volunteer at a local food bank. Retirement, he expects, will involve more of the same, with more time free for volunteering.
Another factor making it easier to work longer: the rise in education. People with office jobs or other positions that aren’t physically demanding can work longer than people in blue-collar jobs that are harder to keep up with age. Nearly 32 percent of people 25 and older had completed at least four years of college in 2013, up from about 18 percent in 1983, according to Census Bureau data. In 1940, just under 5 percent of people 25 and older had completed that much schooling.
Job flexibility helps. John Lowe, an energy law professor at Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law in Dallas, says his flexible schedule is one of the main reasons he works full time at 73. Between summer breaks and winter holidays, he says he can teach abroad and take extended trips with his family.
The job also allows for longer breaks. On sabbatical for the fall semester, Lowe first spent a few months over the summer in Maine, where he spent afternoons sailing on his 36-foot boat. He is now in Thailand teaching a short course in petroleum law. When that’s over, he’ll travel with his wife and daughter.
In the spring, Lowe will return to his full-time job on campus, where he will teach two courses and guide students conducting research projects. Even with the full course load, he can sneak away early some afternoons for the occasional round of golf. “It’s not a hard job,” he says. “The culture of university is such that elderly people are respected and given a lot of support - and it’s fun.”
Of course, some people who intend to keep working are forced to retire early when their health changes. According to another Merrill Lynch and Age Wave survey, 86 percent of people over 65 say they have chronic conditions , including heart disease, diabetes, cancer and arthritis. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said they had to retire early because of a health reason.
For workers still in good health, especially those who like their work and are in well-paying jobs, there is little reason to stop. “There’s a big opportunity cost to retiring,” says Sara Rix, an analyst with the AARP Public Policy Institute who studies labor trends for older workers. “If they retire they lose a lot of money.”
Hyman, who started his law career with the Food and Drug Administration, is one of two founding partners still at the firm. (The other, who fellow partners used to call “the kid” because he is several years younger, is in his 60s.) One passed away, and another retired to Florida, where he takes pictures of birds and plays golf.
Hyman says he normally gets to the office about 9:30 a.m. and leaves most days by 7 p.m. While he doesn’t spend his days in court anymore, he still talks frequently with clients, consulting them and other lawyers at the firm about the language that should be used on ads and product labels – a part of the job he really enjoys.
Between the money he has saved in his 401(k) and other outside investments that have done well, Hyman says he could retire today if he needed to. Retiring will lead to a pay cut, but because his house and cars are paid off, he thinks he’ll be able to cover his expenses just fine. In the meantime, he’ll keep saving.
When Hyman and his fellow partners entered their 50s, they instituted a mandatory retirement policy under which the firm’s lawyers over the age of 70 would need to be approved each year by the board. Hyman has been cleared three times without issue. “Now, it won’t last forever,” he said one recent afternoon while sitting in his corner office. “Something will happen.”
“One of two things – one will be physical and the other will be mental,” he says, adding that an emotional change may make him feel ready for something new. “Something may set me off.”
For now, that day seems far away. Maybe it’s in his genes, he says. After all, his father, who was on a tax appeals board in Atlantic City, didn’t retire until he was 84.

Walt Disney Rescues Euro Disney With $1.3 Billion Funding DealYou are here: Home Corporates
Walt Disney Rescues Euro Disney With $1.3 Billion Funding Deal
Reuters | Updated On: October 06, 2014 18:04 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
London/Paris: Walt Disney Co has come to the rescue of its loss-making subsidiary Euro Disney with a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) funding deal announced on Monday, which could give the US group total control over Europe's biggest tourist attraction.
The deal includes a rights issue and debt restructuring which will inject 420 million euro in cash into the Euro Disney group and eliminate 600 million euros of its debt owed to Walt Disney via an equity swap.
Euro Disney is currently 40 per cent owned by Walt Disney and 10 per cent by the Saudi prince AlWaleed bin Talal with the rights issue to raise 351 million euros open to all shareholders but backed by Walt Disney, which will be required to make a tender offer for the whole company.
Twenty miles east of Paris, the resort has struggled amid the economic downturn in Europe, with attendances down by 700,000 to 800,000 visitors at just over 14 million visitors in the last year. At the same time its total debt of 1.75 billion euros which is owed to Walt Disney has hampered its ability to invest in upgrades to the park.
The company said it estimates that revenue for the year just ended on September 30 fell by up to 3 per cent to 1.27 billion euros while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) dipped to 110-120 million euros from 144 million and net losses rose to between 110-120 million euros from 78 million.
"This proposal to recapitalise the Euro Disney Group is essential to improve our financial health and enable us to continue making investments in the resort that enhance the guest experience," company president Tom Wolber said in a statement.
Under the plan, shareholders are to be offered nine new shares for every one held for 1 euro a share, raising 351 million euros. The company said the rights offer price represented a 20 per cent discount to Friday's closing price, adjusted for the issuance of the new shares.
In addition, shareholders will have the option to buy some of the shares issued in the debt conversion at 1.25 euros a share to avoid diluting their stakes. The company's debt will fall to 998 million euros, taking the company's balance sheet from a negative equity position of around 200 million euros at the end of September to positive equity of 800 million.
Depending on shareholder uptake of the rights issue and debt swap, the company said there was a small chance that the listed entity could be removed from the stock market.
Shares in Euro Disney were down 13.6 per cent at 2.99 euros by 1045 GMT as investors digested the mooted changes.
"The objective of this operation is to strengthen Euro Disney, not to de-list it from the stock market," Finance Director Mark Stead told Reuters.
"Everything has been done to help convince shareholders to support the operation and subscribe to the capital increase so as to accompany Walt Disney in developing the company."
Stead said that the level of Walt Disney's holding in Euro Disney after the capital increase and debt restructuring will be determined by how many other shareholders take up the share offers.
AlWaleed bin Talal has not yet decided whether to subscribe to the share capital increase.
"I spoke to the Prince this morning, he welcomed the transaction but he hasn't yet taken a stand on which way he wants to go, he'll be coming back to us in about a week's time," said Stead.
Euro Disney had a market capitalisation of 137 million euros at Friday's close. After the share sale and debt restructuring, the market capitalisation of Euro Disney will be roughly 980 million euros, said a company spokesman.
Euro Disney expects to complete the share sale and debt restructuring in the first half of next year.

Global Banks Join Hands to Set Up One-stop Bond ShopDDA Housing Scheme: Draw to be Held on Tuesday
A group of 12 global banks are working together to set up a one-stop bond shop for buyers and sellers of corporate bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The initiative, called "Neptune," will not be for executing trades, rather it will link up banks and investors in the market and potentially some of the existing trading platforms they use, the newspaper reported.
The banks, which include BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings and JP Morgan Chase & Co, are set to pay 30,000 pounds($47,934) each for the first phase of consultancy work, the WSJ said.
AXA Investment Managers and Schroders Plc also are involved in the discussions, the report said citing executives at those firms, alongside a dozen or so other money managers.
Bond liquidity has all but dried up for corporate issues after new regulations and capital requirements forced Wall Street banks to slash their inventories of fixed-income products following the financial crisis.
The lack of liquidity also means funds may have trouble selling bonds in the event interest rates rise and the investors who have sunk about $1.2 trillion in net deposits into long-term bond funds since the end of 2004 head for the exits.
Neptune is the latest in a string of attempts to make corporate-bond trading more efficient. Investors have complained about a growing disparity between trading volumes in new and old bonds, the report said.
JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and HSBC did not immediately respond to emails seeking comments on the report.

Listing Could Value Jimmy Choo at Up to $1.1 Billion
Reuters | Updated On: October 06, 2014 20:39 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
London/Paris: Luxury shoe maker Jimmy Choo is on course to join London's main stock market next week with a value of up to $1.1 billion, industry sources said, citing the initial price range quoted by banks arranging the sale.
The company, whose shoes are worn by celebrities across the globe and cost several hundred pounds a pair, is hoping to sidestep the turmoil that has hit some luxury brands following pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong by pointing to its industry-beating sales growth and expansion plans in Asia.
But some investors remain to be convinced, expressing concerns about the comparatively high proportion of revenues it invests in capital spending, as well as its debt levels.
"Jimmy Choo is a great brand with good growth potential but it has a high capital expenditure ratio and usually we prefer fashion companies with stronger balance sheets," said Andrea Gerst, who helps manage the Julius Baer Luxury Goods Fund with 330 million euros ($414 million) under management.
"Also, given it is a small company, their growth rates are not amazing, relatively speaking," she said, adding her firm had not decided yet whether to buy Jimmy Choo shares.
Jimmy Choo started marketing to institutional investors in London on Monday and will then go on to Paris, Frankfurt and the United States, a source close to the matter told Reuters.
The share pricing is scheduled for October 17 with trading expected to start on October 20, the source added.
Books opened with an initial price range of 140-180 pence a share, which would mean an equity value for the company of 546-702 million pounds ($873 million-$1.12 billion), other industry sources said.
With a plan to list 25 per cent of the company, the minimum required, that would put the offering size at 136-175 million pounds, before any over-allotment option is exercised, which could see further shares sold.
Founded in the 1990s by Malaysian bespoke shoe maker Jimmy Choo, the company went through several private equity owners before being bought for more than 500 million pounds in 2011 by JAB, the investment arm of Germany's billionaire Reimann family.
Jimmy Choo, which shot to global prominence through the US fictional television series Sex and the City, is coming to market at a difficult time for the luxury goods industry, with the Ukraine crisis hitting demand in Russia and the Hong Kong demonstrations adding to concerns about a slowdown in China.
Shares in industry leader LVMH and Gucci-owner Kering have lost 7-9 per cent of their value since early September while Richemont, owner of jewellers Cartier, is down more than 12 per cent.
Richemont warned last month of flagging Asian demand and analysts expect LVMH to publish lacklustre third-quarter sales on October 14, a few days before Jimmy Choo is due to be priced.
Track record
Jimmy Choo hopes to woo investors with its potential in Asia, particularly in China where it has 11 shops and aims to open five a year to bring the total to about 30.
It believes it can continue to be perceived as a desirable, niche high-end shoe maker despite its expansion plans, even though demand for brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci has suffered because consumers started to regard them as ubiquitous.
Prada was one of the most active luxury brands opening shops last year and now some analysts fear it has become already a little over-stretched. Last month, it warned it would have no growth this year and its shares have lost more than 13 per cent since early September.
Jimmy Choo, which recently opened a flagship store in London, had 120 directly operated shops as of the end of June and has said it plans to open 10-15 shops a year until 2016.
By comparison, Prada opened 47 shops in 2013 and the brand had 330 directly operated shops at the beginning of the year.
In the past two years, Jimmy Choo's same-store sales have reached 6-7 per cent growth, with strong demand in the United States and Japan. It made adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 46.9 million pounds on revenue of 281.5 million in 2013. In the first half of 2014, revenue reached 150.2 million and EBITDA 27.6 million.
The company said overall sales growth in the first half was 9.4 per cent, with a like-for-like increase of 2.2 per cent which was hit by store renovations and the roll-out of a new format.
Jimmy Choo has been investing around 8 percent of its sales in capital expenditure while the industry standard is around 5 per cent and it has an estimated net debt to EBITDA ratio of more than 3.5 times for 2014 -- which is significantly above big groups such as Kering and LVMH with ratios below 2 per cent.
The company is estimated to have more than 100 million pounds of debt, one of the sources said.
But the brand will argue its future growth rates will likely remain above the industry as its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the past five years has been 10-12 per cent. Its average annual sales growth has hovered around 15 per cent in the past three years alone, the source added.
BoA Merrill Lynch is lead managing the listing, with HSBC as joint bookrunner and BHF-BANK as co-lead manager.

Jilted Apple partner files for bankruptcyJilted Apple 'sapphire' glass partner files for bankruptcy

GT Advanced Technologies (GTAT) , the company jilted by Apple (AAPL) in bringing hardened “sapphire” glass to iPhones, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday.
Shares of the company dropped $10.13, or 92%, to 92 cents a share.
Investors widely speculated GT Advanced would be providing special durable glass for the iPhone 6. But after the announcement of the new phone, investors were stunned that GT’s material was noticeably left out. Shares of GT Advanced lost more than a third of their value since the Apple announcement. Apple decided to use hardened glass from GT Advanced rival Corning instead.
GT Advanced reported revenue of $58 million during the quarter ending June 2014, down 65% from the same period a year ago. The company lost $86.4 million during the June quarter.
The downfall of GT Advanced underscores the risky proposition of relying too much on a big, powerful company like Apple. GT was already in a difficult financial condition, but its only savior was the contract with Apple, says Nicholas Yee, analyst at stock research firm Gradient Analytics. “Bookings and backlog were all trending highly negative, company had massive inventory issues,” Yee says.
Yee says Apple had been planning to use GT’s so-called sapphire glass in the iPhone 6. But manufacturing issues were a problem and prompted Apple to choose another glass vendor.
Investors had plenty of warning of the company’s troubles, if they knew where to look, Yee says. Officers and directors have been selling the stock, even before the negative announcements. “A big red flag has always been the insider selling with this name,” Yee says.
“I found it highly nefarious that management continued to sell at highs for the stock around $18-$20,” Yee says. “Specifically, the CEO sold about 75% of his total share amount from the end of last year until this summer when the stock was still at highs.”

In the Digital Diplomacy Battle  the Upstarts Will Start to Win Outreddit
In the digital world, the momentum is always with the upstarts. They are the gamechangers.
Once upon a time, Amazon were upstarts and the people who changed the rules of book retailing -- now, for good or (mostly) ill,  they are the gatekeepers of the book industry.  For TV, Netflix are the ones who are shifting the goalposts. In news media, look to Buzzfeed.
Right across the digital spectrum, it is the newbies who end up re-writing how content and services are delivered..
So could the same happen in diplomacy? Could a digitally adept nation change the rules of public engagement and become an influence far beyond their physical and financial resources? Why not?
For one thing, the digital diplomacy space needs positive presences. In some ways, it has become a slightly moribund arena, with innovation at a premium. It's a digital cliché, of course, but diplomacy needs its disruptors.
In recent years, digital diplomacy has become communications heavy, dependent on social media, but light on bright ideas, and there has been something of a minor vacuum, into which others have moved. At the extreme end, this has included the Israeli armed forces tweeting warnings/threats to those in the Gaza strip , and, of course, the grotesque propaganda of ISIS forces.
In the face of such extremes, the established players in digital diplomatic circles look a little tired, concentrating on upbeat communications, rather than invention or function, to look beyond the outputs of soft power and more towards digital as a driver of new relationships, with states and non-state actors, that can help create new policies. The time is right for new countries to step into that world and punch way above their weight, gaining influence above and beyond their more risk averse counterparts.
Take Kosovo, the drivers of a Progressive Nation Building event next week in Washington . Kosovo declared independence in 2008 but was not recognised by around half of the world's nation (including Russia). A campaign of digital diplomacy, and old-fashioned lobbying, led by the estimable deputy foreign minister Petrit Selimi persuaded Facebook to allow users to place their location in Kosovo , and not in neighbouring Serbia (with whom they've had disputes in the past, as you may remember).
Facebook claimed it wasn't a political decision, it was a user-led choice. Their users wanted Kosovo to be seen to exist -- so it did. In a small way, social media gave birth to a nation, because of the users' shared need for community. They may be waiting for recognition from some institutions -- the EU and the UN for instance -- but don't make the mistake of thinking that Facebook recognition is the runt of that litter. The EU and UN may hold the levers of economic and political influence, but Facebook hold the levers of information.
Kosovo isn't the only country to appear on radars that would be otherwise beyond their reach. Carl Bildt's tireless, and inventive use of Twitter, made him, until recently, the only Swedish foreign minister of living memory to have a policy, and personal impact, beyond that which his country has traditionally managed.
Unlikely as it may seem, Iran too has found firm digital ground, not least with its use of social media. President Rouhani has, seemingly, found time to tweet both to all and sundry and to foreign leaders and managed to humanise the world's view of his government. The Twitter account @MeetIran openly admits it is 'dedicated to providing a more nuanced idea of #Iran. One tweet at a time', which has, shamefully, prompted one blogger to coin the word "Twipoganda".
On a more granular level, and proving that people react better to other people than to organisations, the likes of British Ambassador Tom Fletcher in Beirut have shown that creating networks and improving communications ('talking to people' in old money) can reap dividends in terms of the access and influence it engenders.
But while there are exemplars of good practice amongst countries big and small, sustained excellence has not been reached for some time. The opportunity is there, and its one that's worth taking, the prize is an important one.
The big shift that digital diplomacy can give us is not that governments can communicate regularly on new platforms, it's that they can do so with new groupings. Digital platforms enable people to group together for reasons other than mere geography and created bonds determined by something other than the traditional sense of nationhood. Some might be yolked together by region, rather than nation, or by religion, by economics, by gender, or by ideas. In the digital sphere, these groupings are every bit as legitimate, and often more vocal, than groupings decided by borders and flags.
Many can still dismiss these groups as "interest groups". Or fanatics. Or extremists. Pick your dismissive group noun of choice.  And then look at ISIS and stop being so dismissive.
These groups do not have the mechanics of traditional diplomacy, the ability to match ambassador to ambassador and to share the same arcane procedures. In this new world, a diplomat's clients are changing. Post-digital, post Arab Spring, and in a time of ISIS and Boko Harem, a diplomat is looking at groups which are based around a whole new set of values and loyalties that are not related to those borders drawn hundreds of years ago. Indeed, some members of those interest groups/fanatics/extremists are in your own country. In Woolwich for example.
Those who the diplomat must engage with have shape-shifted and hard diplomacy is difficult with people who don't share the same view of the rule of law; soft power is harder when faced with al Qaeda members in Arsenal shirts, and digital diplomacy is harder when groupings are fluidly forming in public and hidden areas of the web.
But a diplomat has to engage with these groups -- because they are possible challenges to the nation that he/she represents. There's a few challenges -- you have to find them first. And you have to engage with them when they have no duty to engage with you. A diplomat's job description, effectively, includes 'speak to other diplomats, foreign ones included' in amongst the list of core tasks. But a fluid group of people who have gathered round an abstract idea don't have any contract or job description, they don't wear white shirts and dark ties, and they may not want to respond, or converse in the way you want to. Where's the treaty, the protocols, the agreements, the furniture of diplomacy?
While we are in a period of change, it's only just beginning, the notion of nation still remains hugely strong. A diplomat can legitimately call on that concept as their main job. But it's altering and the speed of change is increasing. A diplomat is facing a different set of challenges and dealing with them will require a different skill-set. Some will have it, some do have it - but many do not. Digital diplomacy will no longer be about a certain elan on Twitter, it will be about identifying non-state actors and the channels  of their choice, with which to monitor and engage with them to form new relationships.
And into that space, new nations can stand tall, just as new groupings can. On digital platforms, the size of your army doesn't matter (nor, really, does the size of your followers), it's the influence and use to which you put those platforms -- changing the way people think and act and using the crowd to inform policy decisions, while being, to some degree, agnostic about who you consider to be fit for connection.
Any country can begin to re-define this space, the incentive is with new, smaller nations, with less traditional power bases, to do so. The stage is set.

HP: Death of a Silicon Valley titanHP: Death of a Silicon Valley titan
By James O'Toole   @jtotoole October 6, 2014: 2:10 PM ET
 
Corporate divorces are all the rage
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Before Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, there was Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard.
The HP founders met in the 1930s as students at Stanford University, back when the area was known for its farmland rather than its technology prowess.
In a tradition later carried on by founders of companies like Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ), Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) and Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ), Hewlett and Packard started their business out of a garage and grew it into what was until just a few years ago the world's largest tech company by revenue.
That garage on Addison Avenue in Palo Alto has since been designated a historic landmark, marked with a plaque that designates it the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley."
Related: Breaking up is the latest Wall Street craze
Today, HP ( HPQ , Tech30 ) needs an epitaph. The company has already shed at least 45,000 jobs in the past few years as part of a turnaround effort, and on Monday, it announced plans to split its once-mighty PC and printer operations from its more promising enterprise software division.
HP is in the midst of a difficult stretch. The company has made a series of ill-fated acquisitions, most notably the disastrous $10 billion acquisition of software maker Autonomy, which was later found to have falsified its financial statements . There's also the fact that as screens have become ubiquitous in our lives, people aren't buying printers the way they used to.
More than anything, though, HP has been contending with the rapid shift among consumers to mobile devices, and the resulting plunge in PC sales .
That shift has been felt across the industry, with older tech companies that made their names on desktop computers struggling to respond.
IBM ( IBM , Tech30 ) got ahead of the problem by selling its PC unit to China's Lenovo in 2005. Dell went private last year after a dismal few years, while Intel ( INTC , Tech30 ) has been pushing tablets and "ultrabook" laptops.
New Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) CEO Satya Nadella, meanwhile, has been restructuring the company to emphasize mobile- and cloud-ready programs over services purely for desktops.
Current HP CEO Meg Whitman will take that role at the new HP Enterprise business, while executive vice president Dion Weisler will be CEO of the separate printer and PC business, with Whitman as chair.
Related: What is the cloud?
The two new companies created by the HP split will be roughly equal in size, each with revenues of just over $57 billion and profits of more than $5 billion. But for growth-oriented investors, it's clear where the opportunity lies.
"The PC business is a mature industry. The printing business is a mature industry," said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. "The next phase of the turnaround is to separate the mature businesses from those where they have a real opportunity to grow."
That means the end of an era for one of Silicon Valley's iconic companies.

You really do love your dog like its a baby. Scientists say so.By Rachel Feltman October 6 Follow @rachelfeltman
He's just part of the family. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)
Scientists have validated what you already knew: The love you feel for your pup can be downright maternal.
In a small brain-imaging study published in PLOS ONE , Massachusetts General Hospital researchers had women look at pictures of their young children and their dogs — as well as unfamiliar babies and dogs.
"There was a common network of brain regions involved in emotion, reward, affiliation, visual processing and social cognition when mothers viewed images of both their child and dog," the study states . But unfamiliar photos didn't have the same effect.
The results suggest that these brain networks may be important in forming and maintaining strong emotional bonds, the researchers said in a statement .
But brain response to children and dogs wasn't entirely the same: An area of the brain vital to processing faces was activated more by a dog picture than a child's face, while parts of the midbrain were more active in response to children. It may be that facial cues are more important in human-to-dog communication, given our lack of common language. And the midbrain areas could be vital in forming human-to-human pair b0nds, National Geographic reports .
These results aren't exactly surprising. For many young Americans, dogs seem to be replacing children as a late-20's family addition. And since previous studies have indicated that dogs form bonds with their "parents" in much the same way that human babies do, it's only fair that we love them back in the same way.

Flipkart, Snapdeal Sell Products Worth Rs 600 Crore Each in a Day
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 07, 2014 09:45 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
New Delhi: In one of the biggest sales days in Indian online retail market, Flipkart and Snapdeal on Monday sold products worth an estimated Rs 600 crore each even as customers complained about technical glitches, while global e-retailer Amazon continued its own pre-Diwali campaign.
Flipkart claimed it sold products worth $100 million (over Rs 600 crore) within 10 hours, while Snapdeal pegged its sales at Rs 1 crore a minute-- which translates into a figure similar to Filpkart's. There was no sales figure from Amazon which is running a three-day discount campaign.
"We got a billion hits on our site today and achieved our 24 hour sales target of $100 million in GMV (gross merchandise value) in just 10 hours," Flipkart co-founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said in a joint statement.
Sale on Flipkart started at 8 am and most of the products under scheme were sold by afternoon.
"The Big Billion Day is an unprecedented day for us as this is the biggest sale ever in India. With a range of exciting offers on quality products at disruptive prices available throughout the sale period, we have created history in Indian e-commerce," the joint statement said.
"Snapdeal had a record breaking day of sales on October 6, 2014. We witnessed sales of over a crore rupees a minute, with lakhs of products being sold in a single day," its co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl said.
Customers, however, complained of technical glitches and slow response on Flipkart website. They took to social media websites to express their dismay over the performance of the Flipkart website during the sale scheme.
Some customers complained that they did not receive their order details despite paying for the product they bought.
"Our technology team has been dedicated towards addressing errors and providing constant support to accommodate the largest scale of traffic and customer visits e-commerce has witnessed across the country," the Flipkart statement said.
The company offered huge discount on mobile phones, consumer electronics, gold coins and other merchandise products.
Under the sale, Flipkart offered Nokia 1020 at Rs 19,999 which is about 60 per cent less than its launch price.
Similarly, the company offered heavy discounts on books. Some products were on offer at discount of over 90 per cent.
Snapdeal claimed it sold 10 products per second across categories between October 3 and October 5 but did not disclose the total sales value.
The company claimed it sold a smartphone every 6 seconds, laptop every 20 seconds, tablet every 30 seconds, saree every 30 second, a pair of footwear every 10 seconds etc.
"We saw a great wave of enthusiasm from the shoppers and have witnessed a spectacular growth of over 100 per cent in sales across categories in a short period of time.
While categories like Fashion and Electronics continued to deliver record sales, the results of other categories like Home Decor and Furnishings have beaten our expectations as well," snapdeal.com Senior vice president Sandeep Komaravelly said.

Attendance.gov.in: Modi govt launches website to track attendance of babusAttendance.gov.in
(The system also gives a dynamic…)
NEW DELHI: Using UIDAI, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government has launched a Biometric Attendance System (BAS) for government employees. Attendance.gov.in has been launched to keep a track on the attendance records of employees.
Under the system, an organisation needs to register on the website. According to the website, "A back-end administrator will check the details of the organisation submitted and make the organisation active by assigning it a unique sub-domain which will be the first name of the website."
Aadhaar number is essential for registering an employee in BAS. The Attendance IDs of employees will be generated from their Aadhaar numbers. The 6 digit number will be generated based on the last 6 or first 6 digits of the person's Aadhaar number. The attendance ID will only be active when the employee's Aadhaar information has been verified by UIDAI and activated by the Nodal officer.
The employees will be required to enter their 6-digit Attendance ID on the terminal and subsequently the system will ask for finger print verification. The staff will be able to mark attendance in any bio-metric terminal installed in various Central Government buildings.
Since network connectivity is essential for marking attendance, the government is planning two types of connectivity with each attendance terminal; wi-fi on NICNET/broadband and SIM based GSM connectivity on tablets.
The system will not only help track the number of registered organisations and employees, but also give a dynamic interface to know the number of people attending office and the count of active devices.

India offers $250 bn investment opportunity ...Foreign Direct Investment
("As per estimates of a high…)
HYDERABAD: India needs $250 billion in next 20 years for basic urban infrastructure and this offers huge investment opportunities to international investors, said country's Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu .
He said the government is committed to promote private domestic and foreign investment in a big way.
The minister told XI Metropolis World Congress that began here Tuesday that the government has decided to allow Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in infrastructure.
"As per estimates of a high power committee, India needs $250 billion in 20 years to put in place basic urban infrastructure relating to transport, water supply, sanitation and solid waste management alone," he said in his speech at the inaugural session of the conference.
Over 1,000 participants, including 135 from 40 countries, are attending the five-day conference to discuss and deliberate on various aspects of making urban cities inclusive with the theme for the event being 'Cities for All'.
Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan declared open the conference being held in India for the first time by Metropolis, the world association of cities and metropolitan regions with more than a million population.
Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao also addressed the inaugural session.
Stating that more than 50 per cent of Indian population will be living in urban areas by 2050, Venkaiah Naidu this is a challenge but the government wants to convert it into a big opportunity.
The minister described governance and finance as the two obvious challenges of urbanization in India. He said urban areas are the drivers of economic growth as they contribute 60 per cent of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ).
"This is expected to go up to 75 per cent in 10 to 15 years," he said.
Naidu said efficient planning and effective urban management are very critical to enable urbanization that is sustainable in social, economic and ecological terms.
He told the delegates that Modi government envisaged development of 100 smart cities as satellite towns of larger cities and by modernizing existing mid-size cities.
The minister said the central government and states have identified 25 reforms in urban governance to bring transparency and accountability.
On Telangana chief minister's suggestion to give police powers to urban bodies, Naidu said this is a novel idea but need to be discussed across the country for a consensus.

Q&A: Book offers hope to family caregivers

Peter Rosenberger, 51, wants to offer a lifeline of hope to caregivers.
For almost 30 years, he has been taking care of his wife, Gracie, 48, who was badly injured in a car accident. While working and rearing their two sons, Rosenberger nursed Gracie through 78 operations and the amputation of both her legs. He's the author of a new book, Hope for the Caregiver: Encouraging Words to Strengthen Your Spirit.
He also hosts a radio show for caregivers on WLAC Nashville, and is the president of Standing with Hope, a non-profit organization that provides artificial limbs to people in West Africa.
USA TODAY talked to him about caregiving.
Q: How is your wife doing?
A: Gracie's main challenges stem from the severe constant pain of all of her injuries and the dozens of surgeries she endured to save her legs following a car wreck in 1983. Ultimately, she relinquished her legs in the '90s. She had several years of improvement, but for the last 10 I have witnessed a steady decline. She has quality prosthetics, but the toll on her back (multiple fusions, etc.) drives most of her pain. Managing her extreme pain while keeping her from being on so many narcotics that she becomes debilitated is the real challenge.
Q: How do you juggle caring for her and working?
A: I only leave her home alone for short periods, and never alone overnight. I have a couple of ladies who come in part-time to help me. I work at home — running Standing with Hope, writing books and doing my radio show. I also give keynote speeches, but I rarely stay overnight.
Q: How did you raise children while doing all this?
A: It hasn't been easy. We have two strong, healthy sons, 26 and 22. Since they were little kids, they've both been helpful with their mother and at times have literally carried their mother on their backs. Gracie's been a great mom for them and has had seasons where she was OK, but she has never been well for lengthy periods. They are incredible young men.
Q: Who are you trying to reach with this new book, and what is your goal?
A: More than 65 million Americans serve as volunteer caregivers for vulnerable loved ones. It's not just people taking care of aging parents, it's families like mine or those caring for special needs children.
My passion is to let caregivers know that although it is a lonely road, they are not alone. My heart hurts for them. My heart hurts for myself. My heart hurts for Gracie, but I'm not going to do her, myself, or others a bit of good if I drown in my misery.
We caregivers often recklessly hurl ourselves at the person in need without realizing we are actually putting them at greater risk if we fail to properly care for ourselves.
If we're not in a healthy place, we risk becoming a petri dish of resentment. Take some breaks — even if those breaks only come an hour at a time. You help them better if you are healthier, not just physically but fiscally, emotionally and spiritually.
A third of family caregivers spend over $10K a year
Q: What are the three "I's" that caregivers suffer from and what can be done about them?
A: The three "I's" are loss of independence, loss of identity and isolation. A support group helps with the last two. In a support group, you glean from the journey of others while learning to speak about your own journey.
Caregivers frequently are so wrapped up in the person we deal with that we lose our own identity. If you ask a caregiver how she is doing, she might say, "We just got home from the hospital." Caregivers often speak in the third person.
I want to help fellow caregivers use the "I" word: "I hurt, I feel scared. I'm tired. I need help."
Q: What should caregivers do during high-stress times so they make good decisions?
A: Wait, water and walk. The three Ws. Bite your tongue, drink water and blow off steam by going for a walk. Get some good cardio and let that stress melt off of you.
Wait. If tensions are high, take a moment before responding, whether the culprit of the stress is dementia, medication or just your loved one behaving badly. Breathe slowly until you feel yourself growing calmer.
Water. Drink some cool water and buy some time to think more clearly. It's hard to say something I'll regret with a mouth full of water. I rarely have to apologize for what I didn't say.
Walk. Caregiving creates extreme stress, so take a few moments to put on some comfortable shoes and walk off the tension.
Q: How has your Christian faith helped you through this?
A: I believe God is greater than this. I go to church when I can, and that helps with the isolation.
Q: What other words of encouragement do you have for caregivers?
A: Show yourself some mercy. You are doing the best you can. If you don't show mercy to yourself, you can't show it to others.

Two new studies have found that voice-activated smartphones and dashboard infotainment systems may be making the distracted-driving problem worse instead of better.
The systems let drivers do things like tune the radio, send a text message, or make a phone call while keeping their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel, but many of these systems are so error-prone or complex that they require more concentration from drivers rather than less, according to studies released Tuesday by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety and the University of Utah.
One study examined infotainment systems in some of the most common auto brands on the road: Chevrolet, Chrysler, Ford, Hyundai and Mercedes. The second study tested the Apple iPhone's Siri voice system to navigate, send texts, make Facebook and Twitter posts, and use the calendar without handling or looking at the phone. Apple and Google are working with automakers to mesh smartphones with infotainment systems so that drivers can bring their apps, navigation and music files into their cars.
The voice-activated systems were graded on a distraction scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing no distraction and 5 comparable to doing complex math problems and word memorization.
The systems were tested by 162 university students and other volunteers in three settings: a laboratory, a driving simulator and in cars while driving through a Salt Lake City neighborhood.
Apple's Siri received the worst rating, 4.14. Twice test drivers using Siri in a driving simulator rear-ended another car.
Chevrolet's MyLink received the worst rating, 3.7, among the infotainment systems. Infotainment systems from three other automakers - Mercedes, Ford and Chrysler - also were rated more distracting for drivers than simply talking on a hand-held cellphone.
"What we continue to see from customers is that they demand this level of technology in their vehicles, that access to music and access to calls is now a critical part of the driving experience and so we're looking at innovative ways to provide that," said Chevrolet spokeswoman Annalisa Bluhm.
Apple noted in a statement that researchers didn't use the company's CarPlay or Siri Eyes Free, which are designed for use in cars. However, David Strayer, the University of Utah psychology professor who led the two studies, said researchers consulted with Apple before beginning the study. The study used an iOS 7 version of Siri that was tweaked to be nearly identical to the iOS 8 version, which was just recently released, he said.
The systems with the worst ratings were those that made errors even though drivers' voice commands were clear and distinct, said Strayer. Drivers had to concentrate on exactly what words they wanted to use and in what order to get the systems to follow their commands, creating a great deal of frustration.
For example, an infotainment system might recognize a command to change a radio station to "103.5 FM," but not "FM 103.5" or simply "103.5," he said.
Siri sometimes garbled text messages or selected wrong phone numbers from personal phonebooks, Strayer said. During one test, Siri called 911 instead of the phone number requested by the volunteer driver and the driver had to scramble to end the call before it went through. Siri found the number in the driver's phonebook because the driver had called it once before.
"When these systems become more complex, like sending text messages or posting to Facebook, it pushes the workloads to pretty high levels and may be dangerous while driving," Strayer said.
The studies contradict claims by automakers, who have been pitching the voice systems to car buyers as a way they can safely enjoy social media and connectivity. Safety advocates say drivers assume that such systems are safe because they are incorporated into vehicles and are hands-free.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicle safety, has issued guidelines to automakers for dashboard systems and is working on similar guidelines for cellphones and voice-activated systems, but the guidelines are voluntary.
"Infotainment systems are unregulated," said Deborah Hersman, president of the National Safety Council and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. "It is like the Wild West, where the most critical safety feature in the vehicle - the driver - is being treated like a guinea pig in human trials with new technologies."
Two of the infotainment systems were rated relatively low for distraction. Toyota's Entune received a 1.7, the distraction equivalent of listening to an audiobook, and Hyundai's Blue Lin Telematic System received a 2.2.
"The good news is that really well-designed systems offer us the possibility to interact in ways that aren't so distracting," Strayer said.

Gone are the days of visiting crowded city markets for Diwali shopping. True it's time to go click click, but is the sale offered by the likes of Flipkart for real? The social networking world is buzzing with bitter experiences many online-shopping freaks had with the flash sales offered by Flipkart with some calling it a sham. Customers have accused the e-tailer of inflating prices of many products in the last few days.
For example, the price of Calvin Klein Be Eau de Toilette perfume was hovering around Rs 1,650 for the last three months. Suddenly it has been raised by around Rs 300 and is now available at Rs 1920. After deducting the discount, it works out the original price.
While Flipkart and Snapdeal boast of huge sales through these flash sales; it has to be seen how rival Amazon manages to satisfy some of these disgrunted customer with its Diwali Dhamaka Week (October 10-16).
Just one day after e-commerce giant Flipkart’s Diwali flash sale, Big Billion Day , Myntra’s ‘Cracker of a Sale’ is all set to woo you with a flat 50 percent discount on purchase variety of products like clothing, footwear, jewellery, watches and accessories Also, it assures of a cashback on every order. Flipkart, India’s largest ecommerce giant recently acquired online fashion retailer Myntra in an estimated Rs 2,000 crore deal.
Meanwhile, rival Amazon and Snapdeal have also left no stone unturned to make their mark in this race. Snapdeal was offering products at rock-bottom prices at its hourly Diwali Bumper sales on October 6. It claims to have clocked sales worth Rs 1 crore a minute, which is nearly equal to Flipkart’s sales figure of over Rs 600 crore in 10 hours.
Both Flipkart and Snapdeal have been advertising heavily for their pre-Diwali sales campaigns with the latter taking a dig at the former in of its ads.
Meanwhile, Amazon also launched a sale from October 4-6, calling it the "Mission to Mars" weekend. However, the company has not announced any sales figures as yet. It is also offering 10 percent cashback on state Bank credit and debit cards.
However, most industry experts are quite upbeat on the future of India’s e-commerce sector, which is likely to become a USD 20 billion industry by 2020.

Jaya bail hearing: Anti-Kannadiga poster allegedly put up by AIADMK removed32

Chennai: The AIADMK poster warning Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu has been removed from the walls of Chennai after it kicked a political storm earlier in the day.
The poster, threatened to hold the Kannadigas residing in Tamil Nadu hostage if former CM and AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa was not given bail on Tuesday by the Karnataka High Court.
AIADMK leader Avadi Kumar, however, said that the poster was not put up by the party.
#jayalalithaa #anti kannadiga poster #chennai #bangalore
In wake of the anti-Kannadigas poster, MN Reddy, Commissioner of Police, Bangalore spoke to COP of Chennai. COP Chennai assured that there is no danger to Kannadigas in Tamil Nadu and that he would initiate action against the miscreants immediately.
HC will hear Jaya's bail application in the afternoon. The Karnataka High Court vacation bench had on October 1 deferred till October 7 pleas of Jayalalithaa and her close aide Sasikala and her relatives VN Sudhakaran and Elavarasi, who were also convicted in the case, to be taken by a regular bench after the end of Dasara vacation. "We have made all security arrangements to avoid any untoward incidents. We have information on a lot of AIADMK supporters and leaders flocking to the city from the border areas of Hosur," ACP (Law and Order) Alok Kumar told PTI.
Section 144 of the Cr.P.C has been clamped within 1 km radius of the High Court and Parapanna Agrahara Prison, where Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Elavarasi are also lodged.
Jayalalithaa's counsel Ram Jethmalani had on October 1 pleaded for suspension of the sentence pending appeal and for her release on bail, which was opposed by Special Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh, who was the SPP in the Special Court in the disproportionate assets case.
In his verdict on September 27, Special Judge John Michael D'Cunha had convicted Jayalalithaa, sentencing her to four years imprisonment, and slapped a staggering fine of Rs 100 crore in the corruption case. Sasikala, Sudhakaran, disowned foster son of the former Chief Minister, and Elavarasi were also sentenced to four years in jail, besides a fine of Rs 10 crore each. In her petitions seeking immediate bail and challenging her sentence, Jayalalithaa has maintained that the charges of amassing wealth against her were false and that she had acquired property through legal means.

Five reasons why markets are sinking | How to trade midcapsSensex ends 296 points down; top 5 reasons why Indian markets are under pressure

(As per provisional data,…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex ended nearly 300 points lower following a sharp correction in European markets. Nifty has breached 50-day DMA and further downside in the near term can't be ruled out, say analysts.
The 50-share index closed at 7,852.40, down 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent. The S&P BSE Sensex ended at 26,271.97, down 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
DLF (5.68%), NMDC (5.57%), Jindal Steel (4.92%), Hindalco (4.90%) and Sesa Sterlite (4.49%) were among the top losers.
NTPC (up 1.62%), GAIL (up 1.16%), Power Grid Corporation (up 1.07%), Tata Power (up 0.93%) and Wipro (up 0.64%) were among the Nifty gainers.
Here is a list of five possible reasons which may be responsible for the current weakness in the markets:
Profit booking by FIIs:
Foreign institutional investors, which were largely responsible for an over 25 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex, have become net sellers of Indian equities in the last five trading sessions.
As per provisional data, FIIs have sold net of Rs 2583.95 in the last five trading sessions, while DIIs or domestic institutional investors remain net buyers.
On a monthly basis, MFs continued to be net buyers (US$526.9mn) of Indian equities in September 2014 for the fifth month in a row.
While FII net buying continued, the run-rate has come down to US$1bn in the past two months compared to US$2.2bn in the previous five months beginning March 2014, ICICI Securities said in a report.
"There has been lull in the FII flows in the last 7 to 10 days. It is because of the volatility in the global liquidity which we have witnessed in the last 7 to 10 days," said Sanjay Dongre, Fund Manager , UTI Asset Company Pvt. Ltd.
"We have seen a bit of volatility even in the forex market where the dollar has appreciated against most of the currencies. So, once there is a bit of stability in the currency market , looking at the attractiveness of the Indian market, the flows from the FII sides are likely to continue going forward also," he added.
Caution ahead of Q2 earnings:
Infosys will be the first Sensex company to declare its results for the quarter ended September 30. The IT major will declare its second quarter numbers this Friday on the 10 October.
The month of October could be volatile as earnings will take center stage, say analysts. At present levels, there is a little margin of safety and either equities correct or earnings have to surprise on the upside, they say.
"Keeping in mind the last month closing, I broadly expect a volatile month with bias on the negative side as we have less number of trading sessions due to the festive session break, but a lot more depends upon how the earnings season shapes up," said Ajit Mishra , AVP- Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
Arvind Sanger , Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management , said this quarter earnings are not going to have any meaningful benefit from Modi's election or anything else that has happened since then.
Slowdown in Europe/China:
Dwindling demand cut factory activity across much of Asia and Europe in September, sending it to multi-month lows and raising the chances that global growth will slow in the months ahead.
Despite gentler price rises, China's figures were mired barely above contraction, Britain slumped, and the drop in new orders did not even spare Germany , the strongest member of the euro zone currency bloc, or France, its No. 2 economy , Reuters reported.
Euro zone factories' final September PMI was 50.3, a further slackening in pace and its lowest reading since July last year, as new orders contracted for the first time in more than a year, added the report.
"The global trend, that has been a little bit of a risk off, is that Europe is in a recession and things are not getting any better. The Ukraine and Russia tensions are continuing, casting some stress on the European economy, and with China weakness there is a little bit of nervousness about the risk off on a global basis," said Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management.
"So, there has been some sell off in India and elsewhere. We could always have something go off the rails, but barring any major upheavals on a global basis, the market will continue to consolidate and for it to go much lower, it would take some more global negative cues," he added.
Lack of Big-Bang Reforms by Modi Government:
The S&P BSE Sensex closed on a muted note, down 56 points, for the month of September. Domestic issues such as coal block de-allocation and fading hopes of a rate hike in 2015 have kept the markets under pressure.
September 2014 was marked by three high-level bilateral engagements by India's PM -- with Japan, China and the US -- aimed at improving trade and diplomatic relations.
These engagements are expected to improve India's visibility in the global arena, especially amongst EMs.

India ranks 18th on most desirable place to work; US on top

(The other countries in the…)
NEW DELHI: India has been ranked 18th globally on the list of most desirable destinations to work, even as 70-80 per cent of Indians are willing to work in an overseas location, says a new report.
The US has been ranked on the top, followed by the UK, Canada, Germany and Switzerland , making them the five most desirable countries to work on the list compiled by the Boston Consulting Group, total jobs.com and The Network.
The other countries in the top 10, where foreigners said they would like to work include -- France (6th), Australia (7th), Spain (8th), Italy (9th) and Sweden (10th).
As a desirable work destination, India was ranked 18th among G20 nations.
The Asia Pacific region does not generate as much interest as a possible work destination as the US or Europe, largely because of the perceived difficulty of learning Asian Language, the report said, but noted "some fast growing Asian countries are starting to reclaim workers they have lost."
Globally, one in every five participants already has international work experience and almost 64 per cent said they would be willing to go to another country for work.
According to the survey, around 70-80 per cent of Indians are already living abroad or are willing to move to a foreign country for work.
Some of the most important workplace attribute in India include good work life balance, job security, learning and career development and appreciation for your work.
The report noted that most people are willing to uproot themselves and head for a foreign country for work mainly because they want to broaden their life experience and that of their families.
"The proportion of people willing to work abroad is particularly high in countries that are still developing economically or are experiencing political instability," the survey said adding that more than 97 per cent of Pakistanis say they would be willing to go abroad for work.
Around 94 per cent of survey respondents in Netherlands said they would consider moving to another country for work. In France, where the economy has been showing signs of stagnating, the same proportion (94 per cent) is willing to leave home.
On the other hand, people in the US, Germany and the UK -- three economies that have rebounded more convincingly -- are not as willing to go abroad for work.
Barely a third of US respondents say they would consider the idea and only 44 per cent of those in the UK and Germany say they would be interested in taking a job in another country, the report said.

The relentless flooding in Assam is wiping out normalcy from lakhs of livesWhy children in Assam are crying at the sight of rains

Indrani Sarma lives with her husband and daughter in a three-storied house on Zoo Road, an upmarket area of Guwahati, the capital of the northeastern state of Assam. However, the height of their house—like several others in the vicinity—did not fortify them against the floods.
From the afternoon of September 22 onwards, until the next 36 hours, Sarma and her family were stuck at home, in utter darkness after sundown, with water flooding their house and nearly submerging their car. “Water was everywhere, yet we had no water to drink. There was no way to communicate with the world except for the mobile phone, until its battery died,” she said.
So far, over 44 people have been killed in Assam, and 55 in Meghalaya, due to massive floods that were caused after two days of heavy rainfall on September 21 and 22. According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), 431 villages in the districts of Dhemaji, Kamrup, Goalpara, Nalbari, Nagaon and Morigaon still stand affected; 93,155 hectares of crop area are under water. Last week, the central government announced Rs674 crore in aid.
In 2014 alone, there have been several waves of floods in Assam, affecting more than six lakh people in 23 of its 27 districts and killing 68. Relief camps with tarpaulin sheets as roofs have been dotting the states’ roads for a long time now.
“The IMD (India Meteorological Department) had informed us of heavy rainfall across Assam. That is very vague information because Assam is spread out. IMD could do better by providing relevant information so that preventive measures can be taken,” said Nandita Hazarika, state project officer, ASDMA.
However, the floods from May onwards have been “seasonal.” One reason cited is breach of embankments on the Brahmaputra river. “Our embankments are more than 50 years old. We receive funds only to repair them, rather than to fortify them,” Hazarika said.
Given that most of Assam is agrarian, farmers are looking at a poor year ahead. While one paddy crop was harvested earlier in the year, two others have been destroyed in the floods.
In Morigaon district’s Asigor village, the bamboo houses of Raj Ali and Hilimuddin Khatun seem to be floating on an island amid deep waters. A tiny boat is their only point of contact with the rest of the world. When the waters came in, the boat was the first thing Khatun had rushed to save; his wife hurried to gather the children, the utensils, documents and the Koran.
As water nearly reached the tin roof, the two families moved to a relief camp on the road.
On the edge of the houses is a swamp, which leads to a large mass of water, with trees only at a great distance. The swamp is where the children defecate, and the mothers wash clothes and utensils. They get their drinking water from a borewell.“Every time it thunders now, we fear the roof will fly off and water will enter the house again. It is very difficult to sleep,” Ali’s wife Madaja Khatun said.
In Simultola village, one man pointed to the river nearby. “When we were young, the river was about 40kms away. In the last few years, it kept coming closer. Today, it has reached our doorstep,” he said.
Particularly for women, floods mean their lives take a turn for the worst.
Safiya Khatun, a young mother of two, explained that broken roads increased the distance to the market and schools. “Our brick stoves are on the floor. When it floods, we cannot cook. Men go in search of work and food because the crops are destroyed. But I am worried about my children’s books being destroyed,” she said, adding that government officials and NGOs visit only after the worst has passed. She pointed to a broken mangle of woven bamboo sheet, which once used to be the wall of her toilet. “Men can go anywhere (to defecate), where can we go?”
In Dhemaji’s Rekhasapori village, Bhagyaban Doley had noticed the breach of an embankment at a few hundred meters away from the school where he is the principal. He rushed out the 105 students to the main road at an elevated height. Within an hour, the gushing water took down several meters of a nearby concrete bridge, and the school was submerged. What was visible when this reporter visited, was just the tip of the roof; 33 houses in the vicinity were also submerged. “The Army and the National Disaster Relief Force came immediately. But I’m concerned about the future of these children. They see floods every year and it affects their education. Many students begin to cry even when there is slight rainfall,” he said.
The relief efforts by the government are ineffective. Hazarika said that ASDMA is pressurised to take ad-hoc measures but they aren’t helpful in the long run, especially in Guwahati where there has been haphazard construction. In several villages, borewells get submerged, creating an acute shortage of clean water. Similar is the fate of temporary toilets erected with bamboo and tarpaulin. It was not for nothing that the middle class in Assam was livid about Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi’s Rs5 crore relief fund towards flood-affected Kashmir, before flash floods hit his own state.
The apathy of officials is legendary. “Each year the government spends crores to fortify infrastructure and embankments. Yet, every monsoon, these collapse. Where is all the money?” asked an angry Luit Goswami of Rural Volunteers Centre in Dhemaji, which has been working on flood relief work in the district for nearly two decades.
According to the Economic Survey that was carried out in Assam for 2013-2014, the state incurs a loss of Rs200 crore annually due to floods. The average erosion rate is 8,000 hectares every year and 4.27 lakh hectares of land have been washed away since the 1950s.
The assistant commissioner of Goswami’s district, Dharmakant Mili, perfectly reflected official attitude towards the problem. “Flood is a regular phenomenon in Assam, and the people are used to it. They know how to deal with it their own way.”

Anti-Kannadiga posters pop up in Chennai as Jayalalithaa s bail plea hearing startsHundreds of supporters protested on the streets and shouted slogans on Tuesday after the Karnataka High Court denied bail to AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa who was jailed by a Bengaluru court in a corruption case last month.
 
Jayalalithaa was forced to step down as chief minister of Tamil Nadu after being found guilty of amassing wealth beyond her known sources of income and was replaced by her close aide O Panneerselvam. The Bengaluru special court handed her a four-year prison sentence and a Rs100-crore penalty.
 
Unless the conviction is overturned by a higher court, the AIADMK chief will be disqualified from contesting elections for a period of 10 years from the date of the verdict.
 
Celebrations by the party cadre fizzled out after initial media reports that Jayalalithaa had been granted bail turned out to be incorrect. Tight security was in place around the high court complex with police anticipating a rush of AIADMK supporters and leaders.

Rejecting Jayalalithaa’s plea, justice AV Chandrashekhara said there were no grounds for granting bail and reacted sharply when Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said he would not oppose if bail was granted conditionally. “The public prosecutor filed strong written objections but when he was asked to present arguments before this court, he said no objection.”
The bail petitions of Jayalalithaa's associates Sasikala Natarajan, VK Sudhakaran and J Ilavarasi were also rejected on the same grounds. The AIADMK chief is likely to approach the Supreme Court in appeal on Wednesday.
Citing several orders of the apex court, the judge said, “Suspension of sentence is not automatic (when an appeal is filed). Bail at conviction stage is different from bail when trial is on.”
“Corruption amounts to violation of human rights and leads to economic imbalance,” the judge added.
Watch: Jayalalithaa’s bail plea rejected by Karnataka HC
 
The 66-year-old AIADMK chief, a former movie star, has a cult following in her state and is renowned for distributing free laptops, jewellery and fans to voters.
On Tuesday morning, posters saying Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu would be held hostage if Jayalalithaa was not released from jail sprung up in parts of Chennai.
The AIADMK tried to distance itself from the row and its workers tore down the sheets allegedly put up by an expelled party member.

“Warning...immediately release people's Chief Minister Amma...otherwise we will hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu as hostages,” read the message which also bore the name of several AIADMK members.
The party said the posters were put up without its knowledge and stressed that it stood committed to the welfare of all sections of society.
 

Express LOL: Leaked conversation between IRCTC and FlipkartPrint
Express LOL | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 3:19 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 3:24 pm
It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times. Flipkart was to launch their Big Billion Day, a day on which the biggest online sale ever in India would happen. Sadly, they didn’t keep in mind that no Indian can resist a discount, even on goods whose price was steadily increased over the past month so that the discount would mean no losses.
Basically, everything was out of stock, and the number of jokes about Flipkart on Twitter made Alok Nath feel insecure. So it’s pretty likely that Flipkart would have needed a shoulder to cry on, and which shoulder is better than that of IRCTC, the original underachiever website in India?
 

Suicide car bomb attack kills 17 in Iraq: police  doctorThe blast killed at least 17 people, while as thirteen people were also wounded.
Agence-France Presse | Samarra | Posted: October 7, 2014 3:08 pm
A suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden armoured vehicle into houses used by Shiite militiamen north of the Iraqi city of Samarra, killing at least 17 people, police and medical sources said today.
The attack took place in Abbasiya, around 15 kilometres (nine miles) north of Samarra, on Monday evening and completely destroyed two houses, the sources said. Thirteen people were also wounded.
“The destruction was huge. Those homes were by the (Tigris) river and had been requisitioned by the militiamen to use as an observation post,” the police officer said.
He said the militiamen were monitoring the river to prevent Islamic State jihadist fighters coming from the east from crossing over to the west bank.
The main road leading from Baghdad to the north of the country runs through Samarra on the west bank of the Tigris.
Samarra is a mainly Sunni city that is home to one of the holiest Shiite Muslim sites in Iraq which is guarded by large contingents of Shiite militiamen

Nokia to suspend production at Chennai plant from November 1

NEW DELHI: Nokia will suspend production of handsets at its Sriperumbudur plant from November 1, the company has said, after Microsoft decided to terminate their contract manufacturing pact from that date. The Finnish company, however, will continue paying wages to the 1,100 employees till a decision is taken to shut down the factory.
Although software major Microsoft had purchased Nokia's global handsets and services business earlier this year, the Sriperumbudur factory was not part of the deal owing to an assets freeze order on the plant over a Rs21,000-crore tax dispute with Indian authorities.
Microsoft continued sourcing handsets - mainly the popular Asha series devices - from the factory on a contract basis, but with its recent decision to cull the Asha series, has now decided to end the agreement. "Microsoft has informed Nokia that it will be terminating the manufacturing services defined in the agreement with effect from November 1.
In absence of further orders from Microsoft, Nokia will suspend handset production at the Sriperumbudur facility," Nokia said in a statement on Tuesday. Sriperumbudur is close to Chennai. In April, Microsoft had paid $7.2 billion for Nokia's global handsets and services business.
Last year, the income tax department had frozen the Sriperumbudur plant over royalty payments made by Nokia to its parent company in Finland. The case is being pursued by Nokia in the Supreme Court. "Following the news announced today, Nokia will continue to do the best it can to minimise the impact on its employees," the company said.

NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex ended nearly 300 points lower following a sharp correction in European markets. Nifty has breached 50-day DMA and further downside in the near term can't be ruled out, say analysts.
The 50-share index closed at 7,852.40, down 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent. The S&P BSE Sensex ended at 26,271.97, down 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
DLF (5.68%), NMDC (5.57%), Jindal Steel (4.92%), Hindalco (4.90%) and Sesa Sterlite (4.49%) were among the top losers.
NTPC (up 1.62%), GAIL (up 1.16%), Power Grid Corporation (up 1.07%), Tata Power (up 0.93%) and Wipro (up 0.64%) were among the Nifty gainers.
Here is a list of five possible reasons which may be responsible for the current weakness in the markets:
Profit booking by FIIs:
Foreign institutional investors, which were largely responsible for an over 25 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex, have become net sellers of Indian equities in the last five trading sessions.
As per provisional data, FIIs have sold net of Rs 2583.95 in the last five trading sessions, while DIIs or domestic institutional investors remain net buyers.
On a monthly basis, MFs continued to be net buyers (US$526.9mn) of Indian equities in September 2014 for the fifth month in a row.
While FII net buying continued, the run-rate has come down to US$1bn in the past two months compared to US$2.2bn in the previous five months beginning March 2014, ICICI Securities said in a report.

Sensex Falls 296 Points as Metals, Cap Goods Slump
NDTV | Updated On: October 07, 2014 15:42 (IST)
Gold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
The BSE Sensex fell over 300 points to an intra-day low 26,250 and the Nifty fell to 7,842 because of sharp selloff in metal, pharma and capital goods stock.
The metal sub-index on the BSE dropped 2.7 per cent on concerns of slower growth in China. Lower commodity prices also weighed on sentiments. A sharp fall in commodity prices will impact profit margin of metal companies, analysts say. Hindalco Industries, JSPL and Sesa Sterlite fell nearly 4.5 per cent each.
Pharma stocks also witnessed selling pressure today. The CNX Pharma index was down 2.2 per cent after rallying over 2 per cent last week. Cipla, Sun Pharma, Ranbaxy were down between 3 to 4 per cent each.
The BSE Capital Goods index fell over 2 per cent as stocks like L&T, Bhel and Siemens were down between 2-3 per cent each.
On the 50-share Nifty, realty major DLF was the top loser, down 6 per cent. Power Grid Corporation, NTPC and Gail were among the top gainers in Nifty, rising around 1 per cent each.
Indian stock markets are witnessing some correction after rising for four straight quarters. The Sensex and Nifty have hit a series of record highs this year and analysts have been expecting a correction after the strong rally.
Foreign investors continued to remain net sellers of Indian equities. FIIs had sold shares worth Rs. 63 crore on last Wednesday.
Avinnash Gorakssakar, founder director at Moneyinvestments.in says, in the absence of large FII inflows Nifty could test 7,800 levels. Mr Gorakssakar believes cyclical and rate sensitive stocks could pause for a while.
The Sensex closed 296 points lower at 26,272, while the Nifty declined 1.17 per cent to close at 7,852.

Gold, Silver Prices Rise on Seasonal Demand
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 07, 2014 14:42 (IST)
Government to Streamline Subsidies, Cheap LPG for Rich May Go: Finance Minister
New Delhi: Gold prices spurted by Rs 210 to Rs 27,280 per ten grams at the bullion market here today following sustained buying by stockists on pick-up in seasonal demand.
However, a weak trend in global market as the dollar advanced towards a four-year high reducing demand for an alternative investment, capped the rise.
Silver also recorded a significant rise of Rs 960 to Rs 39,250 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Bullion merchants said sustained buying by jewellers as well as stockists on the back of pick-up in seasonal demand mainly led to the rise in gold and silver prices.
Besides, diversion of funds from equity markets towards bullion also supported the upside in precious metal prices, they said.
Globally, gold in Singapore rose as much as 0.4 per cent to $1,203.02 an ounce and silver gained 0.3 per cent to $17.39 an ounce.
In the national capital, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity shot up by Rs 210 each to Rs 27,280 and Rs 27,080 per ten grams, respectively. It had gained Rs 40 yesterday.
Sovereign also found some buying support and prices were up by Rs 50 to Rs 24,150 per piece of eight grams.
Silver coins remained in demand and rose by another Rs 1,000 to Rs 68,000 for buying and Rs 69,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Water projs contribute nearly 50% to order book: PratibhaThere is lot of requirement when it comes to water not only in India but overall in the world because water is the most important source for human being
Ravi Kulkarni
Wholetime Director
Pratibha Industries
Pratibha Industries  has an extensive presence in water segment, says wholetime director Ravi Kulkarni. The water projects contribute nearly 50 percent to the company’s overall order book of Rs 8,000 crore. Credit Suisse initiates coverage on the water space sector of the company.
The company is undertaking a USD 200 million project for Sri Lankan water supply ministry and is looking to close the project by the end of this month.
The urban infrastructure accounts for about 30 percent of the order book of the company. Pratibha Industries will look to stick to its core strength of EPC projects and is not looking to enter into capex intensive projects, adds Kulkarni.
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: What kind of improvement have you seen in your order book? You have a lot of interest in a Sri Lankan project, when can we expect its closure and how much will that add to your order book?
A: Our interest is only EPC contracts and we would like to stick to our core strength. When you talk about core strength of Pratibha, it is mainly water and we see a lot of value addition in our projects when it comes to water.
First of all the capex is very low and we don’t intend to get into any projects where there are a lot of capex in world now and 50 percent of our order book today is on water. You talk about Rajasthan, we have projects which are mainly water.
In Gujarat we have projects which are mainly water. Haryana we have a project which is water. In Delhi we are doing Asia’s largest sewage network of 33.4 kilometers, which is again water.
There is lot of requirement when it comes to water not only in India but overall in the world because water is the most important source for human being. Since 30 years we have been experiencing that and feel that let us stick to water because that is the most important and crucial point in coming years.
Q: Out of your total order book, how much comes from water?
A: Around 50 percent.
Q: Could you break that up for us, out of the 50 percent of water, how much is international and how much is domestic?
A: Pratibha has finished its first project in Dubai successfully and that was a 24 months contract that we completed in 21 months for which we also got an award for best contractor for quality and safety. That gave us a lot of confidence of international market and then we said, let us go and do some business overseas.
Forthcoming, we see Sri Lanka to get closed very soon. It is a project of around USD 200 million. It is from the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage Board Sri Lanka.
It is basically a water supply scheme, which includes the intake - the source of water is river and from river it comes to intake, from intake it goes to water treatment plant, from water treatment plant it goes to transmission, from transmission it goes to ESR and then distribution. Hopefully, this project will get closed by the end of this month.
Q: What is the size?
A: It is around USD 200 million.
Q: Your revenues in 2014 fell compared to your FY13 earnings, how will FY15 pan out?
A: We are keen on taking projects that have less capex and there were not much projects. Maharashtra was not having too many projects.
Q: Your profit for FY13 was Rs 95 crore. In FY14 it fell to Rs 36.50 crore, so have you turned the corner, will it be growth in terms of profit for FY15?
A: Definitely, there will be growth because we now see that there are a lot of changes in terms of infrastructure, a lot of importance has been given and there are a lot of orders that will come in other six months time.
Q: Can you give us an idea of what can be your earnings growth for FY15?
A: Whatever we are doing, we definitely want to increase it. I don’t want to give any numbers because there are a lot of things in pipeline. So definitely, there will be a positive growth and we see a lot of good projects coming in our hand in coming six months.
Sri Lanka is one and there are also a couple of other projects that I would like to discuss later on when they come to a stage but definitely we see more of water projects, we see a lot of EPC contracts coming in from overseas as well.

Moneycontrol Bureau
Shares of  Havells India surged as much as 4.5 percent intraday Tuesday after brokerage house Credit Suisse initiated coverage on the stock with an outperform rating. It sees Rs 325 per share on the stock, implying 25 percent potential upside.
The brokerage expects an earnings compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26 percent over FY14-17 as compared with 13 percent over FY11-14.
According to the report, the electrical equipments manufacturer has the strongest pan-India pan-product distribution in domestic electrical products, the goodwill of its dealers being a key intangible asset. "The company is expanding its advantage by enrolling thousands of electricians in a loyalty programme. Havells has built a strong brand by spending 2-3x more on advertising than its national competitors," it added.
Credit Suisse expects 17 percent India revenue CAGR for Havells over FY14-17. "Growth will likely be led by appliances where we expect Havells to grow at 20 percent by entering new segments and gaining market share in existing products,” it said, adding rural can potentially become a significant growth opportunity as the quality of electricity improves. According to the brokerage, overall improvement in discretionary demand in India should also help Havells.
Havells has increased dividend payout ratio to about 40 percent, and aims to maintain it at 40-50 percent. The brokerage expects its return on invested capital (RoIC) to improve from 25 percent in FY14 to 50 percent in FY17.
According to the report, Sylvania is no longer a drag and does not need investments or management bandwidth. However, the best outcome would be a potential divestment of Sylvania at a value accretive to Havells, it added.
The key risks are delayed improvement in India's GDP growth, and Europe slipping into a recession.
At 14:20 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 265.90, up Rs 6.15, or 2.37 percent on the BSE.

MHA asks BSF to seek flag meeting with Pakistan over ceasefire violations: Sources46

New Delhi: The Ministry of Home Affairs on Tuesday asked the Border Security Force to seek a flag meeting with Pakistan over continuous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control, said sources. The BSF has submitted a report to MHA on the Indo-Pak situation, sources added.
Firing has been on since October 5 and stopped on Tuesday morning. Five civilians were killed and 34 others were injured in firing by Pakistani troops on Monday in Jammu's Arnia sector.
In the last flag meeting in August both sides have agreed to avoid such a situation.
#india #pakistan #indo pak ties #loc
Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said that corrective measures have been taken and there was nothing to worry about.
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that that the ceasefire violations were a reflection of an unstable government in Pakistan.
Expressing concern over violence along the LoC, the US too has urged India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue process to address the border issues. "Well, we are concerned about any violence along the Line of Control. We continue to encourage the governments of India and Pakistan to engage in further dialogue to address these issues," State Department Spokesperson, Jen Psaki said.
Defence Minister Arun Jaitley has accused Pakistan of deliberately creating tension. Jaitley deplored the ceasefire violations from across the border and said the Indian armed forces were "fully ready" and are responding to each of these provocations from across the border.
Director General of the Border Security Force DK Pathak is in Jammu to take stock of the situation. "There are more casualties on the Pakistani side, according to their own media reports," Pathak said. "Since the new government took charge, we are at liberty to respond as the situation demands," he told CNN-IBN.
The Pakistani troops used small, automatic weapons and mortar bombs to target the border hamlets and BoPs. 29 of the injured have been shifted to GMC hospital in Jammu. Three others were brought dead, Chief Medical officer of the hospital Dr Ritesh Shan said.
"We have always been the sitting ducks on fire. The Pakistani side always attack the civilians in the area and we become the worst sufferers," said 70-year-old Bira Devi.
A large number of houses were damaged and livestock perished in the firing and shelling, said Devender Singh, who was leading a team that shifted the injured people to hospital during the heavy shelling. "People living in critical zones along the border will be evacuated," he said. The BSF spokesman said that the force did not suffer any casualty.

Ahead of the Bell: US consumer borrowing... 
October 7, 2014 06:25 AM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve releases its August report on consumer borrowing. The report will be issued at 3 p.m. EDT Tuesday.
BORROWING UP: The expectation is that consumers increased their borrowing by $20 billion in August, according to a survey of economists by the data firm FactSet.
STRONG BORROWING: In July, Americans stepped up their borrowing, led by rising auto loans and higher credit card balances. They increased borrowing $26 billion for the month. The percentage increase was 9.7 percent, matching the gain in April as the largest monthly gain in three years.
Rising consumer debt is usually a sign that consumers are more confident about spending money, a development which is good for economic growth. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.
Consumer spending rose a healthy 0.5 percent in August, adding to signs that the economy was sustaining strength in the July-September quarter, gains that are expected to continue in the final three months of the year. The government reported Friday that employers added a strong 248,000 jobs in September and the number of jobs created in July and August was revised up by 69,000. The gains helped push the unemployment rate down to a six-year low of 5.9 percent last month.
Stronger borrowing trends have been led by rising demand for auto loans and student loans. A large rise in student debt has raised concerns that young Americans are being saddled with student loans that will keep them from buying homes or spending as previous generations have after college.
Student loans have soared since the recession ended, topping $1.1 trillion in the second quarter of this year. That's up from $700 billion in 2009.
The New York Federal Reserve reported that demand for auto loans reached the highest level in eight years this spring with more people with checkered credit histories obtaining the loans. That has raised worries about the potential for defaults down the road.

1st banker conviction in UK market-fixing case... 
October 7, 2014 06:25 AM EST | Associated Press
LONDON (AP) — Britain's Serious Fraud Office says a senior executive from a U.K. bank has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud in a case of market-rigging.
It is the first criminal conviction in the country's investigation into a global scheme to fix the London Interbank Offered Rate, also known as LIBOR, an interest rate that affects trillions of dollars in loans and mortgages worldwide.
Other countries, including the U.S., are also investigating the case.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office said Tuesday it has charged another 11 individuals who await trial and is still investigating others. It did not name the banker who pleaded guilty, in line with court orders.

Funky robots display Japan s latest technologies... 
HARUKA NUGA | October 7, 2014 06:09 AM EST | Associated Press
TOKYO (AP) — A smartphone-controlled dinosaur, synchronized cheerleaders and a ping pong-playing spider are some of the robot technology showcased at the CEATEC Japan electronics exhibition.
Exhibitors used such attention-grabbing gadgets to showcase their technology and stand out at the event that started Tuesday. Sadly for gadget lovers, the robots aren't for sale.
___
A DINOSAUR PAL
TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, lets users experience a close encounter with a 2.1-meter-tall (6-foot-11) reptile without going back in time.
A smartphone application can make the dinosaur walk or jump. A shake of the smartphone prompts the TE Saurus to bark. TE Saurus also can play trivia games as users answer questions through the app.
___
PING-PONG COMPANION
Despite its intimidating spider-like resemblance, OMRON Corp.'s three-legged robot is a relaxed ping pong playmate. It watches its human opponent to predict the ball's path. Still, the robot takes it easy on opponents by missing a few hits here and there. With five motors to control paddle movement, it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return.
"This ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner," says Takuya Tsuyuguchi, an Omron manager. "We envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something. This would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately."
___
SYNCHRONIZED CHEERLEADERS
They are 36 centimeters (14 inches) tall but their choreography is flawless. Murata Manufacturing, a leading electronic component manufacturer, presents a group of 10 robot cheerleaders with color-changing pom-pons that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance.
"These robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents, in real time, the robots from clashing together," said Tomoyuki Mori, a Murata engineer. "It also uses technology that coordinates the movement of all the robots together in a synchronized manner."

EU opens formal probe on Amazon s tax practice...and
versions
BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is broadening its crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes, opening Tuesday an investigation into Amazon's practices on suspicion the online retailer is not paying its dues on profits made across the 28-nation bloc.
The probe adds another high-profile name to the list of companies targeted by the EU, which is already investigating Apple Inc., coffee chain Starbucks and the financial arm of carmaker Fiat.
The EU's executive Commission is trying to curb companies' ability to avoid taxes by shifting profits made across the bloc to a subsidiary in one particular country where the company enjoys a very low tax rate.
In Amazon's case, the company registers its profits from across the EU at its unit in Luxembourg, a tiny country whose economy depends on attracting foreign capital. Amazon's taxable profits in Luxembourg are further reduced by making royalty payments to another Luxembourg-based Amazon entity that is not subject to corporate taxation.
The result is that not only does Amazon pay little tax in many EU countries where it operates, but also that its effective tax rate in Luxembourg is particularly low.
"As a result, most European profits of Amazon are recorded in Luxembourg but are not taxed in Luxembourg," said the EU Commission, without providing figures.
About 40 percent of Amazon's revenue is generated outside the U.S. — about $30 billion — but the company declined to say how much of that is from Europe.
In particular, the Commission is looking at whether a tax deal Amazon struck with the government of Luxembourg in 2003 is illegal under EU law and distorts competition.
If the bloc's executive Commission were to rule against Amazon in the coming months, the Seattle, Washington-based company would likely have to repay taxes for its European operations, its biggest overseas market.
EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia says the EU suspects the royalty payments between Amazon's units in Luxembourg are not in line with fair market rules and are exaggerated with the intention of avoiding tax.
"National authorities must not allow selected companies to understate their taxable profits by using favorable calculation methods," Almunia said.
Several of Europe's relatively smaller economies, such Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Ireland, have a history of attracting multinationals with low corporate tax rates or banking secrecy to bolster their otherwise relatively small economies. Luxembourg, a tiny, landlocked country of some 500,000 people, has over the past decades become one of the world's wealthiest nations per capita by doing so.
But in the wake of the financial crisis, many cash-strapped EU countries have sought to limit such tax avoidance systems. Popular anger grew on reports that big brands like Apple or Amazon were paying tiny amounts of tax in countries where they have large operations.
The Commission has been going after both the companies and the governments.
Luxembourg long resisted the EU Commission's demand to submit tax information on Amazon and other cases, but the government lost a court battle against Brussels and eventually head to hand over the information.
The EU Commission provided no estimate of the amount of taxes Amazon saved through its arrangement with Luxembourg. However, Amazon said in its last annual report its overall tax rate was lower than the 35 percent U.S. federal statutory rate thanks to lower taxation in Europe.
"The favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions primarily relates to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg," it said.
Both Amazon and Luxembourg rejected the Commission's allegations that the company had received a special tax treatment in the country.
"We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating" in Luxembourg, Amazon said in a statement.

Global stocks lower after Wall Street decline...and
versions
TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks sagged Wednesday as pessimism about global growth spread following a decline on Wall Street overnight and a strengthening yen, which dampened prospects for export-oriented Japan.
KEEPING SCORE: The Nikkei 225, the benchmark for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, lost 1.3 percent to 15,593.23 in morning trading. Hong Kong's Hang Seng trimmed nearly 1 percent to 23,198.44, while South Korea's Kospi was little changed at 1,973.50 after regaining earlier losses. Sydney, Singapore and Taiwan also declined.
GROWTH WORRIES: Market players were turning less upbeat about the future of global economies after the IMF trimmed its outlook for this year and next, mostly because of weaker expansions in Japan, Latin America and Europe. The IMF expects the global economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, slightly below what it forecast in July.
LOOKING AHEAD: The U.S. Federal Reserve is due to release notes on its latest meeting on Wednesday. Investors will be looking for signs of when the Fed might raise interest rates. The first rate increase is not expected until mid-2015.
ANALYST TAKE: Takuya Takahashi, strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo, said a number of factors were at work, including the decline on the U.S. market and signs of the German economy slowing down. "Concerns about the world economy are working to push stock prices down," he said. "I was expecting them to go down even further." But he said players were taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of comments from the Fed and earnings from U.D. companies.
WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.5 percent to close at 1,935.10. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.6 percent to 16,719.39. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.6 percent to 4,385.20.
GERMAN INDUSTRY: German industrial output fell 4 percent in August, far more than expected. The slump follows other disappointing economic reports and suggests Europe's economy will not recover as strongly as hoped in the third quarter, keeping a lid on the 18-country eurozone.

Why an iconic New York hotel and a Chinese insurance company are a surprisingly good matchA New York City landmark.(Creative Commons/Chris Breeze)

The Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City is iconic for its storied history, famous guests, and secret underground train platform . But in simpler terms, it’s a big building with a blue-chip address in a coveted real estate market.
That’s why the deal struck between Hilton Worldwide Holdings and Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group for $1.95 billion makes sense. Insurance companies need to pay in good times and bad, so they’re always looking for investments that will deliver a high return in the long run. That’s why real estate is a favored asset class, especially in markets like New York have long-term value, Susan Wachter, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, tells Quartz.
Chinese insurers have more than $14 billion available for overseas real estate investment, according to a study by global property advisor CBRE , with the US, UK, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia among the favored markets. Chinese regulations enacted in 2012 allow them to invest up to 15% of their assets in so-called “non-self-use” real estate, resulting in deals like Ping An’s $388 million purchase of the Lloyd’s of London building in 2013, and China Life’s $1.35 billion acquisition of purchase of a tower along London’s Canary Wharf in June.
Hilton, which will continue to operate the hotel for the next 100 years , plans to use proceeds from the sale to buy more hotels in the US.
The current Waldorf Astoria opened in 1931, and was one of many new buildings of the era  financed by bonds  (paywall). Hotelier Conrad Hilton began buying up the Depression-ravaged debt in 1942 and eventually took control of the property, which he described as “the greatest of them all.” (An earlier iteration of the hotel, rooted in two separate but adjacent hotels started by competing members of the Astor family in the 1890s, used to sit on the current site of the Empire State Building.)
The enormous size of the current hotel, which takes up a full city block in Midtown Manhattan, has been hindering Hilton’s ability to charge luxury-level rates, Nikhil Bhalla, an analyst at FBR & Co. in Arlington, Virginia, told Crain’s New York Business  earlier this year. The hotel is now expected to undergo a major renovation. Hersh says he can see the argument for making the property, the flagship of Hilton’s luxury brand, more modern and up to date: “I think that is one of the incentives to raise capital, to rehabilitate.”
Manhattan is  one of the top five  (pdf, page 3) hotel investment markets in the world, and the most active market in the US, with $1.8 billion in hotel investment transaction volume in 2013, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.

The sale of the Waldorf Astoria to a Chinese buyer, while somewhat symbolic, is likely produce feelings in the US similar to  the stirred reaction of the controlling interest that Japanese investors took in New York’s Rockefeller Center in 1989. “It certainly indicates where the world is,” says Hersh. Hotels are brands, “and this one in particular is so prominent and international.”

Tighten high-value fixed deposit norms: govt to banksComments
The finance ministry has asked public sector banks to tighten norms, including know  your customer monitoring for high-value fixed deposits (FD), to check the kind of frauds suspected to have been committed at Dena Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC).

The ministry would like banks to make a fool-proof arrangement for high-value FDs, including due diligence of KYC details, sources said.
According to the preliminary forensic audit report, a fraud to the tune of `436 crore in Dena Bank and OBC have been committed through multi-layer system. It is suspected that there was some money laundering also.
The lenders are also alleged to have indulged in siphoning off the money (`180 crore by OBC and `256 crore by Dena Bank) received as FDs.
Banks have been advised to categorise FDs that may fall under high value criteria, sources said. At the moment, different banks have varied definitions of high-value FDs.
Besides, the finance ministry has asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to tighten lending norms, in the light of Kingfisher case, to prevent borrowers from opening multiple current accounts outside their consortium banks.
According to sources, Kingfisher Airlines allegedly diverted funds by opening a current account in HDFC Bank where it had a balance of `7.5 crore as on date. This fact was not known to the consortium of lenders, headed by State Bank of India, that have an outstanding debt of exposure `6,521 crore to the now-grounded carrier.
There is need to strengthen the monitoring mechanism as such diversion can be monitored by the central bank, sources said.
There has been a spate of defaults of which a small proportion were intentional while the rest being due the slowdown in the economy.
Recently, the finance ministry had ordered limited forensic audit into some non-performing accounts of Kolkata-based UCO Bank to find out whether there were any irregularities in sanctioning of loans.

Diesel deregulation likely by Diwali  private pumps may returnDiesel deregulation likely by Diwali, private pumps may return
Anupama Airy , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 05, 2014

Diesel prices are likely to be deregulated by Diwali, a move that is likely to benefit private companies including Reliance Industries (RIL), Essar group and others who have invested big money in fuel retailing and setting up of petrol pumps. A host of companies are gearing up to foray and re-enter the fuel retailing business, albeit with a wait-and-watch approach
If it happens, the cut in diesel prices will come after five years. Following decontrol, consumers may also see a Rs. 2-2.50 per litre reduction in diesel prices.
State-owned oil companies, traders and petrol pump dealers expect the government to free up diesel prices and align them with market rates closer to Diwali or by the middle of the month after state elections get over. And if global oil prices continue to stay at current levels of below $95 a barrel and the value of the rupee stabilises against the US dollar, consumers may be gifted with a price reduction of close to Rs. 2 to 2.50 a litre along with the policy decision to decontrol prices.
“The ministry has asked us to gear up for diesel price de-regulation... we are waiting for a policy decision that could come close to Diwali or by the middle of this month after state elections get over,” the chairman of a state-owned oil company said.
However, industry sources said companies will “wait and watch” and are in no hurry to go on aggressive expansion drives when it comes to fuel retailing, which witnessed a flurry of activity from leading players when petrol and diesel was first de-regulated in 2002.
“Global energy major BP has a tie-up with RIL for marketing but it seems that the UK energy major is in no hurry to set up petrol pumps in the country,” a petroleum ministry official said. “It is quiet unlikely that the trend witnessed after 2002 when deregulation of petrol and diesel saw private and public sector companies que up for fuel retailing, will be repeated.”
“There is certainly more caution amongst industry players this time around,” another senior petroleum ministry official said, adding that the government has received no new applications from companies. “Last application received was from BP who, too, is keen to market jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel in India but whether they will get into fuel retailing is still not clear,” he said.
At present, fuel retailing is dominated by state-run oil companies including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd.
RIL and Essar, and global major Shell may also look at expanding their petrol pump networks. Most closed their petrol pumps in 2008 as losses mounted after the government extended subsidy to state-run oil companies on sale of petrol and diesel.
In fact Mukesh Ambani-led RIL is said to be looking to lease its petrol pumps to state-owned oil marketing companies after diesel de-control. RIL had closed most of its 1,500 petrol pumps across India by 2008.
When contacted, an RIL official said that while the company was hopeful of diesel price de-regulation, it was watching how things unfold. “It could be a mix of leasing and re-starting the closed pumps,” a source close to RIL said.
Ruias-controlled Essar Oil, however, is keen to expand its existing network of 1,400 petrol pumps to 3,000 in the next three years after diesel prices are freed.

Shipping Corp  GAIL may buy LNG import carriers for $3 billionShipping Corp, GAIL may buy LNG import carriers for $3 billion

State-owned companies — GAIL India Ltd and Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) — are in talks to jointly acquire nine large carriers to ship LNG (imported natural gas) in a deal valued at $3 billion (about Rs18,000 crore).
Under the tie-up currently being negotiated, GAIL will acquire the nine LNG ships, while SCI will run them.
According to SCI director (liner and passenger services) Sarveen Narula, the shipper has the option to pick up stake up to 25% once a joint venture company is formed with GAIL for the acquisition. “We are trying to buy nine LNG ships, not through SCI but through GAIL. SCI will run those ships in partnership with GAIL. We are actively working with GAIL in selection of (other) partners. We may have the right to take up to 25% of the stake in that (venture),” he said.
SCI is currently running four LNG ships through joint venture companies with Japanese partners among others, in which the Indian PSU holds 26% stake.
“The details of the agreement are being finalised. We are already been in talks with them. Very soon it will be done. It is brokered through the government,” Narula added.
SCI currently has an memorandum of understanding with GAIL for transporting LNG from the US to India in 2016-17 wherein it has step-in right up to 26% and also providing technical consultancy.
“That is why we are tying up with GAIL. We will have the technical expertise. The funding will be through GAIL. So this becomes a new business for us. Each ship would cost around $300 to 350 million,” Narula said when asked about the capital requirement for buying the vessels.

4G effect: Call-drops  roaming woes may end soonComments
Fed up with call drops and loss of data connectivity while on roaming?
The next-generation 4G services may soon put an end to your woes as companies gear up to offer the latest technology to enable smooth connections.
In fact, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm’s proposed high-speed Internet service using 4G technology has crossed a major technical hurdle during its testing phase that began a few weeks ago — it will ensure that customers get the same data speed when they move from one state to another while roaming on its network.
Consumers have long complained of connectivity issues while on roaming and telecom operators have been grappling with the problem.
“When a customer is roaming, the critical issue is continuous connectivity. Operators have struggled, when the subscriber moves from one circle to another with problems such as call drops, low connectivity or even no connectivity. With our vast network agreements, it has become possible and tests have shown 99.95% success,” a senior Reliance Jio executive in the network team explained.
Reliance Jio spokesperson did not respond to HT’s mail till the time of going to press.
The RIL group firm has entered into agreements with a number of firms for leasing towers across India including Indus Towers (113,000 ), GTL Infra (27,800), Ascend Telecom (4,500), Tower Vision (8,400), ATC India (11,000), Viom Networks (42,000), Bharti Infratel (36,000) and Reliance Communications (45,000). It has signed deals with a number of small tower companies as well.
In addition, Reliance Jio also has agreements with RCom and Bharti to share infrastructure created by the groups.
While Airtel already offers 4G services in Kolkata, Bangalore, Ludhiana and Chandigarh and Aircel in Tamil Nadu and Jammu & Kashmir, Vodafone and RCom also plan to launch such services next year.

Special arrangement FANTASTIC DISPLAY Of powerhouse acting
TOPICS
theatre
The Open Couple is a series of vignettes with an overarching theme of a battle of sexes and sexualities in commedia dell’arte
Like sitting through to the end of a film’s credits, walking in early for a play has its benefits. Anuj Gurwara sat on a commode in the centre of the stage, firmly turning his back to the audience. As the seats filled up, he began miming little vignettes, hitting on female attendees and warning their male companions off.
If this was an indication of things to come, 71 mm Productions’ The Open Couple would have been an irreverent take on Nobel laureate Dario Fo and his wife Franca Rame’s play. Instead, the opening play in Jagriti’s Season 2014 walked the line between audience engagement and cutting edge theatre, pandering more to the former.
The Open Couple is a two-actor and one hour play that takes you inside an open marriage. A husband convinces his suicidal wife to accept his extra-marital affairs and engage in an open relationship where infidelity is the norm rather than the exception. Reluctantly, she agrees and they plod clumsily through, him relishing and reliving his conquests to her.
One day though, she confesses that she may have met ‘the one’-a rockstar singer-songwriter Noble Prize-nominated scientist. In a role reversal, the man becomes desperate while Antonia flourishes as one in love.
The play is a more a series of vignettes with an overarching theme, a battle of sexes and sexualities in commedia dell’arte as it were. Strictly for adults, it has mature humour for the most part, though it pales in comedic comparison to Ashish Sen’s version of the same. Director Faraz Khan does take the play toward new directions though, and commendably so. He brings The Open Couple off stage and into the audience, engaging them before, during and after the play.
At one point during the production, Vaishali Bisht even implores Gurwara to not jeopardize the last run of their play in Bangalore.
71 mm Productions definitely makes this three-decade-old play relatable and relevant. Some flourishes though, stand out as unnecessary. Bisht’s accent drops and reappears for no apparent reason while Gurwara’s faux potbelly serves no visible purpose. The popular culture references are hackneyed and forced, diluting what could have been a powerful commentary on gender politics. However, these are minor infractions in an otherwise fantastic display of powerhouse acting. Both Gurwara and Bisht stay in sync with each other throughout, creating some dynamic chemistry and fantastic leaps in tempo.
Watch The Open Couple for Gurwara’s opening song though; his voice is a talent that should have been tapped further in the play. Bisht meanwhile, excels in the dramatics; look out for her monologue riling against her husband. If Khan knocked off the superfluous excesses, it would be easier to see why this production garnered four nominations at the Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards.

Benny keeps the beat
music
One splendid song after another, Benny Dayal turned the concert hall into an electric dance floor
What did people do before smart phones and tablets? Paid attention to what was happening around them. And Benny Dayal made sure people did exactly that at the fun-filled concert, an event by The Hindu, on Saturday at Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall. People weren’t just glued to their seats; they danced, feet tapping and hands swaying to the lively beats belted out by his funk band FunktuaTion.
The evening started with Shakthisree Gopalan — dressed in a stylish, all-black ensemble teamed with a glittery silver jacket — singing ‘Kadhal ara onnu vizundhuchu’ from the film Vaayai Moodi Pesavum, setting the pace for the rest of the concert. After songs from films Madras and Maryan, both melodies, she sang the number she is best known for: ‘Nenjukulle’ from Kadal, which was received with tremendous cheering. At times, however, Shakthisree’s voice was overpowered by the music.
By the time she was done with her set, the audience began to get restless; two ladies seated in the front repeatedly yelled out for Benny and when he did arrive, it was to deafening applause and hoots, to the point where we could not hear him sing. Benny turned out in black pants (think Justin Bieber’s saggy pair), a white T-shirt and a black hat. Opening with soothing numbers such as ‘Kaise mujhe tu’, ‘Paani da’, and ‘Dil kabhi ganda’ he moved on to ‘Dil se’, which he cited as the reason he became a singer. The bilingual song started off slowly and suddenly transformed into a heavy metal number with a Carnatic touch in the middle. The other star performer of the night was Joshua Satya, who played the electric and acoustic guitar and also sang backing vocals.
An hour into the concert, Benny’s energy never seemed to wane; his tireless act made it seem like we were stuck in a time warp. His rendition of ‘Omana penne’ was completely different from the original — in Benny’s voice, it transformed into a jazzy, blues number that melded into a Western classical tune.
During a 10-minute break, some members of the audience (read girls) shouted out their appreciation for Joshua’s flowing, lustrous mane. Not to be outdone, some boys followed suit.
Benny didn’t restrict himself to singing; after the break he opened with the spirited ‘Chikku bukku rayile’, performed like a rock song. His dance moves were infectious, and while they don’t scream Prabhu Deva, his energy sure did. From jumping in sync with Joshua to head-banging at the back of the stage with drummer Alok and running to take a turn at the bongos along with percussionist Alwyn — Benny was just all over the stage. When there was a request for ‘Lungi dance’ from the crowd, he replied straight-faced, “You’ve to ask Honey Singh for that, my name unfortunately is Benny Dayal,” and laughter ensued.
This concert could be summed up in one word: experimental. And it was entertaining to boot. Very rarely did the band play songs true to their original compositions. The crowd head-banged to ‘Andha Arabi kadaloram’; the performance of ‘Lat lag gaye’ made the auditorium resemble an electric, happening discotheque. It would’ve been better, though, if the audience were standing up; it’s a concert where people would’ve taken to the dance floor almost immediately and the last song proved just that. ‘Darling dambakku’, one of Benny’s more popular numbers, saw the audience get off their seats, everyone dancing like nobody was watching.

Modi replies to charges  says Maharashtra won t be splitMaharashtra won't be split, says PM Modi
Agencies  New Delhi, October 07, 2014
First Published: 13:22 IST(7/10/2014) | Last Updated: 17:09 IST(7/10/2014)
Dismissing opposition charges,Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday ruled out splitting of Maharashtra and separating Mumbai from the state.
 
"Congress leaders have  started spreading a new lie. They say Maharashtra will be split. Has anyone been born in this country who can divide the land of Shivaji ?" he said addressing a rally in the predominantly tribal Dhule district.
 
"I assure you that as long as I am in Delhi, no power in the world can split Maharashtra and also separate Mumbai from Maharashtra," he said.
The Prime Minister's remarks come against the backdrop of MNS chief Raj Thackeray reportedly accusing Modi of having a "hidden agenda" to split Mumbai from Maharashtra.
 
The Prime Minister said Maharashtra is the state that has the capability to drive India's growth and Mumbai is central to that.
 
Slamming Congress for the farmers' suicide in the last 10 years, Modi urged the people to punish the "murderers" of farmers in the October 15 Assembly elections.
 
"Press on the lotus button on October 15 and make it the liberation day for the state from 15 years of Congress misrule," he said.
 
Meanwhile the Shiv Sena launched a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he is leaving his work in Delhi to hold rallies in Maharashtra
The Sena in an editorial in its party mouthpiece Saamna Tuesday also  questioned the work done by him for the state after becoming the prime minister.
 
The Sena also told its estranged ally BJP that frequent visits of the Prime Minister for the campaign was denting the state's coffers.
 
"The Prime Minister is busy addressing rallies in Maharashtra leaving his work in Delhi. Modi is a tall leader of the BJP but he has been forced to campaign in the state since the BJP has no known faces in Maharashtra," the Sena said.
Read: Anti-BJP rhetoric shows Sena has lost the battle, says BJP
 
If Modi was a "superstar campaigner" as projected by the BJP, he would have appealed to people of the state to vote for his party while sitting in New Delhi, it said.
 
 The Sena also said that the burden of the visits was falling on the state's treasury.
 
"Whenever the Prime Minister is invited to conduct rallies, many things need to be taken care of. His security and other arrangements need money, the burden of which finally falls on the shoulders of the state treasury.
The Sena also reminded Modi that the BJP had severely criticised  Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh when they used the state machineryfor campaign work.
 
NCP chief Sharad Pawar and MNS chief Raj Thackeray have been questioning Modi's obsession with Gujarat inspite of him being the prime minister, and they have only given words to what the Shiv Sena felt about him, it further said.
 
"It does not suit a prime minister to wander from village to village asking for votes.The dignity of the PM's chair should be upheld," the editorial said.
 
The Sena also questioned the work done by Modi for Maharashtra after becoming the PM, and said it is ironical that BJP has suddenly found love for Maratha warrior king Shivaji.

BSE Sensex falls on weak Asian cuesSensex tumbles to 2-month low, down 296 points on capital outflows
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 7, 2014  | 16:36 IST

BSE benchmark Sensex on Tuesday plunged 296 points to close at nearly two-month low due to widespread losses in metal, healthcare, consumer durables and capital goods sector stocks on capital outflows and retail investors ahead of earnings season amid a mixed trend overseas.
After opening 137 points lower, the 30-share index continued its slide to touch the day's low of 26,250.24 before ending the day at almost two-month low of 26,271.97, a level not seen since August 14, registering a steep fall of 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
The gauge had lost 62.52 points in the previous session on October 1. Stock markets remained closed on October 2, 3 and 6 for Gandhi Jayanti, Dussehra and Id-Ul-Zuha, respectively.
FII/FPIs pulled out Rs 63.24 crore from domestic markets on October 1, according to exchange data.
Similarly, the broader-based NSE Nifty closed down by 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent at 7,852.40 after shuttling between 7,943.05 and 7,842.70.
Brokers said the sentiment dampened on foreign capital outflows and offloading of positions by retail investors ahead of the earnings season, with Infosys posting results later this week.
Of the 30 Sensex shares, 23 closed lower led by Hindalco (down 4.35 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (4.32 per cent) and Cipla (3.67 per cent), while NTPC, Gail and Tata Motors remained major gainers.
Globally, a mixed closing on the other Asian markets and a lower opening of the European stocks as a report showed German industrial production contracted the most in more than five years, also negatively impacted sentiment. Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 63.24 crore last Wednesday as per the provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
Sectorwise, BSE metal index suffered the most by falling 2.65 per cent, followed by healthcare by 1.85 per cent. Captial goods index by 1.78 per cent, Consumer durables index by 1.72 per cent, Realy index 1.27 per cent, PSU index 1.20 per cent and Banking index 0.87 per cent.

It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times. Flipkart was to launch their Big Billion Day, a day on which the biggest online sale ever in India would happen. Sadly, they didn’t keep in mind that no Indian can resist a discount, even on goods whose price was steadily increased over the past month so that the discount would mean no losses.
Basically, everything was out of stock, and the number of jokes about Flipkart on Twitter made Alok Nath feel insecure. So it’s pretty likely that Flipkart would have needed a shoulder to cry on, and which shoulder is better than that of IRCTC, the original underachiever website in India?

Family members of Sarita Toshniwal, a junior doctor and first-year PG student of Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh, who was brutally murdered on May 9, on Tuesday sought a fast-track trial of the case after crying foul over investigations carried out by the Assam Police CID.
Sarita was murdered in cold blood early morning on May 9 in the intensive care unit of the gynae department of Assam Medical College while she was on night duty. While a ward boy called Kiru Mech was arrested within a few hours, the police on May 15 arrested Dipmoni Saikia, a final-year PG student of the same department on the basis of the ward-boy’s revelations.
But even as the CID was entrusted with the investigations, Saikia, the prime accused, was granted bail by the Gauhati High Court on August 11 after the CID failed to submit its charge-sheet within the stipulated 90-day period. Dipmoni Saikia was arrested under Sections 302, 34 and 120(B) of the IPC.
“We no longer have any trust on the CID. Instead we want a judicial investigation into the working of the Assam Police CID as well as the state forensic science laboratory, and request the state government to hand over the trial to a fast-track,” Sarita’s brother Sushil Toshniwal said at a press conference here today. They also sought the media’s help to exert pressure in order to expedite the investigations.
Sarita’s family also alleged that there was deliberate delay on the part of the state forensic science laboratory in submitting its report to the police so that it prevented submission of the charge-sheet within the stipulated 90-day period. “How could the SFSL delay when it very well knows that the investigating officer of the police has to submit the charge-sheet within a stipulated time-frame? We suspect some foul play,” Sarita’s brother Sushil Toshniwal complained.
The victim’s family was also waiting for the SFSL’s reply to an RTI application that they had filed in order to find for themselves what exactly had caused the delay in submission of the forensic report. “We have several questions and have been waiting for the reply to our RTI application,” Sushil Toshniwal said.

Section 144 imposed at Kishanganj town of Bihar after communal tensionPrint
Express News Service | Patna | Posted: October 7, 2014 3:15 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 3:18 pm
Police on Tuesday afternoon imposed Section 144 in parts of Kishanganj town in Bihar following communal tension triggered by unconfirmed reports of chopped head of a cow found near a temple.
Angry protestors this morning staged protests, blocked traffic and torched two motor cycles. As the area has mixed population of Hindus and Muslims, the police imposed Section 144 to avoid gathering of people at public places.
Kishanganj SP Dipak Barnwal said the situation had been under control and the police had only taken preventive measures. Additional Director General of Police (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey said: “There is no report of any untoward incident from Kishanganj. Adequate police deployment has been provided to the district town”.

AGARTALA: Bangladesh government has announced to create 'Special Economic Zone' ( SEZ ) for the Indian investors as the bilateral relations between the two countries have improved remarkably, a diplomat said.
"Bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh have improved a lot. The neighbouring country has announced to create Special Economic Zone for the Indian investors," Indian Deputy High Commissioner in Dhaka, Sandip Chakraborty told reporters last night.
Chakraborty came here for a four-day visit yesterday through Akhaura border here to review the progress of different projects of connectivity between the two countries through Bangladesh and transmission of 100 MW power from the 726 MW Palatana power project in South Tripura district.
Tripura has 856 km long border with Bangladesh which constitutes 85 per cent of its total border.
Following his hour-long meeting with the state Transport and Power minister, Manik De at secretariat, Chakraborty said, "Ashuganj port on the river Meghna, which is just 37 km from Agartala and carried the over dimensional machines for Palatana power project would be improved and upgraded by Indian government for transportation of goods to the north eastern states through Tripura."
He said, a government of India organisation was preparing a Detailed Project Report (DPR) to assess the cost of developing the port.
Chakraborty said, India would draw a high tension power corridor of about 45 km from Suryamaninagar here to Rabindranagar, a bordering village to cater 100 MW power to Comilla in Bangladesh.
He said the progress of laying 15 km railway track from Agartala to Akhaura in Bangladesh was satisfactory which would connect Bangladesh and Indian railways through North-East soon.
Chakraborty would also visit Sabroom in South Tripura district to review the progress of constructing a bridge on the river Feni to connect Indian territory with the Chittagong area from where the Chittagong port is just 75 km.

(American workers have been…)
By David Leonhardt
American workers have been receiving meager pay increases for so long now that it's reasonable to talk in sweeping terms about the trend. It is the great wage slowdown of the 21st century.
The typical American family makes less than the typical family did 15 years ago, a statement that had not previously been true since the Great Depression. Even as the unemployment rate has fallen in the last few years, wage growth has remained mediocre. Last week's jobs report offered the latest evidence: The jobless rate fell below 6 per cent, yet hourly pay has risen just 2 per cent over the last year, not much faster than inflation. The combination has puzzled economists and frustrated workers.
Of course, there is a long history of pessimistic predictions about dark new economic eras, and those predictions are generally wrong. But things have been disappointing for long enough now that we should take the pessimistic case seriously. In some fundamental way, the economy seems broken.
I probably don't need to persuade most readers of this view, so the better way to think about the issue may be to consider the optimistic case. And last week, in his most substantive speech on domestic policy in months, President Barack Obama laid out that case.
It included the usual set of glass-half-full statistics and wishful-thinking proposals that officeholders talk about during political campaigns. More notable, though, was that Obama - speaking at Northwestern University - explained why he thought wage growth was likely to pick up.
"If we take the necessary steps to build on the foundation," he said, after listing the good news, "I promise you, over the next 10 years we'll build an economy where wage growth is stronger than it was in the past three decades."
He may or may not be right about that. But the speech laid out the issues in unusually clear terms. And by any definition, the great wage slowdown - or its end - is one of the most important subjects in the country today.
You can think of Obama's argument as falling into two categories (even if he didn't say so): the reasons that overall economic growth may accelerate, and the reasons that middle- and low-income workers may benefit more from that growth than they have lately. Both factors have contributed to the wage slowdown. The size of the pie hasn't been growing very fast, and most of the increases have gone to a small share of already well-fed families.
On the growth side of the ledger, both energy and education have been problems. The cost of energy, after temporarily falling in the 1990s, returned to its post-1970s norm in recent years and acted like a tax on the rest of the economy. Education, meanwhile, is the lifeblood of economic growth, allowing people to do entirely new tasks (cure a disease, invent the Internet) or to do old ones with less time and expense. Yet educational attainment has slowed so much that the United States has lost its once-enormous global lead.
On both fronts, the country has been making progress, Obama rightly noted. The fracking boom and a more modest clean-energy boom have increased this country's share of energy production and held down costs worldwide. The price of oil has been mostly flat for three years.
  And the number of high school and college graduates is rising. The financial crisis deserves some perverse credit, because it sent people fleeing back to school, much as the Great Depression did. But some of the efforts to improve school performance - by raising standards and accountability - are also playing a role.
Last year, 33.6 per cent of 25- to 29-year-olds had a four-year college degree, up from 30.8 per cent in 2008, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That leaves a lot of room for further improvement, but it's more progress than in previous years. In 2000, the share was 29.1 per cent.
Obama didn't mention her in the speech, but another reason for optimism at the White House is Janet Yellen, who took over the Federal Reserve this year. Under Ben Bernanke, her predecessor, the Fed was heroically creative in fighting the financial crisis. After the crisis, though, Fed officials made the same mistake repeatedly: overestimating the health of the economy. Yellen has suggested that she's learned that lesson and will be even more aggressive about trying to lift growth with low interest rates.
As far as the other entry in the ledger, the biggest reason to think economic growth may translate more directly into wage gains is the turnabout in health costs. After years of rapid increases, they have slowed sharply in the last three years. Obama likes to give more credit to the 2010 health care law than most observers do, but he's not wrong about the trend's significance.

Vadra-DLF case: EC seeks report from Haryana poll officer and chief secretary within 24hoursVadra-DLF case: Haryana nod to Vadra land deal under EC scanner

Robert Vadra.
The Election Commission (EC), which had sought to ascertain whether the clearance given by the state government to a land deal between Robert Vadra and real estate firm DLF violates the model code of conduct, received a report from the Haryana poll authorities on Tuesday.
READ: Let EC probe nod to Robert Vadra deal, says Narendra Modi
EC sources said the report was received from the Chief Electoral Officer, Haryana, and the panel was analysing it. The poll panel will ascertain whether the deal was cleared while the model code was in force in poll-bound Haryana and whether it constitutes a violation.

Earlier, a top EC official told The Indian Express that “we have asked the Haryana CEO and the chief secretary to ascertain the facts of the case and send us a report as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours”.
The official, however, added that the EC may not be able to intervene in the matter if it pertains to a decision that was taken before September 12, the day the code came into force. “We want to be sure that no wrongdoing has taken place while the code of conduct is in force,” said the official.
The EC’s move comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the poll panel to take “serious note” of the Haryana government’s decision to clear the land deal, saying it was done “during the election process”.
The Indian Express on Monday reported that the Congress government in Haryana had officially legitimised the land deal.

Saradha scam: CBI to file first chargesheet by OctoberendThe agency was probing aspects like criminal conspiracy, misappropriation of funds and criminal breach of trust in the Saradha episode.
Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: October 7, 2014 3:45 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 4:06 pm
The Special Crime Branch of CBI , which started probing the Saradha multi-crore rupees ponzi scheme scam four months ago, would file the first chargesheet by October end.
“By the end of October, we will file the first chargesheet on the basis of evidences which CBI has obtained after a series of arrests and interrogations,” a senior official of the investigating agency said on Tuesday.
The first chargesheet would cover a part of the investigations and those persons against whom adequate evidence had been found, he said.
The agency was probing aspects like criminal conspiracy, misappropriation of funds and criminal breach of trust in the Saradha episode.
He said, so far the agency had arrested ten and interrogated numerous people to probe the conspiracy behind the scam, which left thousands of depositors cheated.
CBI had also summoned West Bengal Textiles Minister Shyamapada Mukherjee and painter Shuvoprasanna, a person close to the top Trinamool Congress leadership, in connection with the crime, the official said.
It would also grill those whose names had been cropped during the interrogation of the accused.
Asked whether CBI would be deterred from interrogating influential political persons whose names surfaced in the probe fearing backlash, the official said “We are not at all concerned about what will happen. Our director has clearly told us that whomsoever is found to be guilty of offence should be interrogated. Nobody will be spared and we cannot afford to do so”.
He said ‘serious’ staff crunch was causing a problem in speeding up the probe. “Only nine to ten officers are engaged in the Saradha probe. This is not sufficient.”

Nobel Prize for physics goes to inventors of LED light
Japanese scientists Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano and American Shuji Nakamura won the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics for inventing a new energy efficient and environmentally friendly light source, the LED.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
STOCKHOLM: Japanese scientists Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano and American Shuji Nakamura won the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics for inventing a new energy efficient and environmentally friendly light source, the LED, the award-giving body said on Tuesday.
"With the advent of LED lamps we now have more long lasting and more efficient alternatives to older light sources," the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement awarding the 8 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize.
"As about one fourth of world electricity consumption is used for lighting purposes, the LEDs contribute to saving the Earth's resources," it said.
Akasaki works at the Meijo University in Japan and Amano is professor at the Nagoya University. Nakamura, born in Japan but a US citizen, works at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Physics was the second of this year's crop of Nobels. The prizes were first awarded in 1901 to honour achievements in science, literature and peace in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and business tycoon Alfred Nobel.
As winners of the physics award, the first field to be mentioned in Nobel's will, the laureates join ranks with some of the biggest names in science such as Albert Einstein , Niels Bohr and the husband and wife team of Pierre and Marie Curie.
While the increasingly complex science celebrated by the Nobels has often been far from dinner table conversation, it has also highlighted more widely known achievements, such as last year's award for the prediction of the Higgs boson particle.

Karnataka HC grants conditional bail to AIADMK chief JayalalithaaHundreds of supporters protested on the streets and shouted slogans on Tuesday after the Karnataka High Court denied bail to AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa who was jailed by a Bengaluru court in a corruption case last month.
 
Jayalalithaa was forced to step down as chief minister of Tamil Nadu after being found guilty of amassing wealth beyond her known sources of income and was replaced by her close aide O Panneerselvam. The Bengaluru special court handed her a four-year prison sentence and a Rs100-crore penalty.
 
Unless the conviction is overturned by a higher court, the AIADMK chief will be disqualified from contesting elections for a period of 10 years from the date of the verdict.
 
Celebrations by the party cadre fizzled out after initial media reports that Jayalalithaa had been granted bail turned out to be incorrect. Tight security was in place around the high court complex with police anticipating a rush of AIADMK supporters and leaders.

Rejecting Jayalalithaa’s plea, justice AV Chandrashekhara said there were no grounds for granting bail and reacted sharply when Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said he would not oppose if bail was granted conditionally. “The public prosecutor filed strong written objections but when he was asked to present arguments before this court, he said no objection.”
The bail petitions of Jayalalithaa's associates Sasikala Natarajan, VK Sudhakaran and J Ilavarasi were also rejected on the same grounds. The AIADMK chief is likely to approach the Supreme Court in appeal on Wednesday.
Citing several orders of the apex court, the judge said, “Suspension of sentence is not automatic (when an appeal is filed). Bail at conviction stage is different from bail when trial is on.”
“Corruption amounts to violation of human rights and leads to economic imbalance,” the judge added.
Watch: Jayalalithaa’s bail plea rejected by Karnataka HC
 
The 66-year-old AIADMK chief, a former movie star, has a cult following in her state and is renowned for distributing free laptops, jewellery and fans to voters.
On Tuesday morning, posters saying Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu would be held hostage if Jayalalithaa was not released from jail sprung up in parts of Chennai.
The AIADMK tried to distance itself from the row and its workers tore down the sheets allegedly put up by an expelled party member.

“Warning...immediately release people's Chief Minister Amma...otherwise we will hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu as hostages,” read the message which also bore the name of several AIADMK members.
The party said the posters were put up without its knowledge and stressed that it stood committed to the welfare of all sections of society.

Not yet golden
Golden Rule Insurance Co. still won't pay for all the bloodwork from Mary Klinefelter's routine physical in October. But the Orland Park resident reports some progress in her quest for payment.
Klinefelter, featured in the Aug. 28 column, thought that her insurance would pay 100 percent of the costs associated with routine physical exams. Instead, Golden Rule rejected claims for much of the bloodwork, leaving her with a bill of $1,497.65.
The insurance company paid for similar bloodwork for her husband, who had a physical at about the same time, Klinefelter said.
After the Problem Solver inquired about the case, a spokeswoman for Golden Rule said the company would review her case again. On Saturday, Klinefelter received a new explanation of benefits from Golden Rule, a UnitedHealthcare company.
Klinefelter said the insurance company has agreed to pay about $276.71 more for the bloodwork.
"I still don't know what's going on, but we're making some progress," she said. "I'm going to keep working on it. We're getting there."
She plans to call Golden Rule and push the company to pay more.
The Problem Solver will provide updates as warranted.

US lawmakers forge ahead to set US-India relations on new courseUS lawmakers forge ahead to set US-India relations on new course

US Congressman Eni FH Faleomavaega
While the Administration scrambles to repair the damage it has done, the United States Congress forges ahead to set the US-India relationship on a new course. Speaker of the House John Boehner established the tone of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to the United States by extending an invite for the Prime Minister to address a Joint Meeting of Congress after mid-term elections, at a time of his choosing. In a rare display of public unity, approximately 100 Members of Congress - both Republican and Democrats - from the US Senate and House of Representatives - signed letters in full support of the address.  
Washington is abuzz as US lawmakers recognise that Prime Minister Modi's arrival is a moment of great significance. US lawmakers will meet with Modi to strengthen economic and security ties and make up for years of failed and misguided policies that could and should have been rectified by the US Department of State in advance of India's election.
As US lawmakers work to restore our country's credibility, I am hopeful that "good days are coming," as Modi put it after his historic win. India is a vital partner - so vital to US interests that I am disappointed that the Administration has only now identified India as one of its top four priorities. In my mind, India should be our top priority if we are serious about regional stability and our own security in the Asia-Pacific region. Prime Minister Modi will play a key role in promoting and securing democracy in Asia as US leadership has run amuck with Administration after Administration focusing on the Middle East at the expense of a region where two-thirds of the world's population resides and which includes seven of the world's ten largest standing militaries, five of the world's declared nuclear nations, two of the three largest economies, the largest democracy, the world's busiest international sea lanes, and nine of the ten largest ports.
FULL COVERAGE: PM Narendra Modi in US
Although I support and appreciate our need to focus on Europe and the Middle East given the complexities in those regions, I am disappointed that the United States has not devoted the same time, attention and resources to the Asia-Pacific region where we are faced with unique and complex challenges that may affect the globe in more important ways. But, I have every confidence that Modi will lead in a way we have not.
To his credit, Modi has not let his personal feelings come in the way of what is best for India or the world. In Washington, he is expected to focus talks on defence and trade. Ahead of his visit, I applaud Modi for taking a courageous stand when it comes to food security. I do not believe any country should sacrifice food security just because developed nations are pushing a different agenda at the expense of the poorest of the poor, and it is regretful that the United States is trying to bully India on this issue. Modi is right to hold fast to his position that trade reform measures must address India's food security concerns and the United States is wrong to press India to settle for anything less than a WTO pact that includes a permanent agreement.
With trade between India and the United States over $63 billion in 2013, I commend Modi's stand for inclusive growth and development for all, and for conceptualizing the Vibrant Gujarat brand which has meaningfully contributed to India's growth. What began as an investors summit has now evolved into a platform for knowledge sharing and social and business transformation .
I applaud Sanjay Puri, CEO of the Alliance for US-India Business (AUSIB), for the prominent work he did to bring Vibrant Gujarat to the attention of US lawmakers at a time when Modi was Chief Minister. Puri was the first to advocate on Capitol Hill for Vibrant Gujarat and, as a result of his advocacy, Vibrant Gujarat has been made part of the Congressional Record for historical purposes. Congressional Record statements are made part of US history and may be accessed by present and future generations. The inclusion of Vibrant Gujarat in the Congressional Record is a testament to Modi's vision to take India forward.
As US lawmakers begin the hard work of making up for the State Department's delays, I do commend the Obama Administration for trying to fast-track US-India relations since Modi's triumphant victory. In the first 100 days of the Modi government, President Obama has sent three Cabinet members to India.  He has also announced a new US Ambassador to India.  Although I question the Administration's intentions, it is my sincere hope that the Administration will get to the point.
The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) was wrong to recommend a visa denial and ought to be held accountable for using religion to divide rather than unite nations. USCIRF is not an elected body and does not represent the views of the American people. It is downright time for the United States of America to apologize.
(Eni FH Faleomavaega is a Member of Congress representing the US Territory of American Samoa in the US House of Representatives. He is one of the longest-serving and most senior Members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and is the first Asia Pacific American in US history to serve as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.

Former Kraft CEO expands Lake Forest estate: Former Kraft Foods CEO Roger Deromedi has broadened his estate in Lake Forest, paying $1.75 million Sept. 15 for a three-bedroom, 3,117-square-foot house on a 1.66-acre property just to the east of the 3.4-acre property that houses his 12,488-square-foot mansion.
Now nonexecutive chairman of Pinnacle Foods, Deromedi, 61, was Kraft's chief executive from 2001 until he was pushed out in 2006. He paid $8.2 million in 2004 for his 22-room mansion, which was designed by architect Charles A. Coolidge and constructed in 1911 for commodities trader Henry Rumsey, who went on to be Lake Forest's mayor. Now, Deromedi has expanded his holdings. His new acquisition includes the other half of a ravine that also is on his property.
Deromedi could not be reached for comment.
Orthopedic surgeon pays $4.4 million for Finkl family mansion in River North: Chicago orthopedic surgeon Roger Chams paid $4.4 million last month to buy a 10,300-square-foot mansion in the River North neighborhood from the wife of the late A. Finkl & Sons CEO and fourth-generation steel magnate Charles W. Finkl.
Records show that Sarah L. Finkl paid $3.85 million in 2007 to buy the four-bedroom mansion new from its homebuilder, just a year after she paid $600,000 for a vacant lot to the west. Finkl first listed the mansion for $7.88 million in 2012, then cut her asking price to $7.38 million later in 2012, then to $7.25 million in 2013 before taking it off the market. She relisted it in February for $4.95 million and cut her asking price to $4.75 million in June.
Features include 81/2 baths, six fireplaces, an elevator, au pair suite, large great-room, six-car garage with wash rack and master suite with steam shower, sauna, exercise room and large walk-in closet. Outside, the property includes 4,500 square feet of deck space, a resistance pool, outdoor fireplace and gazebo. The sale included the vacant lot.
Chams did not respond to a request for comment.

We have the ability to connect two engines side by side: EcoMotors COOEcoMotors has the ability to connect two engines side by side: COO Amit Soman
Virat Markandeya        Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 11:22 IST
Amit Soman, COO, EcoMotors Head.
On EcoMotors' Design
The impact of fuel economy in any engine comes from friction, metal-to-metal parts rubbing against each other. If you can reduce friction, you make the most dramatic impact on fuel economy. That's the first dot we start with in our engine. If we have less moving parts, then we will have less friction and better fuel economy. That is the premise of the whole design. If we have less parts then the weight of the engine is much less. As of now, the engine we are running for comparable power, to make sure it is apples-to-apples, is about 35 per cent lighter for the same power output. Along with weight, the size is less. Cost is less. All these are secondary benefits, those are not the goals we went in for but those are substantial amounts. They contribute to the overall economic equation. Connecting the last dot on this, with lesser components and this compactness, we have the ability to connect two engines side by side. You can almost call it power on demand if you will. This inherentness in the design cannot be achieved in a conventional engine. Conventional engine guys are doing it more from the perspective of cylinder deactivation, valve deactivation. But still, in that case, the piston motion continues. In our case, after physically declutching, you are essentially reducing half the friction.
On the need to reinvent the internal combustion engine
Tighter fuel economy standards are coming and what exists are fossil fuel burning options. So what are the options then to bridge these two things? Number one is some methodology of a substantially researched and developed to conventional engines. How do we bridge the gap in substantial improvements in conventionals? Path two is some sort of alternate energy. It could be natural gas, it could be hybrids or it could be electric vehicles (EVs). First let's talk about the conventional engines. Almost every original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in the world has legacy assets. You've got $300 to $400 million plants that have been invested for in the last 12 to 15 years. So the propensity to invest in something new is lesser, or making radical changes is lesser because of the legacy assets. Economic growth in any of those markets has been going through ups and downs. Europe shrunk and the other markets by somewhere between two to nine per cent, let's say. Legacy assets and slow and unpredictable economic growth will prevent conventional engine guys from making any dramatic radical changes- and incremental improvements are not enough. Let's look at the second one (alternate energy). It could be natural gas, ethanol, even hybrids to some extent, the uncertainty there is from the unpredictability of the resources cost as well as any kind of infrastructure. Let's talk about EVs. The unfortunate thing is that what gets talked about in EVs is safety. Because some kind of burning Tesla comes up in a video online. Unfair representation of Tesla, it was probably an incorrect use of the vehicle and it was one in God knows how many vehicles. But safety comes to the forefront, unfortunately. The second thing that rightly comes to the fore is cost, that from a payback perspective, it is still a 10 to 11-year payback. The third, which is also the obvious one is infrastructure density. My point of view is that these three: the safety, cost and infrastructure density are to a large extent the outcome of the commitment made by the EVs, industry or government. Meaning these three can be fixed in a matter of 10 years. I don't think it is out of the ordinary to expect that suddenly a country can have recharging stations. My perspective is point number 4: even if we have these things. I mean how long does it take for you at a gas station to fill up a car? Six minutes, eight minutes?
Are we going to have a 150 kWh battery that charges in six minutes. I personally have reservations against that. So this is the solution that any people have talked about. Just replace the batteries: we'll take your old one out, put a new one in. Maybe I'm relying too much on my manufacturing history. I don't see how you are going to pick up a 900-pound battery and replace it in six minutes and how you are going to keep an inventory of thousands. Will EVs get the density that people talk about? Yes, but we don't see that density up in the next 25 to 30 years. Today, the first adopters who would have bought EVs have already bought EVs. Which is why, Tesla had to do something unique to enter China, for example. So it's nothing against the technology itself, all of them, Tesla, BYD, they've all got the right product. The question is the adoption rate. That's where we come in. We are not burdened by legacy assets, or any other engine start-up like us. We are not restricted by economic growth in a particular market. So we have the ability to come up with a different business model, a different product.
On Peter Hofbauer, EcoMotors' Founder/CTO
Peter Hofbauer is the brains behind this entire series of inventions. The opposed piston opposed cylinder (OPOC), the engine itself, is several key patents and because of some of the properties of the engine, it allows several configurations which are also patents of Peter. Peter has been working on this for six years prior to EcoMotors' being officially founded. The engine that we call today as the turbocharged direct injection (TDI) engine, has basically Peter's name on it. Before joining, when I did some reading on Peter, I found an article that claims him to be the father of the diesel engine in pass car. There are some pretty impactful contributions to the engine world that are entitled to Peter. He has seen engines go from purely mechanical in every application, dirty old ambassador engines, the equivalent of that if you will, he has gone from mechanical old engines to making them electronic, higher pressure fuel systems and emissionising them. It's amazing to sit down with him or just listen to him in our design reviews: (he'll say) oh, this is the crankshaft problem we are having, this is what we did in 1989 on some project on the VW bug. He has got this unbelievable ability to draw connections.
On Future Plans
By the end of this year, we will have a passenger car-sized gasoline engine running as well. By the middle of next year (2015), we will also have a natural gas engine. Our gasoline attempt now is from a perspective of creating interest in the market. So that we find a partner we can go to production with. We are not going to finish development and bring it to market ourselves. We are going to create enough in terms of performance that it feels sexy for someone to invest in it. Then some OEM will say let's do this together and bring it to market. As of right now, it looks like (production from the China plant) will be back end of next year.

Will RBI oblige D-Street with a rate cutMahesh Nayak      Follow @MaheshNayak    Last Updated: September 29, 2014  | 11:11 IST

It would be an appropriate time for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates for accelerating India's growth . All the ingredients are in place with rating agency S&P, after a span of over two years, upgrading India's credit rating outlook to stable from negative, inflation (WPI) at a five-year low of 3.74 per cent in August 2014, and a rupee that is hovering between Rs 60-62 against the dollar. Globally, the fall in crude oil prices also gives the RBI the comfort to consider a rate cut.
Even 83 per cent of fund managers in the seventh Business Today-Morningstar Asset Allocation Survey expect the RBI to reduce interest rates in the near future. But the market doesn't expect the RBI governor to cut rates on Tuesday, September 30, when the central bank reviews its monetary policy. Any positive surprises will be a big trigger to Indian equity market.
In the next six months about half of fund managers surveyed in the BT survey expect the repo rate - the rate at which the RBI borrows from banks - to drop to 7-7.5 per cent from eight per cent currently. The other half expects it to be between 7.5 and eight per cent. In the last survey, the sentiment was much the same, though only 18 per cent expected policy rates would drop to 7-7.5 per cent while 73 per cent expected the repo rate to be between 7.5 and eight per cent.
This hope of interest rates dropping is reflected in 70 per cent of the fund managers surveyed saying they were increasing their exposure to lower-rated debt instruments. The strategy is that when the rates go down, debt funds will make capital gains as a fall in yields will increase bond prices. No fund manager is willing to reduce his exposure to lower-rated paper in the coming year. In the next six months 58 per cent of fund managers say they will increase their holding in government securities while 33 per cent want to increase their exposure to corporate bonds.
Today, the rupee will be the biggest worrying factor for the central bank. Though stable, the rupee is still vulnerable. Similarly, the twin deficits - fiscal deficit and current account deficit - though not alarmingly high, but unless the government finds ways to increase its revenues it would make the RBI's job difficult to cut rates . Second, there are concerns of a hike in US interest rates. Some quarters in the US want an early hike in rates, but majority are against a hike. Fears of a rate hike in the US will keep markets in uncertainty. A rate hike in the US will be bad news for emerging markets. It would lead to an outflow of money from global markets including India to the US. The market has discounted the US increasing rates by July 2015. For India the concerns would be outflow of money from the debt market, which has seen a $19.5 billion of inflow till September 25. Overall so far in 2014, FIIs have invested close to $33.5 billion in Indian equity and debt market.
In a truncated week, the market is expected to remain range-bound with all eyes on the RBI's monetary policy. Stock markets will be closed on Thursday and Friday on account of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti and Dussehra, respectively. India is not a runaway market but it is a market to build a strong portfolio for long-term wealth. Any correction that takes place should be taken as an opportunity to buy stocks. In fact, a correction is healthy for the local market that has seen a sharp rise in the past seven months with the Sensex surging from 20,000 levels to 27,000.
The market will also keep an eye on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit and his meeting with President Barack Obama. Meanwhile on Wednesday, October 1, the market will keep an eye on HSBC Manufacturing PMI for India for September. The expectation is the manufacturing index will fall to 51.67. For August, the HSBC Manufacturing PMI Index was at 52.40. Automobile companies will report their September sales numbers during the week.

Tracy Morgan:  I Can t Believe Walmart Is Blaming MeTracy Morgan is countering Walmart's claim that the comedian and other passengers should have been wearing seat belts when a Walmart truck hit their limousine from behind earlier this summer, killing one passenger and leaving Morgan critically injured.
Here's Morgan's statement, via a tweet from CNBC:
JUST IN: Statement from Tracy Morgan on crash involving Walmart truck.
"I can't believe Walmart is blaming me..." pic.twitter.com/IG8tpavDvS
— CNBC Newsroom (@CNBCnow) September 30, 2014
Walmart said that the passengers' injuries were at least partly caused by their "failure to properly wear an appropriate available seatbelt restraint device," according to the AP. Morgan has sued Walmart over the crash, which killed his friend James McNair, 63.
Kevin Roper, the driver behind the wheel of the Walmart truck involved in the fatal crash, reportedly hadn't slept in 24 hours.
UPDATE [6:26 p.m. ET]:
Walmart released the following statement on Tuesday afternoon:
"Walmart is committed to working to resolve all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident. As part of the ordinary course of legal proceedings, Walmart filed an initial response yesterday to the lawsuit that included facts and defenses that may impact the case moving forward.  While we were required to respond to the lawsuit, we have also taken steps to encourage settlement discussions. Our thoughts continue to go out to everyone involved, and we remain committed to doing what’s right."

Obamacare Sunshine Act sheds light on $3.5B paid to doctors16
For example, Dr. James McGee, a radiation oncologist based in Peoria, received $582,000 in in-kind items or services for research from Merck for a radiation and chemotherapy medical trial, records show. McGee could not immediately be reached for comment.
A top recipient of payments not related to research was Dr. Richard Berger, an orthopedic surgeon based in Chicago. Records show he received nearly $330,000 in licensing payments from Zimmer Holdings, a device manufacturer that specializes in artificial joints. Berger also could not immediately be reached for comment.
Dr. Donald Sanders, an Elmhurst ophthalmologist who was also among the top recipients named, received $175,000 for consulting he did on behalf his contact lens company.
"That's all I do is consultancy," Sanders said. "I have an MD and this is a company that makes medical devices, so I'm required to report it. … It's not like I'm a doctor in practice receiving gobs of money from a company and I'm touting their products."
Dr. Jaishankar Raman, a Chicago heart surgeon, said he was paid $141,259 by the pharmaceutical company Biomet for his development of a new way to heal the chest bone after surgery. Roughly 75 percent of the payments he received were in royalties for the newer plates he developed, he said. 
Dr. Richard Penn, a Chicago doctor and adjunct professor in the University of Illinois at Chicago's bioengineering department, said his payout of $131,413 came from the sale of a successful company he co-founded.
Penn said he co-founded CNS Therapeutics, a company that developed an implantable pump to deliver drugs to the central nervous system to treat neurological disorders. He sold the company in late 2012. The $125,032 in royalties in 2013 came from the release of funds from an escrow.
"That represents the payment to me from selling the company," said Penn, who added that he is a supporter of the Sunshine Act. "There are a lot of doctors who get huge amounts of money from companies for things that might or might not be questionable depending on your stance on this."
Another top recipient, Dr. Brian Cole, a Chicago orthopedic surgeon, received $274,000. Most came from Arthrex for a device he helped develop for use in soft-tissue repair of the shoulder. Cole said he discloses relationships to companies with his patients through his website and does not receive any royalties or fees for the implants he uses on his own patients or when his colleagues use them at the hospitals where he works.
"It eliminates the conflict of choosing a device that we might personally gain from," Cole said. "It assures that we always use the best possible implant for the patient whether it is something we designed or a different implant."
Other top recipients could not be reached.
In releasing the data, officials cautioned that the government has not drawn any conclusions about the disclosed payments, nor should anyone else.
"Financial ties and relationships between medical manufacturers and health care providers do not necessarily signal wrongdoing," Medicare's Agrawal said.
"The open payments program does not identify which financial relationships are beneficial and which could cause conflicts of interest."
Another 190,000 payments were not released because they involved research for investigational drugs or new uses for drugs that had not yet been approved for sale, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency overseeing the release of the data.
Companies were allowed to delay reporting those payments for competitive reasons.
Some of the withheld data are expected to be published next year, while other details could continue to be withheld.
Under the new requirements, all drug- and device-makers that have at least one product covered by the government health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid are required to report all payments or gifts they make to doctors and research hospitals valued at more than $10. That information is released annually.
The data include research grants and general payments for items such as consulting fees, travel reimbursements, speaking fees and other gifts.
Doctors and the drug and device industry warn that the data are of limited value because of incompleteness and a lack of context.
The Chicago-based American Medical Association, the nation's largest and most influential trade group representing doctors, said it remains "very concerned about the accuracy of the data."

The next big thing in the food industry: Flies0
Courtright's path to the bug business began about nine years ago in one of the most remote places on Earth. After 22 years in the military — first as a signals analyst in the United States Air Force, then as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve — he had become an expert at designing and troubleshooting high-tech systems. When not on active duty, Courtright worked as a systems engineer and manager for government contractors, designing and building sophisticated electronics systems for defense, automotive, telecommunications, and oil and gas companies.
In the winter of 2006, four years after leaving the Navy, Courtright was on the North Slope of Alaska consulting for an oil company client. As he watched the towering gas flares light up the night sky, it hit him. “I thought, Shit, this place is going to melt if we continue burning fossil fuels at this rate,” he recalls. “I have to do something about it.”
His first idea: Launch a biodiesel business. He would make fuel out of oil from local restaurants and food-processing plants. But after researching the idea, raising capital, and building a production facility, Courtright pulled the plug in 2008, when availability of the oil proved unreliable.
But Courtright kept turning the idea over in his mind. What else on the planet makes fats and oils for biodiesel? “I looked at enzymes,” he recalls. “Nah, too hard. I'm not a bacteriologist. I looked at algae. That was probably a 20-minute no-go decision. Then it hit me: bugs. They're easy to grow. At least, I thought they were.” But after toying with the notion of using bugs for fuel, Courtright got a better idea: Use the protein and fat in bugs to feed the planet, not power it.
The obvious bug of choice was black soldier flies. These insects live in many temperate climates around the world. As larvae, they are extremely efficient at reducing organic materials like food scraps into protein, oil, and fertilizer. And, unlike some breeds of flies, adult black soldier flies don't bite or spread disease. There was just one, big problem: breeding them on a large scale.
Black soldier flies like to mate on hot, sultry days. Getting them to breed in captivity is difficult, particularly in colder seasons. But Courtright was determined to figure it out. He turned a former seed storage facility in Yellow Springs, Ohio, into a research lab. There, he painstakingly tested the latest academic theories on black soldier fly rearing. “I realized early on that all the documented research in this area was incomplete,” says Courtright. “The universities that were at the forefront of black soldier fly rearing — their research never scaled. You need process engineering, systems analysis, to get this to scale.”
Courtright mostly worked alone. “I'm self-reliant by nature,” he says. “I'm not easily daunted, and I'm comfortable solving big problems by myself.” He repeatedly tweaked the temperature and humidity, as well as the lighting, a key factor if the female black soldier fly is ever to notice her potential mate and make the first move. He even installed a telemetry system to calibrate tiny environmental changes to the habitat, a technique he had picked up during his years of designing sophisticated electronics systems. That way, he could analyze the data and diagnose problems. “I even performed a kind of autopsy to figure out why the things died,” he says. “It was like a one-man CSI for bugs.”
Courtright was alone with the flies on a cold, overcast winter day when it finally happened. As he had done countless times, he adjusted the instruments and watched. Suddenly, the flies started to pair up and fall to the floor. “When they mate, they move in tail to tail,” he explains. “You know it's working if you see them drop. Boop, boop. It looks like little black rain drops.”
Courtright was so excited that he had trouble articulating the big news. When one of his contractors walked by, Courtright gave him the “OK” sign with his left hand and penetrated it with the index finger of his right hand, adding a few pumps for emphasis.
A week later, the whole thing burned up in an electrical fire. “The lights exploded. I killed everything,” he says, shaking his head. “I burnt down the love shack.”
Courtright gets food scraps for little or no cost — and in some cases is even paid to take them. - Bernhard Warner, Inc.com
It was a small setback. Within two weeks, Courtright had rebuilt the mating chambers and was rearing flies again. It was a hard lesson, but it proved he could replicate the crucial mating process. By the end of 2010, he began staffing up, pitching customers, and taking on investors. (So far, the company has raised about $5 million.)
In May, EnviroFlight was awarded a patent for that “love shack.” The design, which has since been modified, had included a multichamber stainless steel unit — with an air pipe running through each chamber. The fly pupae reside on the bottom level. When they become adults, they fly up the air pipe to a caged mating chamber with thousands of frisky adult flies.

Why You Should Never Shake Someone s Handreddit
Winter is fast approaching, which means more sniffling, sneezing and coughing around the office.
A pretty sickening story in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday discussed in gross detail the speed at which germs spread in the office. The crux of it was that it only takes about four hours for a virus to spread to the hands of about half of the people in an office.
There are some obvious things you can do to avoid getting sick at work, like staying away from the communal coffee pot or using paper towels to avoid contact with door handles. But one incredibly easy thing to do this winter would be to ban handshakes in favor of fist-bumps.
According to a recent study, fist-bumps are way cleaner than handshakes and high-fives when it comes to spreading germs. That's because knocking knuckles means far less surface-area contact than squeezing together two sets of palms and fingers.
Banning handshakes is not a totally crazy idea. In fact, the Journal of the American Medical Association proposed banning the handshake in hospitals and doctors' offices and recommended trying a Namaste gesture instead.
If yoga-inspired greetings aren't your thing, you could also try bowing, like people do in Japan. Or touching shoulders, which is common among men in Ethiopia, according to NPR .

Microsoft wind farm breaks ground in KankakeeMicrosoft wind farm breaks ground in Kankakee
Stacey Wescott, Chicago Tribune
Wind farm near Kankakee expected to supply power for 70,000 homes
Officials say wind farm helps make Kankakee County a leader in renewable energy.
A new wind farm that will supply power to Microsoft Corp. for the next 20 years broke ground Wednesday in Kankakee before a crowd of more than 100.
The 175-megawatt Pilot Hill Wind Project is being constructed 60 miles outside Chicago along the border of Kankakee and Iroquois counties. The farm joins a recent trend by corporations looking to supply their power needs with renewable energy.
@matthew.nowaczyk Nuclear still creates waste and if anything went wrong the destruction will last for many years. Just food for thought people and read the fine print!
biscorbit

The wind farm is 96 percent owned by EDF Renewable Energy, a U.S. subsidiary of French utility Electricite de France, and will supply power to the same electric grid that powers Microsoft’s Chicago-area data center. It is expected to begin operating in 2015. The project is expected to supply enough electricity to power 70,000 homes in Illinois.
The project is symbolic for Kankakee, which has been trying to retool its Rust Belt image and its economy since 1999, when it was rated the worst place to live in the U.S. and Canada by Places Rated Almanac. In the aftermath of the announcement, the city became the butt of one of David Letterman’s top 10 lists and the recipient of two gazebos Letterman donated to make the city feel better about its woes.
In 2010, nearly 20 percent of the city was out of work, and the county also faced double-digit unemployment. The county’s Economic Alliance decided to woo the renewable energy sector to the area to create jobs. Today, city unemployment has dropped by half, helped by those efforts.
“We’re not only breaking ground on an exciting, new wind energy facility, we’re leading the way to a clean energy economy,” said U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill.
Kankakee Community College began a renewable energy training program in 2008, helping it earn President Barack Obama’s approval this year as one of the top community colleges in the country for training people for jobs in the solar industry. The college also received a $5 million state grant to build an advanced technology education center.
The project is expected to create about 150 jobs during peak construction and a handful of jobs in long-term operations and maintenance. Tens of millions of dollars will flow to the county through lease payment to landowners and property taxes.
“We are thrilled to see it become a reality,” said Mike Van Mill, president and chief executive of the Economic Alliance of Kankakee County. “In addition to generating job growth and tax revenue, Pilot Hill further establishes Kankakee County as a renewable energy leader and green technology hub. Our doors are wide open for green business.”
The 20-year agreement follows similar investments by corporations looking to offset their energy needs with power sources that don’t release greenhouse gases. In November, the company announced it would buy power from a 110-megawatt wind farm in Texas. South of Chicago, in Vermilion County, IKEA is building a wind farm large enough to ensure that its stores will never have to buy power again.

Pepsi Launches 60-Calorie Soda With Controversial Ingredientreddit
Pepsi is trying to slim down with a new sweetener.
On Wednesday, the soda and snack giant announced Pepsi True, its first mid-calorie soda since the failed launch of Pepsi Next more than two years ago. Sweetened with a blend of sugar and stevia, a plant-derived sugar substitute, Pepsi True contains 60 calories -- 30 percent fewer than regular cola. As sales of low-calorie diet sodas like Diet Pepsi plummet , mid-calorie alternatives blend sugar with other sweeteners.
The move comes a week after the company vowed to cut calories in its beverages by 20 percent. Pepsi and its rival Coca-Cola have faced growing criticism in recent years for the role their products play in fueling the obesity epidemic.
Coke last month rolled out Coca-Cola Life -- also sweetened with sugar and stevia -- after successful tests in the U.K. and South America. Both companies chose green labels for their sodas as a nod to the leaves from which stevia is extracted.
Like Surge, the cult lemon-lime soda rebooted by Coca-Cola earlier this month, Pepsi True will be exclusively sold on Amazon. A listing for a 24-pack of 7.5-ounce cans was not yet available for purchase on Wednesday morning.
A PepsiCo spokeswoman said the soda would go on sale later this month.
As sold on Amazon
Amid declining sales of soda -- especially of diet brands -- beverage companies are getting desperate. They're banking on Stevia as a panacea. Popularized in Japan in the 1970s, Americans began acquiring a taste for the sweetener in 2008 as anti-obesity campaigns gained steam and artificial sweeteners like aspartame fell out of favor over fears of possible links to cancer. Stevia contains virtually no calories .
But stevia has a bitter, sometimes licorice-esque aftertaste that deters some consumers. Earlier this year, Vitaminwater enthusiasts vehemently complained when Coca-Cola swapped out 1 gram of sugar for stevia in its formula. A month after fans flooded Vitaminwater’s Facebook page with angry comments, Coke reversed course and brought back the original flavor.
Original Pepsi drinkers may similarly scrunch up their noses when they taste Pepsi True.
“The fact of the matter is the taste is still not right,” Jonas Feliciano, a senior beverages analyst at the market research firm Euromonitor, said of stevia's taste in an interview with The Huffington Post. “It still doesn’t taste like a full-flavored product. It’s closer, but it’s still not there.”
He said soda companies would be better off launching new brands, sweetened with stevia from the outset, rather than tinkering with existing soft drinks.
“Everyone’s trying to clone an original, and they’re close. But it doesn’t quite cut it with a lot of consumers,” Feliciano said. “So far, especially with cola, stevia doesn’t seem to be the answer.”

In colorful fashion, a judge with the National Labor Relations Board ruled Monday that a major Burger King franchisee in Michigan had committed various forms of union-busting in the face of worker strikes and organizing.
According to the decision , EYM King, which runs 22 Burger King restaurants in and around Detroit, broke labor law by threatening a worker for discussing protests while on the job; giving a disciplinary warning to a union sympathizer; and enforcing a "no solicitation" rule on its own employees.
Most absurdly, the company was found to have illegally sent a pro-union worker home one day for allegedly failing to "put pickles on her sandwiches in perfect squares as she was supposed to do," according to the decision by Arthur J. Amchan, an administrative law judge.
Union-backed fast-food strikes have rolled from city to city over the past two years, revealing a level of worker militancy that many corporations and franchisees would have previously thought unimaginable. EYM King, it appears, couldn't figure out how to address this new threat without stepping afoul of labor laws. The labor board's general counsel, which acts as a kind of prosecutor, filed a complaint against the company in May.
At its store on West 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan, the company employed two part-time workers, Claudette Wilson and Romell Frazier, who'd taken part in fast-food strikes in the past. Wilson and Frazier also worked part-time as paid organizers for D15, a worker group that's part of the Fast Food Forward network, which is funded by the Service Employees International Union.
"Frazier regularly talked about the Union and strikes at work," Amchan wrote.
One day last October, a manager told Frazier that "if he was talking about striking again, he'd soon be picking up his paycheck."
It's against the law to punish a worker for discussing wages, working conditions or unionization with other colleagues -- such talk is considered "protected concerted activity" under the law. Yet the company insisted to the judge that it was "plainly entitled" to forbid workers from discussing such matters during work.
"This assertion is simply incorrect," the judge wrote.
On another occasion last September, Wilson was punished by a manager for coming by the store while off-duty to talk with other workers outside. Wilson had asked a colleague who'd just finished her shift to fill out a questionnaire on wages. The manager told Wilson she was violating the store's "loitering and solicitation policy," then wrote her up for it.
Amchan ruled that the enforcement of this policy on employees violated the National Labor Relations Act. The workplace is a "particularly appropriate place" to distribute materials or discuss organizing rights, seeing as it's "the one place where employees clearly share common interests," he wrote. He added, "This is particularly true in the instant case where some of the workers are lower paid individuals who commute to work via bus."
He also reprimanded the company for its attempt to justify its no-solicitation policy by saying that the restaurant was located in a "high crime" area.
"To give credence to such an explanation would effectively deprive millions of the lowest-paid workers in the United States of the ability to assert their Section 7 rights. As I pointed out numerous times at trial, there is no material difference between security concerns in Detroit and those in every inner-city in this country," Amchan wrote.
It was the day after the solicitation incident that Wilson was reprimanded over her pickle placement. According to the decision, the manager sent Wilson home two hours early for it.
From the ruling:
Wilson admits that she did not put pickles on her sandwiches in perfect squares as she was supposed to, due to her anger over the written warning she received. However, given Respondent's animus towards her protected activity, as evidence by the illegal warning given to her the same day, I find that the General Counsel has made a prima facie that her discipline (being sent home early) was related to Wilson engaging in protected activity in Respondent's parking lot the day prior. Thus, the burden of proof has shifted to Respondent that it would have sent Wilson home early even if she had not engaged in protected activity. Respondent has made no showing that it would have sent Wilson home in the absence of her protected activity. Therefore, I find that it violated the Act in so doing.
In conclusion, Amchan ordered that EYM King cease and desist from infringing on employees' rights to organize, and that it change its solicitation policy so that it complies with the law. He also ordered that the company pay Wilson for any wages she lost over the pickle incident, and that her write-up over the incident be rescinded.
EYM King couldn't be reached for comment. The company has the option to appeal the ruling to the full labor board in Washington.
In an email to The Huffington Post, a spokesperson for Burger King wrote that "Burger King Corporation does not make scheduling, wage or other employment-related decisions for the franchisees," adding that the franchisees "independently own and operate" 100 percent of all Burger King restaurants.
Big fast-food companies like Burger King are usually insulated from labor law violations through their franchising arrangements; instead, the charges tend to fall on franchisees like EYM King. This could change, however, as the NLRB's general counsel recently named McDonald's a "joint employer" alongside one of its franchisees. The fast-food industry is worried that the move could open it up to new liabilities .

Many ComEd customers will be able to power down for cash4
According to the Citizens Utility Board, which pushed for the program along with other consumer advocacy groups, participants will get a $1 credit for every kilowatt-hour of power use they cut.
ComEd will determine the total amount of a customer's credit using a formula based on typical use history during similar "peak" times.
"Peak Time Savings" is ComEd's first pricing program that tries to engage its approximately 425,000 customers that have new digital smart meters. ComEd, which is installing 4 million of the meters across its service territory, is expected to complete that project by 2018.
The meters can relay information in real time about electricity use to consumers. That makes it possible for ComEd to offer programs that reward customers for using electricity when electricity prices are cheapest. Customers who choose not to reduce power won't be penalized, ComEd said.
Here's how the program works: ComEd would notify participants of a "peak time" period by phone, text or email at least 30 minutes before the start of the period. Mostly likely, those alerts would come during hot summer days when electricity demand is high. While it's unlikely that someone working downtown would rush home to turn off an air conditioner because of a text alert, ComEd envisions people moving toward smart devices in their homes that can be controlled from anywhere via smartphone.
Customers with a ComEd bill and a smart meter can sign up for the program, regardless of whether they have another company supplying their electricity.
People who want to participate in the program in summer 2015 can sign up from Oct. 1 to April 2015. Those who sign up after April 2015 will be able to participate no earlier than summer 2016. To sign up, go to comed.com/pts.

Cutting carbon: Cap and trade  the sequel0
In 2003, when then-U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sponsored ill-fated legislation that would have set up a national "cap and trade" market for carbon patterned after the 1990 system that limited sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain, Rowe told the Tribune that he thought the pollutants should be taxed, even if it meant increased costs for consumers.
"I think the climate change problem is real," he said.
By 2008, all three presidential contenders favored some form of cap and trade. A trading arrangement seemed so inevitable that Time magazine hailed Chicago Climate Exchange founder Richard Sandor as a hero of the environment for his foresight in founding an exchange for voluntary carbon trading.
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap and trade system for power plant CO2 emissions, began auctioning emissions permits in 2008.
At the time, the total trading volume for carbon products worldwide was 2.7 billion metric tons valued at $60 billion. A U.S. cap and trade plan, experts said at the time, would triple that market.
By 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a cap and trade plan that would require companies to buy an allowance, or permit, which could be bought and sold for each ton of carbon emitted, priced at $13 to $20 per ton.
But by 2010, cap and trade had collapsed politically. It hit its high-water mark with House passage of the so-called Waxman-Markey bill. But in the wake of a national recession, the proposal couldn't escape its label as a "jobs killer."
Shortly thereafter, the Chicago Climate Exchange quietly ceased. Only those with mandated exchanges like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and California continue to trade in carbon.
But at least one proponent of the concept hasn't given up.
"I think when you take a state like Illinois, with all its attention deficit problems and revenue problems, a modest carbon tax would be a wonderful way to try to comply with the EPA rules," Rowe reiterated last week. He said the taxes generated could be used to fund education or pensions.
It stands to reason that Exelon would favor taxing carbon emissions. Its six nuclear plants in Illinois don't emit carbon, while such a tax would hit competitors whose plants burn coal and natural gas.
Exelon's nuclear plants, along with others, are struggling to compete. A carbon tax or cap and trade plan looks more like a lifeline.
The EPA estimates that 6 percent of the 100 nuclear reactors in the United States are threatened with closing.
The EPA's aggressive goals of 30 percent greenhouse gas reductions from 2005 levels by 2030 give states like Illinois an incentive to keep Exelon's nuclear plants in the state open.
Exelon's Barron told regulators last week that about 43 percent of Exelon's nuclear generation is at risk.
The EPA's so-called carbon rule gives states any number of ways to comply with the proposed law. Illinois can choose to go it alone or team with other states on a regional approach.
That would buy Illinois more time and save the Midwest region an estimated $3 billion annually in compliance costs, according to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which controls the part of the electrical grid that includes most of Illinois.
Exelon said it supports a "regional" approach to cutting carbon, a major contributor to greenhouse gases and climate change, saying it believes it would be cheaper for consumers if states work together within their regional transmission organizations.
Barron said she envisions carbon taxes collected from sources of pollution and credited back to customers. That, she said, would help offset the inevitable expense that would come as coal plants shut down, switch to natural gas or pass along the costs associated with those taxes to consumers.
David Brown, senior vice president of federal government affairs at Exelon, said most of the utility sector would have preferred a national approach to the varied cap-and-tradelike plans that may arise out of the carbon rule.
He said he can imagine a "slim" chance the utility sector will join forces to return to Capitol Hill for legislation that beckons the return of a plan similar to Waxman-Markey.
The question remains — is Illinois ready to return to the days of cap and trade?
Rowe said he expects that states won't be ready to jump on board just yet. Maybe they would, he said, five years from now.
"We can't help ourselves. We're America," he said. "If there's an expensive way to solve the problem, we try that first."

Lakland Guitars LLC
Number of employees: 12
Neighborhood: North Center
Chicago-based Lakland Guitars touts some premier names among its clients, customizing bass guitars for U2's Adam Clayton and Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler, whose signature is engraved on the back of his instrument.
The company previously had outsourced production of its American-made line to about a dozen companies throughout the United States, which then shipped the raw necks, bodies and other parts to Chicago for final production and assembly. They also have a line of bass guitars that are made in Asia and finished in the United States.
8
But four years ago, John Pirruccello and his three brothers became majority owners and slowly began to move production of the American line in-house to have more control over the products and lead times. They have invested about $500,000, including in computer-run machines and training.
The new technology will allow them to make 600 bass guitars in 2015 — double the number of bass guitars they now make and a quantity that would increase their leverage when negotiating prices for raw materials.
In early 2011, the brothers moved the company near the Ravenswood Metra stop, renting 8,500 square feet in a brick building on the 1800 block of Berteau Avenue. The sweet smell of wood fills the factory floor, set up with cubicle-size stations where workers test the Asian-made line or build the American-made products.
On a recent morning, a worker operated a phone booth-size machine that measures distances with a laser and levels the frets so that they are all even. It's important, said Pirruccello, because if the frets aren't level, a string would vibrate and touch one fret before another one, making it buzz.
"It has to be able to vibrate freely," Pirruccello said.

A few feet away, two workers manually worked on frets for the American line. One used sanding blocks to file the frets until they were all even. Another used a hand file to shape the top of each fret until it was round and smooth.
"Each one of these guys take (the bass guitars) from beginning to end," Pirruccello said.
Pirruccello said it's almost three times more expensive to make bass guitars in the U.S. compared with Asia, because of the cost of labor. But he said, demand for the line is increasing, and customers are willing to pay more. The American line retails for $2,500 to $4,000, while the Asian-made line sells for $900 to $1,800.
Lakland was founded in Chicago in 1994 by Dan Lakin and Hugh McFarland. Their combined names became the name of the company, which struggled financially in the 1990s. In 2000, a group of investors, including John and his brothers, bought into the company. The next year, it introduced a lower-priced series called Skyline, which was partially built in Korea and finished in the U.S.
During the recession, Pirruccello said demand for the Skyline series dropped about 20 percent, while sales of the U.S. bass guitar flattened at about 250 pieces a year. Demand has since increased for both. The company sells about 2,000 Skyline bass guitars and about 300 of the American-made line. He could sell more, he added, but he didn't have the capacity until now.
The first product to be made in-house were pickups, a small, rectangular component attached to the body of the guitar that uses magnets and copper wire to capture vibrations from the strings and convert them to an electrical signal that is later amplified.
"This is all (technology) from the 1930s and '40s, but that's what everyone wants," Bo Pirruccello said. People, he added, want the vintage sound. "We are driven by customer preference."
Lakland manufacturers about 20 styles of pickups, which it sells to consumers for replacement in other guitars and to a Japanese guitar-maker.
"It became another profit line," Bo Pirruccello said.
The brothers began investing in more machines. Their biggest purchase came in 2011: A $100,000 milling machine about the size of a pickup truck. The wood-cutting machine can make a neck and a body in less than two hours and can cut multiple pieces at once. It was the final piece of the puzzle needed to expand the business.
Steve Pirruccello, an engineer, was tasked with learning how to operate the machine and the 3-D program that comes with it.
"That looked like something from Mars to me," Steve Pirruccello said as he pointed to the machine's controls. "Now we are pretty good with it."
He attended classes, but he learned the hard way that there are multiple ways to crash the machine, he said. One day, early on in his learning, he keyed in the wrong measurements in a design and drove the spindle straight through the cutting table.
"I think we both wanted to cry," Steve Pirruccello said of himself and his brother John.
Now that the investment is in place, the Pirruccellos said they are committed to being local manufacturers.
"We would like to see our purely made-in-the-U.S. instruments just continue to grow and grow," Steve Pirruccello said.

Chris Mantz wanted a new pair of glasses, but none of the designs in the market appealed to him.
That was in 2009, the year he had been laid off from his engineering job. Inspired by his artist friends, he began sketching his own design.
"The first couple of frames took forever and looked funny," Mantz said.
He eventually found another engineering job but continued making frames in his free time, setting up shop in the laundry room of the apartment building where he lived. His signature design has front frames that are made out of recyclable plastic, with the temples, or the "arms" of the frame, made of reclaimed wood.
"People really liked them, and some friends were buying them," he said.
It became clear he had hit on a market: eco-friendly frames made in the United States. He eventually quit his day job and today, his company, Drift Eyewear, operates out of a 2,000-square-foot studio on the city's Near West Side that overlooks the Pink and Green lines.
But his engineering background did help in overcoming one design problem. The wooden temples of his frames were very fragile, and he couldn't wear a pair for long before breaking them. He experimented with various ideas until he decided to add a thin layer of steel between two layers of wood. The idea also allowed him to combine woods, say a darker one in the inside and a lighter one on the outside.
"The goal is not to create a brand around wood but a look and feel that is unique," Mantz said.
He sometimes uses wood that customers or friends donate from all over the United States, including beer barrels, teak harvested from boat decks and even wood from a picket fence his mother found. He also buys the raw material if needed.
"Mahogany is one of my all-time favorites," he said.

Felicia Middlebrooks on 30 years as co-anchor at WBBM-AM3
Middlebrooks worked her way through Purdue University at a steel mill, with assorted northwest Indiana radio gigs on the side, earning a bachelor’s degree in mass communications. In 1982, she was hired as an intern at CBS-owned WBBM-Ch.2, where she answered phones before becoming a desk assistant. She added freelance reporter duties for WBBM-AM in 1983, and a year later was named morning news co-anchor at the station.
Hiring a 27-year-old African-American woman to co-anchor morning drive on a network-owned news radio station was a bold move,  at least in 1984. It has certainly paid off, with Middlebrooks and her various partners delivering stellar results over three decades. In the most recent Nielsen audience ratings for Chicago, WBBM was the top-ranked station in mornings with an 8.1 share.
The Tribune sat down with Middlebrooks for a question-and-answer session. What follows is an edited transcript.
Q: You wake up every morning at 2:30 a.m. How much sleep do you get? 
A:  I generally operate on very little sleep — on average, maybe four or five hours a night, which is not good, but for me it works. As I’m getting older now I’m realizing that I need to get more sleep.
Q: It took you seven years to work your way through college, and you had worked at four radio stations by the time you were 24. What kept you going? 
A: I just thought if I keep driving at it, I’m going to be a terrific journalist someday. I didn’t know how it was going to happen, but my parents didn’t teach me to give up, otherwise I would have, because it was really difficult.
Q:  Did you see yourself as something of a pioneer when you were installed as morning drive co-anchor at WBBM? 
A:  I got this opportunity of a lifetime and I guess I was an accidental trailblazer. I was the first woman and the first person of color to co-anchor and it was tough, because I was doing it in an era when women were not supposed to be in morning drive.
Q: Did that add to the pressure to succeed?
A: It was a heavy burden for someone of that age. I was 27 and I don’t think I realized the gravity of what had happened to me. It was significant because I could not fail. If I failed, then that would say to my superiors, we gave a woman a chance, we gave a minority a chance, and they couldn’t cut it. So I was not about to let that happen. I had to be successful — I could not fail.
Q: What motivates you to keep working at it?   
A: I love what I do, I work with extraordinarily talented people. I believe iron sharpens iron, and so it makes me better. I just get up every morning with purpose. It’s a very necessary service ... just making sure people are armed with the information they need so they can make informed, intelligent decisions about their lives.
Q: What is the hardest part of doing morning drive radio for 30 years?
A: I think just waking up is the hardest part. That’s the challenge — to get going. Because once you’re there, I get this rush every morning. I come in there ready to roll. There’s a sense of obligation and purpose, and you know there are people waiting on you to help them start their morning.

Murthy helps Mphasis manage liquidity betterStory
On Solid Footing
"We invest only in liquid mutual funds, bank deposits, and short-duration fixed maturity plans, which are not subject to any interest rate volatility," says Murthy.

BT-Yes Bank Best CFOs Survey
Consistent Liquidity Management (Large Companies)
WINNER: Ganesh Murthy, Former CFO and EVP, MphasiS
Ganesh Murthy, 52, had been with Mphasis for five years and has now moved on to Dell Services, but not before he put the company's balancesheet on a solid footing. When Murthy joined Mphasis from HP in 2009, the company had $12 million cash. Today, it has $430 million, after many acquisitions and dividend payouts.
Where does he park the money?
Mphasis, India's sixth-largest IT services company with revenues of Rs 5,796 crore in 2013, has a simple investment policy. The focus is safety, liquidity and returns. "We invest only in liquid mutual funds, bank deposits, and short-duration fixed maturity plans, which are not subject to any interest rate volatility ," says Murthy. Most of its cash - Rs 2,080 crore - is in liquid mutual funds. Only Rs 100 crore are in bank deposits. "Our return is 6.3 per cent net of taxes last year. We have done a benchmarking with other Indian IT service companies - most of them have a return of 6 per cent," Murthy says.
The company does not invest in anything that exceeds 10 per cent of the corpus of the fund. If the fund size is Rs 1,000 crore, for instance, it does not invest more than Rs 100 crore in that fund.
Murthy says the company's treasury policies have not changed much in the last five years. It monitors the receivables closely and has made good progress over the last few quarters. The debtors turnover ratio at 9 in 2012/13 indicates debtors buy and pay nine times a year. The credit goes to the CFO in faster conversion of debtors to cash.
"Our DSO (Day Sales Outstanding) has improved considerably over the last few quarters. In the March quarter, we were at 71 days. The industry average is 76-80 days," Murthy says and adds that DSO was more than 80 days for the company earlier.

Brooklyn Boulders: An active  dusty  gritty workspace comes to ChicagoUPDATE: ONWARD COWORKING | As the center of gravity for Chicago innovation pulls gradually west and north of the Loop, Onward Coworking, at the corner of Morgan Street and Washington Boulevard, is well positioned to accommodate the independent West Loop professionals serving that workforce of... ( James Janega )
It will also feature a 1,000-square-foot “active collaborative workspace,” replete with standing desks, exercise-ball sitting desks and above-desk pull-up bars. Even the treadmills will have desktops. The goal: to meld physicality with productivity. Brooklyn Boulders Chicago will open to the public in December. 
“Climbing is our competency, but we’re now layering entrepreneurship, design, music and culture,” said Jesse Levin, senior cultural chameleon — or community developer — at Brooklyn Boulders.
Gym members will pay a small additional monthly fee to use the active collaborative workspace, which will overlook one of the climbing walls and face the fitness area.
The facility will span two adjacent, connected buildings. The north building is already open to the hundreds who bought memberships through a pre-sale, Levin said. They paid $625 for 12 months, or $195 for three months, said head of marketing Andrew Ching. Pre-sale pricing rates increase every two weeks with standard prices effective Dec. 2.
Levin said a complete space that includes both buildings and occupies former church offices will open to the public in December. After that, a 12-month membership will cost $925 and a monthly membership will run $109. The fee lets members access climbing walls, fitness classes, ACW, showers and other amenities. Later, the facility will introduce youth climbing programs and personal training for an additional fee.
Blank for now, Brooklyn Boulders Chicago’s walls will eventually feature street art, while its open spaces will house events such as birthday parties and corporate retreats, Levin said.
Levin said Brooklyn Boulders raises capital from angel investors for each facility it opens. He declined to say how much the Chicago project cost but said it was a “multi-, multi-, multi-million dollar” project.
The company opened the doors to its first location, in Brooklyn, in 2009 with the goal of giving city dwellers a place to climb.
In 2013, Brooklyn Boulders expanded to Somerville, Mass., just outside Boston. The team had observed unexpected collaborations sprouting in Brooklyn — user experience designers crossing paths with makers, IDEO employees bumping into yogis.

Online Payday Lenders Are Often  Fraudulent   Study FindsEmail
Going online to apply for a payday loan is convenient and confidential – but it’s also risky, according to a report released Thursday by the Pew Charitable Trusts .
This first-ever national survey of payday loan borrowers found that a number of fraudulent, abusive and even illegal practices were often associated with these Internet lenders. The key findings:
32 percent of online customers report having an unauthorized withdrawal from their bank account
46 percent said the lender made a withdrawal that overdrew their checking account – twice the rate of those who borrowed from a payday loan store
30 percent said they were “threatened” in some way by the lender or a debt collector
39 percent discovered that their personal or financial information was sold to another company without their knowledge

Going online to apply for a payday loan is convenient and confidential – but it’s also risky, according to a new report by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
“Our report makes clear that abusive practices in the online payday loan market not only exist but are widespread,” said Nick Bourke, director of Pew’s small-dollar loans project.
Online payday loan companies have advertised aggressively in the last few years and it has paid off. Since 2006, revenue generated from these short-term loans tripled, topping $4 billion last year, the report noted.
As the industry has grown, so have the complaints.
Pew estimates about 90 percent of the payday loan complaints to the Better Business Bureau are for online lenders, even though just 30 percent of payday loans originate online. Most of these complaints deal with billing or collection issues and most are against online lenders that are not licensed in every state where they do business.
Pew points out that many of the problems it uncovered violate the guidelines of the industry’s own trade group, the Online Lenders Alliance (OLA).
“While there are bad actors out there that should be identified and driven out of business, OLA and its members are working to ensure consumers are treated fairly and use the lending products responsibly, including providing assistance, such as a repayment plan, when consumers are unable to repay their loans,” Lisa McGreevy, OLA’s president and CEO, said in a statement.
Ads can mislead
Payday loans are advertised as short-term loans – typically a two-week, flat-fee cash advance. But all too often, that’s not the case.
Pew researchers concluded that many online payday loans are designed to promote “long-term indebtedness” because they automatically renew at the end of the pay period – which results in an additional fee.
Nearly a third of the online borrowers interviewed by Pew said they discovered that the lenders only withdrew the fee and not the principal on the due date. As a result, they could make payments forever and never pay off the loan.
Keep in mind: Online payday loans are not a bargain. The typical fee for borrowing $100 for two weeks is $15 at a storefront and $25 online.
Online payday lending is different
In most cases, online lenders get their customers from lead generators, which are independent companies that place the ads and collect the personal information from the borrower. Lead generators sell completed applications, which often include checking account and Social Security numbers, to potential lenders.  
Even after a lender buys that lead, it can still be available for others to buy.
This exposes the borrower to unauthorized withdrawals and the potential for identity theft.  As the report noted, “This practice of reselling leads creates opportunities for fake debt collectors and others to buy the information and attempt to collect money using aggressive tactics.”
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is drawing up proposed rules to regulate the online payday loan industry. Pew said it would like to see safeguards that protect small-dollar borrowers from unscrupulous lenders, and apply rules that prohibit lending to customers who are unable to repay the loan.
The bottom line
Consumer advocates have long advised against payday loans because of the steep fees and the lump-sum repayment requirement. Pew’s research shows that the average person who takes out one of these two-week loans is actually in debt for five months of the year.
This new report makes it clear that the potential for problems is much greater when the transaction takes place online rather than at a store. And if something does go wrong, it’s often a lot harder to deal with it.
If you have a problem with an online payday lender, file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Senior citizens in Japan rewarded for quitting drivingSenior citizens in Japan rewarded for quitting driving
Osaka, Japan
Japanese shopping mall offers senior citizens discounts of up to 10% for quitting driving.
Police, shopping mall owners in Japan reward senior citizens for giving up drivers licenses.
Thousands of senior citizens are turning in drivers licenses in Japan to get 10% discounts on taxis.
OSAKA, Japan — A shopping street in Osaka has begun providing discounts to elderly drivers who voluntarily turn in their driver's licenses, while a local police station last month held a "graduation ceremony" for seniors who have given up driving.
These moves were aimed at stemming the increasing number of traffic accidents involving elderly people, particularly accidents associated with their declining attentiveness and reflexes.
Everyone wants to reduce their auto insurance premiums, right? Well, in 34 states and the District of Columbia getting older can be the ticket to cheaper car insurance. All you have to do is pass an approved driving class that aims to improve your driving skills. If you do, you can lower your... ( Jen Burklow )
About 40 stores of the Senbayashi shopping street and other places in Asahi Ward began providing discounts this summer to people aged 65 and older who turned in their driver's licenses. At barber shops and restaurants, people can get discounts of 3 percent to 10 percent off goods or services when they present a certificate of their driving history, which is given to them when they return their driver's licenses.
The program was launched by the association of shopping streets in the ward at the Asahi Police Station's suggestion. The association asked its member stores to join the program.
An example of Japanese generosity. The oldsters will also get free instructions on committing seppuku.

"I hope the program will help ensure the safety of elderly people who shop at shopping streets," said Keizo Yasuda, 70, the association's chairman.
Meanwhile, at a ceremony on September 5, the police station presented a "certificate of graduation from driving" to 10 people aged 67-83 who returned their driver's licenses.
At the beginning of the ceremony, Takehiro Komaki, head of the police station, told the participants, "I thank you for your cooperation to improving traffic safety."
Takayuki Hirohata, 76, a self-employed person who was honored at the ward's ceremony, said: "We tend to assume our driving skills haven't declined. But I'll quit driving for my beloved family."
According to the Osaka prefectural police's driver's license department, an increasing number of shops and other businesses have begun providing such services to elderly people who return their driver's licenses.
In Osaka Prefecture, 10,772 elderly people returned their driver's licenses last year, 11 times the number who returned their licenses in 2011, when the police began collecting such data.
In Shizuoka, Japan, the Shizuoka Minami Police Station has opened a counseling office to encourage drivers aged 65 and older to return their driver's license to reduce number of traffic accidents caused by elderly drivers.
The office, the first of its kind in the prefecture, accepts consultations from elderly drivers who are concerned about their own driving and their family members and advises them to return their driver's license.
As of September 10, there were 1,404 accidents this year in the area covered by the police station, down 71 from the same period last year. However, 229 of them were caused by elderly drivers aged 65 and older, an increase of 26. Because of this, the police station decided to open the office.
The office is manned by three traffic patrol officers.
The service began on September 5 and within six days, 11 people aged at 66 to 90 returned their driver's licenses. There were 40 as of Sept. 28, according to the police station.
People will be given a certificate of their driving history when they return their driver's licenses. By showing the certificate, they can receive some benefits, such as a 10 percent discount off taxi fares.

Senior citizens qualify for car insurance discount with safe-driving class0
According to AARP , the 34 states that mandate a discount for safe-driving classes are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming.
Of those 34 states, 23 and the District of Columbia mandate a discount for online versions of state-approved classes. Those states are: Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington.
Once you pass the class, you're issued a certificate that you turn into your insurer to receive the discount. The discount is good for three years, after which you must take a class again to receive the discount. Most of the states that mandate a discount leave the amount to the insurer's discretion. A handful set an amount. If you live in Delaware, Georgia, Minnesota, New York or Wyoming, you must receive a discount of 10 percent or more. If you live in Connecticut, New Jersey or Pennsylvania, you must receive a discount of 5 percent or more. Before taking a class, check with your state's department of motor vehicles and your insurer to be sure it's an approved class.
If you live in a state that doesn't mandate a discount, it's still worthwhile to see what types of discounts your insurer offers — many offer a discount to drivers of any age who take an approved defensive-driving class. Allstate and The Hartford are among the companies that offer discounts for safe-driving classes; some companies offer discounts to retirees for simply retiring and driving less.
"The Hartford recognizes courses taken online or in a classroom, with discounts ranging from 5 to 10 percent, depending on the state and training taken," said Marc Natrillo, The Hartford's director of personal lines product development.

Audi TT Sportback Concept
Audi continues to diversify its holdings of TT stock. After previously showing off-road and shooting brake concept variations (saying nothing of its wholly redesigned source material ), the German luxury brand brought its Sportback Concept to Paris.
The Sportback carries cues of the new TT coupe, some hints of the original TT in details such the rounded corners of the rear window, and some traces of other Audi models as well. Indeed, it is not likely to be confused for a Mercedes. Enormous 21in wheels let the enlarged TT retain some of the visual proportions of the coupe.

Citroën Cactus Airflow 2L Concept
The French automotive industry in general, at the Paris show in particular, strives to cultivate a reputation for curious, sometimes unfathomable, styling. So when Citroën introduced the odd-duck Cactus crossover earlier this year, festooned as it was with so-called “aerobumps” claimed to reduce drag, it raised the novelty bar for whatever might have followed.
Hence, the Cactus Airflow 2L, which uses moveable shutters to cut airflow through the grille and between the spokes of its wheels, along with side deflectors that deploy to steer air around the sides of the car.
The real news from the Airflow is out of sight: its name refers not only to its active aerodynamics, but also its propulsion system, which features hybrid drive tech that harnesses compressed air to recover energy. The result is a car rated at just two litres of fuel consumption per 100km, in a world where three litres/100km is the benchmark for ultimate efficiency. (Photo: Newspress)
Ferrari 458 Speciale A
No proper survey of show cars is complete without representing the Prancing Horse, and this year’s entrant is the Ferrari 458 Speciale A, a topless variation on the maximum-performance 458 Speciale.
Maranello will build only 499 units of this car, ensuring LaFerrari-like exclusivity to go along with the car’s three-second zero to 62mph time.
The retractable hard top roof stows away in just 14 seconds, making it easy to let the sun in while sitting at a traffic light. The show car wears Modena yellow paint that could well substitute for the sun, topped by a blue NART (North American Racing Teams) and Bianco Avus stripe. (Photo: Newspress)
Honda Civic Type R
Honda unleashed the turbocharged 2-litre Civic Type R, which the company promises is faster than any Honda Type R model to precede it – including the vaunted NSX.
“Honda has had four Type R model derivatives – the Civic, Integra, Accord and NSX,” noted Suehiro Hasshi, the project leader. “The engine in this new Honda Civic Type R is unrivalled against all of them in terms of raw power, torque and engine response.”
The Type R show car wears a searing blue paint job that recalls an electric spark inside a natural gas flame. Alas, such a dramatic hue is likely limited to the motor-show floor, and not the dealer’s showroom.
Purists will be thrilled by the Civic Type R’s use of a traditional H-pattern six-speed manual transmission. A +R button on the steering wheel mirrors the “push-to-pass” button used in some racing series, by dialling up sharpened engine, suspension and steering profiles.
The production version of the car is slated to arrive in European dealers in 2015. (Photo: Newspress)
Infiniti Q80 Inspiration Concept
The Nissan luxury subsidiary has again demonstrated its potential to become a serious global premium brand with the unveiling of the Q80 Inspiration concept car: a long, long and sinuous sedan whose rooftop reaches a scant 1,350mm above the ground, while the car stretches five meters from bumper to bumper.
The four portal-style doors open to individual seats which aim to provide equal priority to each occupant, driver or not. The panoramic glass roof keeps the cabin atmosphere light and airy.
The Q80 concept is propelled by a hybrid electric drive system with a total power of 550hp that is claimed to achieve 5.5 litre/100km fuel economy.
Now it falls to Infiniti to prove that it can channel such virtuosity to the showroom. (Photo: Newspress)
Citroën DS Divine Concept
Citroën’s DS premium hatchback continues to cultivate offshoots. A concept car in the traditional, aspirational sense of the term, the Divine is a low-slung four-door hatch wrapped in sensuously creased sheet metal and riding on 20in wheels. It is a shimmering grey Jessica Rabbit of a car.
“This concept car is the very essence of what DS is and what it will be,” stated company chief Yves Bonnefont. “A perfect alliance between sophistication and technology.”
The Divine is propelled by a 270hp, turbocharged, direct-injected 1.6-litre engine rated at 145 g/km of CO2. Expect the Divine to influence the shape of the next-generation DS – which, of course, should not be confused with the “Deésse” . (Photo: Newspress)
Mercedes-AMG GT
“Benz” is notably absent from the Mercedes-AMG GT, a new production sports coupe developed by the German company’s Affalterbach-based performance subsidiary. Perhaps the surname might’ve added unwanted mass, because the lightweight aluminium bullet accelerates to 60mph in a claimed 3.7 seconds (when fitted with the top-line twin-turbo 503hp V8 engine) and achieves 193mph.
The standard GT makes do with 456hp from a lower-spec version of the same 4-litre AMG V8.
"With the new Mercedes-AMG GT, we are venturing out into a challenging sports car segment with its top-class competitive field,” remarked Thomas Weber, Daimler board of management member responsible for R&D. “This is an incentive and motivation for us at the same time to prove to sports car enthusiasts around the world the kind of performance that AMG is capable of.”
Those buyers for whom the GT remains but a dream can get a piece of its technology in a more affordable package: the CLA 45 and GLA 45 AMG cars employ a four-cylinder engine that is basically one bank of the GT’s V8. (Photo: Daniel Roland/AFP-Getty)
Lamborghini Asterion LPI 910-4
After four decades of brutalist angularity in the wake of the Countach, Lamborghini returned to the curves of the Miura and Jalpa with the Asterion, a 910hp, all-wheel drive hybrid-electric luxury cruiser.
One aim of the Asterion’s powertrain is to preserve the sound and character of the Lamborghini V10 engine (seen most recently in the Huracán) without the muting effect of increasingly ubiquitous turbochargers.
The electric assist nets fuel efficiency of 4.1 liters/100km, while the thundering V10, seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and trio of electric motors can also combine to vault the Asterion to a claimed 320kph (199mph) and from a standstill to 100kph in just 3 seconds.
The Asterion’s 910-4 nomenclature refers to the car’s power (610 gasoline-fed horsepower, plus 300 electric ponies) and four drive wheels. Another significant number is 50, which is the number of kilometers the Asterion can travel using just the energy stored in its lithium-ion battery pack. (Photo: Newspress)
Peugeot Quartz Concept
Peugeot has become a force in the crossover market, its reputation partially built on its success in the Dakar Rally. The Quartz concept aims to corral that rough-and-ready image and channel it for street performance, with a muscular body covering a 500hp plug-in hybrid electric powertrain.
As a show car should, the Quartz rolls on exaggeratedly large 23in tires. The sculpted carbon fibre structure is adorned with mineral grey paint forward and matte black aft, highlighted with splashes of red between.
The powertrain’s foundation is a 270hp 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.  Additionally, the front and rear axles each feature their own 85kW electric motor, which can drive the car as far as 50km on a single charge of the 400v battery pack when running in electric-only mode. That could be handy if Peugeot’s future Dakar racers find themselves out of gas between checkpoints. (Photo: Newspress)
Volkswagen XL Sport
The Volkswagen Group’s acquisition of Italy’s Ducati motorcycles in 2012 has produced a literal blend of the companies’ know-how, as VW’s XL Sport concept shows what is possible when the super-efficient XL1 hybrid electric car is re-powered with the beating twin-cylinder heart from a Ducati sportbike.
The XL Sport’s light weight of 1,962lbs and slender frontal area of just 0.44 meters, combined with a 197hp 1199cc V-twin Ducati engine, work together to enable a terminal velocity of 168mph. Along the way, the mongrel machine accelerates to 100kph in just 5.2 seconds, as the driver clicks through the dual-clutch transmission’s seven gears.
VW made no production announcement, but the company has committed to building 250 units of the XL1, so there is solid reason to hope for a short production run of the XL Sport, too. (Photo: Newspress)

Under Pressure  Google Gives Security Guards Same Benefits As Other Workersreddit
A little more than a year after unionized guards protested low wages outside Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., the company is attempting to make its security jobs a bit more secure.
Google said Thursday it is dropping the outside contractor Security Industry Specialists and would rely solely on in-house security personnel by the beginning of next month. The contractor's low wages and scarce working hours had made the plight of its workers a poster-child of income inequality in Silicon Valley.
“Building an in-house security team is something we are excited to do,” a Google spokeswoman said in a statement sent to The Huffington Post on Friday. “A year ago we in-sourced the Google security operations center and we are looking forward to making these valued positions both full- and part-time Google employees.”
Google’s new security team will have access to the same benefits as the rest of its employees , though it remains unclear if they will be offered to both full- and part-time guards. Google did not respond to questions about how much of the team would be full time.
According to USA Today , many janitors, security guards and bus drivers in Silicon Valley are employed by contractors. This practice, which lowers costs for the tech companies, ends up hurting wages, benefits and safety conditions for the workers doing such jobs.
Loren Diers, a spokesman for Security Industry Specialists, did not immediately return a call requesting comment.
The company's deal with Security Industry Specialists had been in the spotlight for some time -- most prominently last year, when security guards picketed outside Google headquarters to protest the disparity between employees at the tech behemoth and the contractors who protect them.
Employees at the Los Angeles-based contractor complained last year of erratic shifts and $16-an-hour wages. Manny Cardenas, a security guard stationed at Google, told NPR at the time that he was rarely scheduled for more than 30 hours per week, netting only $1,400 on a good month.
He received no benefits, unlike the lavish benefits -- free laundry service, for instance -- allotted to the Google employees he protected.
“You feel like you’re different,” he said in an interview on NPR’s Morning Edition. “Even though you’re working in the same place, you’re still an outsider.”

Blame game after 33 killed in Dussehra day stampede in PatnaBlame game after 33 killed in Dussehra day stampede in Patna
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Patna, October 03, 2014
First Published: 20:36 IST(3/10/2014) | Last Updated: 12:27 IST(4/10/2014)
At least 33 people were killed and more than 50 injured on Friday in a stampede, shortly after Dussehra celebrations had ended at Gandhi Maidan in the heart of Patna.

The incident occurred around 7.05pm at Ram Ghulam Chowk in front of the southern exit of the Maidan, as a crowd of over 70,000 was leaving the venue after watching giant effigies of Ravana set ablaze.
Around 26 people were admitted at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) with two of them seriously injured, said Patna district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma.
Eyewitnesses claimed the stampede was triggered by rumours that some people had come in contact with a live wire.
In the ensuing panic, slippers and shoes were seen strewn on a 500-metre-stretch as people tried to flee from the scene. “There was such a rush towards the exit gate that several women and children were run over,” Verma said.
Locals also blamed the absence of any lighting at the venue for the accident. “No preparation was in place to account for the mass exit by thousands of people from a single gate in darkness at the same time,” said a man present at the spot.
Angry spectators raised slogans against the administration for allegedly closing an exit near the western side of the venue for VIP movement. The Maidan has four exits but only two were used on Friday, they claimed.
The state government also announced ex-gratia of Rs. 3 lakh each for the next of kin of the dead. A high level probe has been ordered, said home secretary Amir Subhani. Health secretary Deepak Kumar has been deputed at the PMCH to coordinate medical facilities.
The Centre also announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased and a compensation of Rs. 50,000 for critically injured.
Identity of the deceased is yet to be ascertained.
Rapid action force (RAF) team was rushed to the spot where the stampede took place and the police resorted to a mild lathi charge to disperse protestors and miscreants resorting to arson, said a TV report showing visuals of the late evening development.
A woman injured in the stampede claimed even though the stampede was triggered by rumour of a 'live wire' coming in contact with some people exiting the venue, an earlier police lathi charge to control the stampede ended up worsening the situation.
The scene at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), where the injured had been admitted, was tense as the hospital had run out of medicines.
People had gathered outside the central casualty of the hospital in large number, but were unable to get any information about the dead or the injured.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences and spoke to the Bihar chief minister to enquire about the stampede.
"The stampede in Patna is deeply saddening. I spoke to the Bihar CM about the situation.My condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and prayers with the injured," he tweeted.

My condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and prayers with the injured.
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 3, 2014
Union communication minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was also critical of the lapses on part of the state government and said the government is closely monitoring the situation.
Shameful that so many ppl died in Patna from where i come from on Dusshera day. Raavan Dahan happens every year at historic Gandhi Maidan.
— Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) October 3, 2014
Why adequate steps were not taken? It is indeed very unfortunate. My deepest condolences with the families in this hour of grief.
— Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) October 3, 2014
Government of India is very closely monitoring the situation.
— Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) October 3, 2014
Congress President Sonia Gandhi also expressed "shock and grief" over the deaths and injuries.
"Dismayed at the unfortunate incident, Gandhi expressed the hope that the injured are being adequately attended to and conveyed her condolences to the families of those who passed away," a Congress statement said.
Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan has sought a probe by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) into the administrative lapses, leading to the stampede.
Talking to ANI in New Delhi, he said that the MHA should seriously ponder about conducting an inquiry into today's stampede as well as the one last year during the Chhath festival. He said he would travel down to Patna on Saturday.
BJP leader CP Thakur, who visited the hospital, said: "Prima facie the stampede appears to be due to administrative lapses."
Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, in a tweet, squarely blamed the state government for administrative failure, leading to the stampede.
This is the second such tragedy in Patna in less than two years. During the Chhath festival in  November 2012, 21 people had died in a similar stampede.
The Gandhi Maidan has a capacity to accommodate up to 4.5 - 5 lakh people. It is the same venue where a series of explosions took place during the Lok Sabha campaign event of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that left six dead.

Really IKEA Unveils  Five Minute  FurnitureEmail
If you love IKEA but can’t stand assembling its furniture, listen up.
The Swedish furniture company recently announced that its new living room line — REGISSÖR — will not only require zero tools to assemble, but according to a promotional video, the furniture can be built "in less than five minutes." This comes as big news from a brand notorious for requiring blood, sweat, tears and hours of your life to put together its furniture.
IKEA touts that the time-saving trick is found in its new special wedge dowels that replace the screws, nuts, bolts and other hardware that would typically come with its furniture.
“By making it even easier to assemble our furniture, we want to give people who may find it challenging a new reason for choosing IKEA,” Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA, said in a press release . 
The REGISSÖR line will roll out this month, featuring a bookshelf, cabinets and a coffee table, while the new assembly approach will also be available on the STOCKHOLM sideboard and cabinet. Additional storage units using tool-free assembly are slated for spring 2015.

India should aim at $40 b gold jewellery export by 2020: WGCgold and precious material
India, the world’s largest gold consumer, should target five-fold increase in gold jewellery exports to $40 billion by 2020 from the current level of $8 billion, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).
The country should also put to use about 22,000 tonnes of gold lying idle with households and temples and reduce its dependence on imports in the next five years, it said.
Besides, it should aim creation of five million new jobs across the gold value chain — manufacturing, retailing, assaying and recycling areas, it added.
“Our vision for gold is that it should be put to work for the economy, creating jobs, developing skills, generating exports and revenues — an essential part of the financial, economic and social structure of the country,” WGC said in its Vision 2020 for the country.
In the next five years, India should target to be ‘jeweller to the world’ and gold jewellery exports from here should increase five-fold to $40 billion from the current level of $8 billion, it said in a statement.
WGC said that the country should meet 40 per cent of gold demand from its domestic stocks and the rest 60 per cent through imports and mining.
That apart, India should target 75 per cent of gold sold to be standardised and hallmarked in the next five years. It should also provide higher loan to value ratio for hallmarked jewellery and ensure mandatory hallmarking for pieces above a designated selling price, WGC said.

PF Subscribers to Get Real Time Account Updates: ReportRBI Issues Clarification on Credit Cards
New Delhi: Over four crore subscribers of the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) would be able to access their PF accounts online on real time basis using a dedicated members' web portal from October 16.
The Universal Account Number (UAN) members' portal will help EPFO monitor whether their employers are depositing their PF contributions.
(Also read: How PF portability will work )
The portal is likely to be launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 16, a senior official said, adding that in the first phase, the members' accounts would be accessible and become portable for lifetime. ( Read more )
As the UAN will be a portable account, formal sector workers would not have to apply for transfer of PF accounts on changing jobs.
The official further said EPFO would eventually provide more value added services like paperless settlement of provident fund withdrawal claims like during retirement and fixing of pension after attaining the age of 58 years.
According to him, the retirement fund body is on track to complete the seeding of over four crore UANs issued in the last week of July this year.
As per information from the EPFO website, there are 4.18 crore contributing members who are employed in 4.3 lakh different firms across the country.
At present, EPFO has already captured bank account details in respect of 2.04 crore employees, PAN details of 92.94 lakh employees and Aadhar number in respect of 35.4 lakh workers.
The official said that in order to improve the quality of service under the UAN programme, at least bank account numbers of all the members need to be seeded with portable PF accounts as this would make the PF withdrawal and other claim settlement less time consuming.
The provident fund body recently made it mandatory for firms to provide their employees' bank account numbers with IFSC code of respective bank branches to facilitate allotment of universal PF account number and payment to its subscribers.
As per an office order, the firms would have to furnish the information regarding the core banking account number with IFSC code of the bank branch in respect of existing members by October 15.

On high interest ratesUpdated: October 5, 2014 16:03 IST
On high interest rates
economy, business and finance
One more bi-monthly monetary policy review has come and gone, and the now not-so-new Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan and his team have chosen to sit tight. No change in the benchmark repo rate, no change in the CRR or SLR. This is the fourth consecutive policy review in which the repo rate has been left untouched at 8 per cent. This decision, not to lower interest rates as many sections have been demanding and not to infuse additional liquidity into the system, occurs at a time when growth is sluggish, but consumer price inflation on a point-to-point basis stood at a high 9.5 per cent in August. So the RBI’s decision is seen as reflecting an emphasis on combating inflation, even if that is at the expense of growth.
The repo rate, being the interest rate at which the central bank accommodates the short terms liquidity needs of the banking system, is an important influence on the structure of interest rates in India. High interest rates can adversely affect growth by discouraging industrial and agricultural investment as well as curbing the volume of debt financed household investment and consumption. This explains why interest rate reduction is expected when growth is sluggish. But the problem, the RBI argues, is that inflation is high. And reducing rates can aggravate inflation, which in its view can be worse for growth. Hence the stubborn insistence on holding interest rates steady.
This refusal to use the monetary policy lever to revive growth because of the fear of inflation is expressed in a context of fiscal conservatism. The government is committed to pruning expenditures in order to reduce the fiscal deficit and ensure fiscal consolidation. Since that implies a fiscal stance that does little to raise demand, the macroeconomic policy framework as a whole (or the combination of fiscal and monetary policies) is biased against spurring growth.
Unfortunately, this monetary policy stance is being adopted at a time when interest rates are high by recent historical standards. As the accompanying Chart shows, the repo rate has ruled at between 7 and 8.5 per cent for more than three years now, and the last time it was in this range was for about a year and half starting mid-2006. So what we are seeing here is not just a policy of holding nominal rates steady, but of sticking with a high nominal interest rate regime for a longish period. In fact, taking a longer view, other than for the 2009-10 period when the government was responding to the affects of the global crisis, the benchmark nominal interest rate has been relatively high for much of the last decade.
Interestingly, this has not helped rein in inflation, especially food price inflation, which has also been ruling high for a considerable period. All that the RBI can claim (but cannot prove) is that high interest rates have prevented inflation from being even higher. They have not helped bring down the rate of inflation. The RBI governor made a feeble effort to argue they have by pointing to “the steady decline in inflation excluding food and fuel by a cumulative 111 basis points since January 2014, to a new low.” The governor may find that significant, but those having to spend much of their incomes on food and fuel are bound to disagree. The fact that this failure on the inflation front combined with the pressure to do something for growth has not pushed the RBI to cut rates suggests that there could be factors other than inflation influencing the central bank’s interest rate policy.
One such influence can be the effect interest rates have on inflows of foreign portfolio investment. As noted earlier, the benchmark rate influences the structure of interest rates. And that structure in turn influences returns in financial markets. So a high interest rate regime is one way of encouraging foreign investments inflows and preventing outflows. That relationship seems to be confirmed by the large net inflows of foreign portfolio capital into India during the period of high interest rates. More recently, close to $14 billion has been invested in Indian equity markets since January this year, raising the Sensex by a lucrative 26 per cent. Moreover, a rising share of institutional investor inflows goes now into the debt rather than equity market (Refer “ Bond Rush in Indian Markets ”, Business Line, September 2, 2014). Investors are clearly cashing in on the much higher interest rate in India than elsewhere and the impact that has on overall financial returns.
Reducing interest rates can have a damaging impact on these inflows and it is hard to believe that the RBI has not factored that into its decision on interest rates. If the RBI governor can express worry about the impact that the US taper and the consequent rise in US interest rates can have on investment flows to emerging markets like India, he is bound to be worried about the impact that lower interest rates in India can have on such flows. This then can be an important, even if not the sole, influence on the RBI’s monetary policy stance.
Many governments pursue fiscal consolidation to appease foreign financial interests that abhor deficits. A restrictive monetary policy with high interest rates also seems to be influenced by foreign finance. Clearly then, foreign finance is not good for growth, contrary to what the government seems to believe.

The rise (and likely fall) of the talent economyeconomy (general)
A century ago, natural resources were the most valuable assets. The status quo began to change in 1960
When Roberto Goizueta died in 1997, he was a billionaire. Other billionaires had made their fortunes by founding companies or taking them public. Goizueta made his as the CEO of Coca-Cola.
His timing was impeccable. In 1980, he became the Chief Executive of a company that owned no natural resources and had precious little physical capital. The talent economy had just come of age, and his company was among the most valuable in the world for its iconic brand and the talent that built and maintained it.
A century ago, natural resources were the most valuable assets: Standard Oil needed hydrocarbons, U.S. Steel needed iron ore and coal, the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company needed real estate. The status quo began to change in 1960, with an extraordinary flowering of creative work that required substantial independent judgment and decision-making. The top 50 market cap companies in 1963 included a new breed of corporation, exemplified by IBM. Natural resources played almost no role in IBM’s success, and its intensively creative employees were at the heart of its competitive advantage.
By 2013 more than half the top 50 companies were talent-based, including three of the four biggest: Apple, Microsoft and Google. Through the 1970s, the CEOs of large, publicly traded U.S. companies earned, on average, less than $1 million in total compensation (in current dollars) — not even a tenth of what they earn today.
After 1980, however, it seemingly became essential to motivate people financially to exercise their talent. Skilled leaders saw a major boost in income for two reasons:
High earners kept more money: The top marginal tax rate plummeted from 70 per cent in 1981 to 28 per cent in 1988. Thus, $1 million earners saw the amount they kept after federal taxes increase from $340,000 to $725,000.
They were paid in stock and profits: Stock-based compensation has done wonders for CEO pay, which doubled in the 1980s, quadrupled in the 1990s and has continued to grow in the 21st century.
Ordinary employees have long accepted this rebalancing of income, but today people are increasingly asking whether talent is overcompensated.
Our basic grievance with today’s billionaires is that little of the value they’ve created trickles down to the rest of us. Our current system of rewarding talent actually makes the economy more volatile.
Evidence can be seen in the Forbes 400. Over the past 13 years, the list’s number of hedge fund managers has skyrocketed from four to 31. Hedge fund managers don’t care whether companies in their portfolios do well or badly — they just want stock prices to be volatile. Stock-based compensation motivates executives to focus on managing the expectations of market participants, not on enhancing the performance of the company. So the effect of modern stock-based compensation is to drive volatility, not appreciation.
The income gap between creativity-intensive talent and routine-intensive labour is bad for social cohesion. The move from building value to trading value is bad for economic growth and performance. The increased stock market volatility is bad for retirement accounts and pension funds. So, although it is great that the economy is so richly endowed with talent, that talent is being channelled into unproductive activities and egregious behaviours.
In 1935, the Roosevelt administration passed sweeping pro-labour legislation. From 1935 to 1954, unionisation rates rose from 8.5 per cent to 28.3 per cent of U.S. workers, and real wages for unionised employees rose faster than both non-union wages and general economic growth.
It seems clear that the economy is heading toward another 1935 moment. Unless the key players work together to correct what’s causing the current imbalance, the 99 per cent will vote in a rebalancing that is radically in their favour. To avert that, three things have to happen:
Talent must show self-restraint: Perceived greed will encourage retribution. If top financiers and executives want to avoid that, they need to scale back their financial demands.
Investors must prioritise value creation. Pension and sovereign wealth funds have become the largest owners of capital in the world. The top 50 combined invest $11.5 trillion. They currently engage in three practices that facilitate abuse by talent:
* They supply large amounts of capital for hedge funds. The problem is that hedge funds achieve their returns by encouraging volatility; pensioners want and need steady appreciation.
* Pension and sovereign wealth funds are the world’s leading lenders of stock, and short-selling hedge funds are its leading borrowers. This lending facilitates approximately $2 trillion worth of short selling on a perpetual basis, generating volatility that is great for hedge fund financial engineers but bad for the pensioners whose funds they use.
* They support stock-based compensation. But broad returns on public equities have gone down while volatility has increased as stock-based compensation has increased.
All democratic capitalism is heading in the same direction, so a U.S. effort alone would be ineffective in correcting it. Just 35 funds from 15 countries could put $10 trillion in assets behind this goal. If they stopped funnelling capital to hedge funds, lending stock and supporting stock-based compensation, it would be hard for smaller funds to justify not following suit.
The government should intervene early: Governmental regulation to rein in the excessive appropriation of value by the top 1 per cent is preferable to a radically anti-talent agenda that could seriously compromise America’s entrepreneurial capabilities. The government might consider:
* Regulating the relationship between hedge funds and pension funds: Stock lending by fiduciary institutions should be banned if pension funds don’t voluntarily cease the practice.
* Taxing carried interest as ordinary income: This would promote tax fairness — hedge fund billionaires would no longer pay lower average income tax rates than ordinary labourers — and would reap additional billions for the Treasury.
* Taxing trades: Anything that discourages high-frequency trading strategies is an unalloyed good.
* Revisiting the overall tax structure: The U.S. taxation strategy features a very low personal income tax, a very high corporate income tax and no national value-added tax. No evidence suggests that this tax regime has benefited the U.S. economy, though it has clearly contributed to the dramatic rise in income inequality. Goizueta lived to see talent’s rise to become the key asset in the modern economy. But he died before the positive aspects of this phenomenon began to give way to its dark side. The trend cannot proceed unabated in the United States without provoking a political reaction. Top executives, private equity managers and pension funds can avoid such a reaction by modifying their behaviour to create a better mix of rewards for capital, labour and talent.

Going beyond interest rate changesUpdated: October 5, 2014 22:08 IST
FINANCIAL SCENE
Going beyond interest rate changes
C. R. L. Narasimhan
inflation and deflation
Entirely in line with expectations, the Reserve Bank of India in its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy review did not change the policy repo rate, which remains at 8 per cent.
The main determinant of monetary policy has been to get a handle on inflation. This has been very well articulated by the RBI Governor both through the policy statements and outside. In fact, this time the Governor had amply made it clear that a rate cut was out of the question given the inflation scenario. The RBI has not only explained why a rate cut was not possible this time but has also more than hinted as to why there might not be any change for quite sometime. The ‘pause’ may well extend to the greater part of 2015. The reason, of course, is inflation. While the RBI is fairly confident of reaching its target of 8 per cent retail inflation by January, 2015, it is far less certain about its medium-term target of 6 per cent by January, 2016. The central bank’s views on the glide-path for inflation are the same. However, the risks to attaining the 6-per cent target by January, 2016, remain even though they have lessened compared to August. As to why achieving a 6 per cent inflation target by January, 2016, may be so difficult, the RBI Governor explained that lots of things can happen in the world.
The present softening of commodities prices, especially of oil — now trading below $100 a barrel — might not last indefinitely. Food prices may spike. The impact of the recent monsoons has not been assessed fully.
Incidentally, it is on the basis of the Urjit Patel committee’s recommendations (January, 2014) that the targets for inflation based on the CPI rather than the WPI were first formalised. The bi-monthly policy review format is also based on the same committee. However, till now, the government and the RBI have not formally accepted the committee’s recommendations.
The major implication of the fourth bi-monthly policy review is that the RBI framework puts a higher weight on promoting macroeconomic stability and pursuing real interest rates. On the latter, the financial savings of households could certainly do with inflation —beating real returns. After a long time, bank depositors are poised to get a real return (nominal interest rates adjusted for inflation). In that context, the moves to reduce the deposit rates by leading banks will nullify the impact of falling inflation.
Another clear inference is that the RBI expects the government to tackle the supply side issues relating to food. Food inflation accounts for a significant part of retail and wholesale inflation indices. In the CPI index, food inflation at 9.5 per cent is still high although in the WPI, it has shown improvement. The RBI has to wage a relentless war in keeping down inflation expectations.
Recent policy statements and clarifications by the Governor and senior officials are meant to downplay the overweening focus on rate actions in the policy review. The policy announcements ought to be viewed for the structural changes they propose. This time, there is a further calibrated move to cut the held-to-maturity (HTM) ceiling by banks. This will pave the way for a more orderly development of institutions. By tweaking the norms for calculating the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), banks are allowed greater access to funds for their normal deployment. The announcement to create a central repository for frauds is another welcome step. The decline in credit disbursements by banks — it has dropped to below 10 per cent on year-on-year basis — is a worrisome development. The RBI, however, thinks it is not due to high interest rates. The base effect may be at play. Besides, companies may be mobilising money from outside the banking system. Oil companies have not been fully utilising the limits allotted to them.
The RBI has emphatically stated that future policy changes will be entirely dependent on data. Its projections on medium-term inflation — 6 per cent by January, 2016 — will be the pivot around which other policy changes will devolve.
In sum, the latest monetary policy review carries forward the main tenets of recent statements, namely, inflation, especially retail inflation, remains a worry ruling out a rate cut for quite sometime. It is more difficult to achieve the 8 per cent near-term target by January, 2015 than the 6 per cent medium-term target by January, 2016. All these lead to the conclusion that monetary policy reviews need not be — and as recent ones show — focussed only on rate changes.

Boeing offers Air India $24 mn for Dreamliner woesBoeing offers Air India $24 mn for Dreamliner woes
Tushar Srivastava , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 05, 2014
First Published: 22:46 IST(5/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:29 IST(6/10/2014)
Comments
US aircraft maker Boeing has offered a compensation of $24 million to Air India (AI) for the losses suffered by the airline as a result of the repeated grounding of the B787 Dreamliner. The amount offered by Boeing is approximately half of what India’s national carrier  had asked for.

The Boeing 787 has been a source of constant trouble for AI. Till June, 318 cases of delays had been reported due to technical snags in the Dreamliner.
“Boeing has agreed to a compensation of $24 million, which is approximately half of the compensation asked by Air India,” said the minutes of the meeting of the oversight committee that is overseeing the implementation of AI’s ‘turnaround plan’.
“We do not comment on discussions with our customers,” said a Boeing spokesperson in response to a mail from HT.
AI did not offer comments for the story. Sources said negotiations were on between the two sides on the quantum of compensation to be paid.
An AI official, who did not wish to be named, said the compensation amount of $48 million that the airline was demanding from Boeing had been arrived based on the actual cost incurred on account of servicing the aircraft loan during grounding, retraining of pilots and commercial cost.
Sources said AI has requested the aviation ministry to nominate an official to negotiate with Boeing.

political systems
Many thousands of Kashmiris who live in Scotland could vote in the Scottish referendum, but they have little say in their own State
October 12, 2020: In last week’s referendum, the campaign for Kashmir’s status took a surprising turn when citizens of the State voted overwhelmingly to stay with India. With a 90 per cent turnout in virtually all districts of Jammu and Kashmir, the vote made it abundantly clear that separatist forces, fuelled by neighbouring Pakistan, had been convincingly defeated. Yasin Malik, who had supported the idea of an independent homeland for the Kashmiris, immediately asked for a recount; the vote however clearly stated that the majority of the local population wished to remain with India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had endorsed the referendum is expected to appear on national television to outline constitutional reforms, giving greater autonomy to Kashmir within the Indian union...
Sixty seven years after independence, the Indian state still struggles with such archaic ideas of nationalism; it is hard to imagine that the recent referendum for Scottish independence could ever see a similar call to some sort of partial self-rule in Kashmir.
But the comparison with Scotland is perhaps unfair, for Scotland has been part of a 300-year-old union, and its attempted withdrawal was triggered largely by issues of domestic governance. Kashmir on the other hand poses more complex issues of religious, ethnic and national identity. Without the participation of thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees, obviously no referendum on Kashmir can be fair. Moreover, unlike Scotland, Kashmir’s status as disputed territory multiplies choices, not just for independence, but whether to align with a neighbour, and if so, which neighbour.
Symbols
Separatist movements in other parts of the world have only marginally succeeded in creating autonomy, certainly not complete freedom. In the 1980 and 1995 referendum, Quebec rejected independence and chose to stay with Canada. The Flemish have campaigned long enough for a territory of their own in divided Belgium. Even separatists in Spain have been inspired by the Scottish vote; Royo-Marine, a Catalonian leader, insisting that “nothing can stop the will of people.” Doubtless Kashmiri separatists also watched the Scottish referendum closely.
At the heart of the problem lies the Indian practice of nationalism, often confused with private patriotism. The country’s status as an old civilisation and a young nation contributes to such collective insecurity and anxiety. It becomes essential to parade around all the symbol of togetherness at public functions — the national anthem, the tricolour, the Ashok Chakra, and an endless array of cultural diehard longings that make patriotic statements to others: Republic Day and Independence Day celebrations, the ‘India Day Parade’ in New York, Ram-Leela in London. The country’s touchy patriotism is also singed easily by petty cricketing loyalties. Even if long-settled Indians in England root for the Indian team, the occasional Kashmiri chant for Pakistan is a slur hard to bear. God forbid an Indian athlete accidentally holds the flag upside down, or drapes it like a lungi, or forgets to mouth the words of the anthem. To a nation unsure of its identity, these are grave, unpardonable insults.
For the most part, the rest of the world treats its national symbols with less reverence and with the banter of easy familiarity, not to be taken too seriously. The American national anthem is sometimes played as a pornographic medley on radio; ‘Stars and Stripes’ is available as underwear, socks, and bandannas. The Brazilian flag was recently converted to a football and kicked around.
Referendums on independence and flags as underwear are of course for self-assured nations that value human choice and dignity over a vague and — now in the 21st century — waning patriotism.
Liberties that matter
Who is Indian, what he eats, who he worships, what company he keeps, in which country he lives, all have little relevance in a world that no longer respects borders. Certainly at the time of independence, when the Kashmir problem was framed, nationalism was a natural sentiment, triggered as it was by anti-colonialism. At the time, it was the binding glue necessary for a country discovering its new identity. That time is long past. But as a people, perhaps, we have not progressed beyond the assertion of symbolic identity — not far enough to see that individual and private liberties may matter more. And that people in Kashmir, or the North East, or Tamil Nadu, might have real reasons to ask for certain freedoms — choices they should be allowed, in the very least, to state.
It is ironic that many thousands of Kashmiris who live in Scotland could vote in the Scottish referendum, but have little say in their own State. Obviously, a settled long-term political peace is a necessary condition for any referendum. Under the present cloud of acrimonious rhetoric, a Bilawal Bhutto screaming hoarse about Kashmiri possession, and a State reeling under a natural calamity, the Indian stance needs to be balanced by cautious wisdom. Sadly, whenever ideas of partial autonomy and greater self-rule are raised, the government puts up institutional smokescreens, and claims allegiance to archaic and oft-repeated measures and processes. A nervous nationalism quickly comes to the fore with the persistent refrain about India’s integrity, United Nations resolutions and at what level to talk with Pakistan. When the only solution sought is perpetual stalemate, the problem will never go away.

Would you move abroad for a jobWould you move abroad for a job?
By Jeanne Sahadi   @CNNMoney October 5, 2014: 7:01 PM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Moving to a new city for work is a pretty big deal. Moving to another country for a job is something else entirely.
Yet a new survey found 64% of people worldwide say they would be game to cross borders for their careers.
The Boston Consulting Group and The Network, an online recruiting firm, culled through more than 200,000 responses to their online survey, which sought to gauge who is willing to work abroad and why.
Respondents from less developed economies - such as Pakistan, Jamaica, Honduras and Ghana - were much more willing to uproot themselves than workers in more stable economies. But France and the Netherlands broke that mold: More than 90% of the French and Dutch respondents said they'd be willing to go abroad.
By contrast, less than half of the American, British and German respondents felt the same way. That's also true of the survey takers from Denmark, which is regularly found to be among the best for working parents and quality of life .
Location, of course, makes a difference when choosing a new place to live. Among those who said they were willing to work abroad, non-U.S. citizens said they would most like to work in the United States, while Americans looking to ex-patriate said the United Kingdom would be their top destination.
Survey takers also chose their favorite cities for jobs. Among all respondents, the top 10 cities were London, New York, Paris, Sydney, Madrid, Berlin, Barcelona, Toronto, Singapore and Rome.
Even though the global workforce has become more mobile than ever, not every type of worker is eager to pack her bags.
The BCG survey found that 70% of engineers, particularly those in information technology and telecommunications, were willing to go abroad. Far less willing were those who worked in the fields of health and social work, with only about half saying they'd take a job in another country.

Books of Nehruvian historians should be set afire: SwamyThe Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy
TOPICS
national politics
“Marxist, Muslim and Western historians” were in the line of fire on Sunday at a seminar organised by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-backed Akhil Bharatiya Itihaas Sankalan Yojana (ABISY) to offer tribute to ‘A Forgotten Hindu Emperor, Maharaja Hemchandra Vikramaditya’ with Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy calling for burning of their books.
The complaint of ABISY — the history wing of the RSS — and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad against these historians was that they had ignored many Hindu historical figures by design. ABISY national president Satish Chandra Mittal said Hemchandra Vikramaditya — who had established ‘Hindu raj’ in North India before the second battle of Panipat, 1556 — was a nationalist. Books written by “Nehruvian historians” such as Bipin Chandra and Romila Thapar should be set afire, Dr. Swamy said.
He said Muslims should give up claim to the disputed land/structures at Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mathura so that temples could be constructed there. “This will help create a new milieu in the country.” Referring to the disputes over the Ramjanmabhoomi Temple-Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvyapi Mosque in Varanasi and the Keshav Dev Temple-Shahi Idgah in Mathura, he said temples should be built there. “Even if the government does not do anything, I will; I will go to court.”

TOKYO (AP) — A powerful typhoon that washed three American airmen in Okinawa out to sea, killing at least one, slammed central Japan on Monday, stalling trains and flights and triggering mudslides, before swerving to the Pacific Ocean.
Elsewhere in the Pacific, a separate typhoon whipped the Mariana Islands, including Guam, with high winds and heavy rain.
In Japan, bullet train service was suspended between Tokyo and Osaka because of the heavy rainfall, and more than 600 flights were canceled at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. The trains resumed service later in the day, although with delays.
Typhoon Phanfone came ashore near the city of Hamamatsu shortly after 8 a.m., and traveled northward before turning eastward into the Pacific north of Tokyo.
Authorities advised more than 2 million people to evacuate, according to Kyodo News service.
One of the three U.S. airmen who went missing on Okinawa's northern coast was found dead. The other two were still missing, according to the Air Force and the Japanese coast guard.
The Air Force said the search for the missing airmen had been interrupted by rough seas. Their names were being withheld pending notification of relatives. Okinawa is home to about half of the roughly 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan.
Japanese broadcaster NHK reported one death, with five people missing. NHK footage showed flooded areas of Kanagawa prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, where people were wading in knee-high muddy water, and buildings and parked cars were sitting in big pools of water.
The search for a dozen people still missing after a volcanic eruption in central Japan was suspended Sunday, and did not resume Monday, because of worries about possible landsides. The Sept. 27 eruption killed at least 51 hikers.
In the Marianas, the eye of Typhoon Vongfong skirted Rota, a small island with about 2,500 residents where many buildings are made of concrete.
Power outages and minor flooding were reported Monday morning. But by early afternoon, there were no reports of injuries or major damage anywhere on the islands as the storm moved away from the region. The weather service canceled a flash-flood watch for the islands.
Tanya King, who was in Sinapolo, one of the population centers on Rota, said via Facebook messenger that she was without electricity and it was still very windy hours after the eye passed. She said a friend living near the ocean had broken windows, "but all is well."
The brunt of the storm bypassed Guam, where many residents heeded warnings about high winds and flooding by taking refuge in designated shelters.
As conditions improved, Guam officials shut down the island's storm center, the airport resumed full operations, and government agencies and many businesses began reopening. There was some flooding in low-lying areas, but roads were passable.

Bose SoundLink Color: is this the best Bluetooth speaker money can buyAt Rs 11,138, the Bose SoundLink Color is a steal, one that can suffice all your music needs for years to come.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:40 pm
I have been stared at and argued with for suggesting that large, expensive music systems were slowly dying a sure death. The smartphone is now the music hub of the house, while wireless speakers are its able accomplices. You can get one of these for as low as Rs 1,000, but you can also get one of those that really replace the large five-speaker unit you just gave away to the maid. In the latter category falls the new Bose SoundLink Color. The SoundLink Color is the successor to the compact SoundLink III and SoundLink Mini. But is it a worth successor.
Design: It is hard to describe what the SoundLink Color looks like. It is all speaker in front and comes with a neat row of buttons on top. Towards the rear you have the micro-USB for power and an Auxiliary port in case you don’t want to go wireless. The unit weighs half a kg and will easily fit into your handbag or even the pocket of your jacket or cargos. The review unit was a very young shade of blue that seems to go well with Bose’s new found love for vibrant colours.
Setup: Bose has always excelled in making life simple for its users. Even the more complex AirPlay set ups would be smoothly executed the way this company does stuff. The SoundLink Colour too has a simple press and connect Bluetooth system that lets you start beaming songs to this speaker in under a minute. There are voice commands to let you know which device it is pairing with. also, the unit can recognise up to eight devices and pairs instantly to the last two. Once linked to your phone or tablet, the SoundLink can be used to adjust the volume as well as play/pause on the source device as well.
Performance: Bose has for years perfected the art of making its speakers sound better than what you would expect from their size or shape. It is like saying you do not need tower speakers to fill a room with great sound. The SoundLink Mini was the best example of this, being able to hold the strings of a party firmly in its hands even though the unit could also come within your grip.
The SoundLink Colour is no different. It can be both loud and subtle as needed. When it is loud it can be the soul of a rather large party. It can also bring in the soulful voice of Jagjit Singh when you are not in the mood for anything overboard. It does both without giving you a sense of its size. The music that emanates from this box is unconstrained and free, thanks to the dual-opposing passive radiators paired with a pair of high-efficiency transducers. The sound comes with a sense of space that is otherwise hard to find in small Bluetooth speakers. I played a wide range of genre and was satisfied and at times surprised at its versatility.
Verdict: I don’t need to tell you that the audio quality of this Bose speaker was great too. But what makes the SoundLink Colour different is that it is among the most aggressively priced products from the company. At Rs 11,138, the Bose SoundLink Color is a steal, one that can suffice all your music needs for years to come.

Difficult to understand who is involved in decision-making in Congress nowWritten by Gautam Sandip Mengle , Dipti Singh | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:49 am
At a recent Idea Exchange programme with Loksatta, Sharad Pawar discusses the split from the Congress, Prithviraj Chavan’s chances and Narendra Modi. Excerpts
On Cong-NCP split
The Lok Sabha election results were right before us. I had said this election was not going to be easy and we will need to face it together. I had a meeting with Sonia Gandhi two months ago, and she, too, appeared inclined towards a coalition… Praful Patel and I, and A K Antony and Ahmed Patel from the Congress had two or three meetings. We asked for 144 seats. Of course, this number was not final.
There is always some argument over seat-sharing in a coalition… Since the beginning, we did not get the response we expected. There was no correspondence even as the deadline for filing nominations drew close. When Praful Patel contacted them, Prithviraj Chavan communicated he would meet us the next morning. The NCP presented its proposal in the meeting, but there was no reaction. Chavan left for Karad the next day.
The same night, we got to know that the Congress had declared its first list of candidates. It included two candidates for constituencies claimed by the NCP. That is when we felt the Congress had something in mind… Saturday was the last day for filing nominations. We began our preparations on Thursday. At this point, the BJP’s announcement of the split with Shiv Sena came like a bomb blast… There was a possibility of our party members being enticed with candidature by the BJP or the Sena. We had to declare our decision to contest on our own in a hurry… Sonia Gandhi was inclined, but the coalition broke due to the new leadership.
On Prithviraj Chavan’s chances
Prithviraj Chavan is a good person. It will not be difficult for him to get elected from Karad, which has been represented by Yashwantrao Chavan, Anandrao Chavan and Premalakaki Chavan. He might have lost in 1999, but he will win the Vidhan Sabha election, because it is a different feeling for the people to have a CM from your own town. This will work in his favour.
On Congress old and new
Some friends in the Congress keep advising us to merge with the Congress. We never take this advice seriously, because it will never happen…The leadership of the Gandhi family acts as a source of energy for the Congress. The Congress came to power twice under Sonia Gandhi’s leadership. Even though questions are being raised regarding the leadership of the family, I don’t see the situation changing. Sonia Gandhi had come to my Delhi residence with a proposal for a coalition in 2004, even when relations continued…

Sebi s attachment proceedings cross 1 500-levelSebi's attachment proceedings to recover penalties cross 1,500-mark
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 17:41 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
As Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) tightens the noose on defaulters and market manipulators, the number of attachment proceedings initiated by the capital market regulator against those having defaulted on payment of penalties has crossed the 1,500-mark.
Sebi began initiating attachment proceedings against defaulters, including individuals and companies, nearly one year ago as part of the greater powers granted to it by the government.
Since then, the market watchdog has launched 1,539 attachment proceedings for the recovery of penalties imposed in as many as 449 cases.
These proceedings involve attachment of bank accounts, moveable and non-moveable properties, shares and debentures, among others.
After clearance from the Parliament earlier in August, the government has notified the Securities Laws Amendments Act, which authorises Sebi to pass orders for attachment of properties, arrest and detaining of defaulters in prison and for disgorgement of ill-gotten money, among others.
Before the Act, the market regulator was exercising this power through an ordinance, which was promulgated thrice.
The attachment proceedings have been launched by Sebi to recover collective penalties totalling close to Rs 2,000 crore imposed on various entities in matters related to violations of capital market norms.
In some cases, the attachment orders have been revoked after the concerned entities made the outstanding payments.
Sebi Chairman UK Sinha had said in August that attachment powers have helped it recover about Rs 20 crore till that time.
On October 10, 2013, Sebi had initiated its first recovery proceedings by ordering banks to attach accounts of Pyramid Saimira's former promoter P Saminathan who was penalised for various market norms violations including fraudulent trading activities.
As per a government ordinance, the market regulator has been granted powers to pass orders like search and seizure, attachment of properties, arrest and detention of defaulters.
The ordinance was earlier promulgated by President Pranab Mukherjee on July 18, 2013 after the cabinet gave its approval to amend the Sebi Act, 1992. The ordinance got re-promulgated on September 16 and again on March 29.
Besides bank accounts, Sebi has also in various proceedings ordered depositories, NSDL and CDSL, to attach the demat securities accounts of the erring entities.

RBI Should Raise Rates to Contain Inflation: IMFFDI Dips 16 Per Cent to $2.45 Billion in September
New Delhi: The Reserve Bank may consider raising interest rates to bring down the persistently high inflation on a durable basis, suggested IMF working paper.
"Given elevated and persistent inflation,... the RBI may also need to raise rates to tackle inflation durably, particularly if faced with a persistent and sizable supply- side food price shock putting pressure on broad-based inflation," said the paper titled -- 'Food inflation in India: The role for monetary policy'.
Food and fuel inflation in India have remained high for several years, the paper said adding to durably reduce the current high inflation, the monetary policy stance needs to remain tight for a considerable length of time.
It suggested that the government should pursue structural reforms to push growth to potential levels instead of relying fully on monetary policy to promote growth.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has been pursuing hawkish monetary policy stance to keep inflation under check. It has not reduced rates in four consecutive policies despite pressure from the industry and the Finance Ministry to cut rates to boost growth.
The government is in touch with the RBI to set up a new structure to deal with monetary policy issues, including targeting of inflation, in line with the recommendations of the Urjit Patel committee.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his Budget speech on July 10: "It is also essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy. Government will, in close consultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework".
The committee had suggested that the RBI should target to bring down retail inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016.
"At the current juncture, with food inflation remaining persistently high for five years, monetary policy needs to remain tight to control generalised inflation," the paper said.
The WPI inflation dropped to a 5-year low of 3.74 per cent in August, while the retail inflation stood at 7.8 per cent.
The paper said since inflation is mostly backward looking, monetary policy has to maintain a tight stance for a prolonged period of time.

Can t hear Turn up your in-ear technology unit!0
Wireless streaming has been available for years through devices such as TekConnect by Siemens, Unite Phone Clip+ by ReSound, ComPilot by Phonak and others. In 2012, Beltone used wireless technology to stream sound from an audio source. Smartphones were the next clear battleground.
Others have seen the obvious connection: Starkey devices work with Apple and Android smartphones, as do GN ReSound hearing aids. Beltone had to create an advantage with better noise-reduction and interoperability technology, Cariola said. The result was the Beltone First in 2014 which, depending on options and location, could run buyers between $2,000 and $6,000 a pair, according to Beltone.
No one expects any advantage to last for long.
“I would say it’s definitely a competitive landscape,” said Beltone senior audiologist Steve Hallenbeck. All the more so, he added, because technology has opened up exciting possibilities for almost anyone.
It took years of hard work in R&D labs to make Beltone hearing aids play well with smartphones, Murray said. But now that its hearing aids connect to other devices, he said Beltone — and its competitors — were looking to see what else might be worth connecting.
The beneficiaries will include consumers, whether they expect health sensors in their hearing aids, hearing aids that connect to other smart wearables or just primo ear buds for enjoying their tunes.
“Things will continue to merge,” Murray said. “This is just a leading-edge technology.”

Festival season blues
human interest
‘Tis the season to play dress up, which is easier said than done with a toddler involved
It’s the festival season and we all know what that means. No, not endless calories consumed in the form of evil, ghee-soaked sweets and savouries. Well, ok, that too. But it also is the time of the year when we get to play dress up, pulling out those sleeping-in-the-cupboard wedding saris or showing off new buys as we attend various get-togethers.
The fun, you assume, has just doubled now that you have a little girl. By the time your baby is two or three years old, your shelves are probably groaning under the weight of all the gifts she’s received since her first birthday — all those traditional dresses (you even get mini pre-stitched saris… everyone say ‘awwww!’), all those little baubles and trinkets, just waiting to be worn! You can’t wait to try them all out on her, and the festival season seems like the perfect time. Nothing, after all, is cuter than a munchkin all dressed up in a pavadai or a lehenga with her little belly showing. Add on pretty flowers in the hair, some colourful bangles, bright bindis and some tinkling anklets… what an adorable picture, right?
In your head, maybe. Unfortunately, in real life, when dealing with your toddler and not with the perfectly-mannered mannequin of your daydreams, things unravel rather fast. Some dresses are just flat out rejected — discarded without even a trial — no matter how pretty or how lovingly selected. Others are partially rejected. This is somehow even worse than the first case. Then you never had any hope, not after the “NO!” sounded, and the dress was flung across the room to fall in a sad-looking heap on the floor (which might or might not be subsequently jumped upon). But in this case, she raises your hopes by allowing you to put on the skirt of the pavadai set and even cooing, ‘So preeeetty!’, and then dashes them cruelly to the ground by simply refusing to wear the blouse (if you happen to see a little girl with a preeeetty pavadai and a boyish T-shirt on top, you’ll know why).
Let’s say that by cajoling and negotiating and bribing (“You’ll look like a princess!” “I’ll buy you a lollipop!” “You’ll be a princess with a lollipop!”) you actually get her to wear the dress in question. Then prepare yourself for the monumental task of accessorising (since you’re still clinging stubbornly to that image of your dream). Some kids refuse any and all hair ornaments — shiny clips and cheerful hairbands alike — and don’t even think about getting any flowers on there. Others will pull off the bindis, bangles, necklaces or anklets as quickly as you get them on. By the time you actually reach the function, your backseat will be littered with bangles and one anklet will be lost, and bindis will be found stuck on all available surfaces (including on your handbag and your sari) except for the child’s forehead.
And so you arrive red-faced and sweaty to the get-together, toddler in tow. It doesn’t help that other moms seem to have had considerably more success dressing their kids. But then, you realise, everyone is cooing over your little girl anyway. It doesn’t really matter if there’s only one anklet tinkling as she runs about or that the flowers meant for her hair lie in pieces on the floor. It doesn’t matter that she’s not wearing the matching dupatta for her ghagra-choli or that her bindi is dangling off the end of your pallu. It doesn’t even matter that she wants to take the entire outfit off half-an-hour later. Your munchkin looks adorable any which way. More importantly, she’s having the time of her life showing off her outfit (what remains of it), checking out golu dolls and decorations, tasting new savouries (and spitting them out), and running around with friends. That, after all, is the stuff festivals — and memories — are made of.

Investor wealth surges by over Rs 23 lakh croreInvestor wealth surges by over Rs 23 lakh crore so far in 2014

Stock market investors have become richer by over Rs 23.33 lakh crore so far this year, as 25.49 per cent rally in the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex has helped the total valuation of all the BSE listed firms reach close to Rs 94 lakh crore.
In contrast, investors' wealth had surged by over Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 70,44,431 crore in 2013.
At present, the total market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE listed companies stands at Rs 93,77,672 crore, about Rs 6.22 lakh short of the Rs 100 lakh crore milestone.
The 30-share BSE barometer gained 25.49 per cent from December 31 to October 1 and touched its life-time high of 27,319.85 on September 8.
Positive investor sentiment following the formation of new government at the Centre and strong foreign fund inflows have been driving the domestic equity markets , experts said.
"The undercurrent of the stock market is bullish although stocks are currently in the consolidation phase and buying may resume in the days to come," said an equities expert.
Traders have maintained that the surge in investor wealth is also due to continued rise in listed firms. The total number of listed companies stands at 5,485.
Sensex blue-chip companies whose market valuation is more than Rs 1 lakh crore include TCS, ONGC, RIL, ITC, Infosys, Coal India, HDFC Bank, SBI, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Bharti Airtel, HUL, Wipro, Tata Motors, L&T and NTPC.
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the outsourcing giant, is the most valued domestic company with a market cap of Rs 5,43,684.13 crore.
Domestic markets have seen smart gains this year helped by robust foreign fund inflows.
Since the beginning of 2014, foreign investors have infused a net of Rs 83,438 crore (US $14 billion) in the stock markets, while they have invested a net of Rs 1.18 lakh crore into the debt market (US $19.6 billion).

Global banks join hands to set up one-stop bond shop: WSJComments
A group of 12 global banks are working together to set up a one-stop bond shop for buyers and sellers of corporate bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The initiative, called "Neptune," will not be for executing trades, rather it will link up banks and investors in the market and potentially some of the existing trading platforms they use, the newspaper reported.
The banks, which include BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings and JP Morgan Chase & Co, are set to pay 30,000 pounds($47,934) each for the first phase of consultancy work, the WSJ said.
AXA Investment Managers and Schroders Plc also are involved in the discussions, the report said citing executives at those firms, alongside a dozen or so other money managers.
Bond liquidity has all but dried up for corporate issues after new regulations and capital requirements forced Wall Street banks to slash their inventories of fixed-income products following the financial crisis.
The lack of liquidity also means funds may have trouble selling bonds in the event interest rates rise and the investors who have sunk about $1.2 trillion in net deposits into long-term bond funds since the end of 2004 head for the exits.
Neptune is the latest in a string of attempts to make corporate-bond trading more efficient. Investors have complained about a growing disparity between trading volumes in new and old bonds, the report said.
JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and HSBC did not immediately respond to emails seeking comments on the report.

7 companies with good shot at big profits7 companies with good chances at big profits

USA TODAY
Companies start revealing their third-quarter profit growth in just a few days. But savvy investors already know which stocks have the best chance for big-time profit growth.
There are seven stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 including real-estate firm Host Hotels & Resorts (HST) , energy company Tesoro (TSO) and biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) that Wall Street analysts are expecting to deliver 100% or greater profit growth for the third quarter, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Hopes are high for these companies’ profit growth. If analysts are right, these companies will absolutely blow away the 6.8% profit growth expected from the S&P 500 during the quarter, S&P Capital IQ says.
When it comes to great profit growth expectations, no other company can match up to hotel property management firm Host Hotels. The company has been on the vanguard of the industry’s move to reduce their business of owning hotels and shift more to a business model of managing franchisees and collecting lucrative license fees. The strategy is paying off big-time this quarter with profit growth. Analysts are calling for the company to post adjusted profit of 9 cents a share, up 800% from the same period last year.
Another company expected to report eye-popping earnings growth is Gilead Sciences. The biotech firm with breakthrough treatments for everything from liver disease to hypertension is expected to deliver adjusted quarterly profit of $1.89 a share. If the analysts are right, that would be profit growth of 263%. That might seem to be an impossible hurdle until you realize the company actually delivered even-higher 372% profit growth in the second quarter.
Perhaps more surprisingly is the huge expectation for Tesoro, an energy firm. Despite falling oil prices, analysts are still incredibly optimistic for what the company can deliver in terms of earnings growth for the quarter. Analysts see the company earning an adjusted 44 cents a share during the quarter, up 295% from the same-year-ago period.
But with great expectations comes great responsibility. With expectations for these companies so high already, it makes it that much higher to beat views. And during earnings season, investors are usually most impressed with the companies that manage to do better than expected, even though not much was expected.
Keep in mind, too, that these expectations are disseminated and priced into investors’ valuations of the stocks. High hopes for future profits often create high valuations. All but one of the stocks, Health Care REIT (HCN) are rated “outperform” by the average Wall Street analysts.
But five of the seven stocks already have “dangerously” high prices, according to New Constructs , a stock research firm that compares stocks’ current value with the current value of future cash flows. The two stocks with lukewarm “neutral” ratings are Gilead and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) .
It won’t be long before investors see if these companies can meet — or better yet beat — the sky-high expectations set for them.
Below are the seven stocks in the S&P 500 that are expected to deliver 100% or greater adjusted earnings growth:

Marriott Caught Screwing Guestsreddit
Hotels, beware: Blocking guests' access to Wi-Fi in order to force them to pay for your own costly Internet service is not a very nice thing to do. And, it turns out, it's not legal either.
The Federal Communications Commission announced Friday that it was fining Marriott International $600,000 for unlawfully blocking customers' Wi-Fi access in a conference room at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel in Nashville, which is operated by the company.
According to a statement from the FCC, Marriott workers were using "Wi-Fi blocking technology" called jammers to prevent people at the hotel from using the Internet via their own personal Wi-Fi networks they established with smartphones or mobile Wi-Fi devices. Meanwhile, the hotel was charging $250 to $1,000 per device to connect to its wireless network in its conference facility.
"It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hotspots while also charging customers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel's own Wi-Fi network," said FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc in a statement. "This practice puts customers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether."
How does a hotel block Wi-Fi in the first place? The FCC defines Wi-Fi jammers as "illegal radio frequency transmitters that are designed to block, jam, or otherwise interfere with authorized radio communications." Marriott was using these jammers to block people's personal Wi-Fi hotspots.
Though the FCC is telling Marriott to stop the Wi-Fi blocking, the hotel chain maintains that what it was doing wasn't illegal.
"Like many other institutions and companies in a wide variety of industries, including hospitals and universities, the Gaylord Opryland protected its Wi-Fi network by using FCC-authorized equipment provided by well-known, reputable manufacturers," a Marriott spokesperson said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post. "We believe that the Opryland's actions were lawful."

Hewlett-Packard to Split Into Two Public Companies  Lay off 5 000Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, and eliminate another 5,000 jobs as part of its turnaround plan.
HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year, the details of which still needed to be worked out. (Read: Can Hewlett-Packard Survive the Tablet Trend? )
Each business contributes about half of HP's revenue and profit.
Shares of the 75-year-old company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 4 percent at $36.60 in early trading on Monday.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker as the company struggled in the highly competitive PC market. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with current CEO Meg Whitman. (Also read: HP Faces Uphill Battle With Newly Minted PC Unit )
"Make no mistake, one HP was the right thing to do to begin the turnaround of this company," Whitman said on a conference call. "But now ... this is definitely the right tactic."
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
Many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the PC business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations that sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.
"Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates," Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP, which has a market value of almost $70 billion.
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
Whitman to lead enterprise
Whitman will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations.
Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.
HP's printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. (Read: Hewlett-Packard's Rise, Fall and Future )
Goldman Sachs & Co served as financial adviser to HP, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz served as legal adviser.

Dine-in movie theater coming to Block 3721
"This section of the Loop is a 24-7 market," he said. "It’s been happening for five to seven years, but now it’s, 'Wow, you've got to take a look at the Loop.'"
Though there are downtown movie theaters north of the river and in the South Loop, where the Showplace ICON Theatre at the Roosevelt Collection outdoor shopping mall also features an adults-only dine-in movie experience, the Loop hasn’t had a commercial movie theater since the 1980s, Vance said.
Muvico Entertainment was set to bring a luxury movie house to the Block 37 in time for its opening five years ago but was among several early tenants that pulled out of their agreements due to financial troubles with its developer Joseph Freed and Associates. The property fell into foreclosure a month before its scheduled opening and was sold in auction to Bank of America for $100 million in 2011. CIM Group purchased it in 2012.
Not including the signed tenants who have yet to move in, Block 37's vacancy rate remains at about 63 percent, according to real estate data provider CoStar Group. Even after the new entrants the mall will still has a lot of storefronts to fill, including almost 30,000 square feet on the fourth floor and almost 40,000 square feet on the second floor, according to a leasing brochure.
Existing tenants welcomed the movie theater’s announcement.
"It is going to make a big difference, just like the food court," said Anne-Laure Schellenberg, manager at L'Occitane en Provence, which is on the first floor of the mall. Flanked by several vacant storefronts, Schellenberg said business has been tough because "there is no foot traffic." Shoppers who patronize the stores that face State Street often don't realize that there is a mall inside, she said.
“We're all super excited,” said Astrid Aguilar, receptionist at Ladies and Gentleman Aveda Salon and Spa, which for years was the sole tenant on the third floor. “We will definitely have more traffic."
Despite being in a lonely corner, the salon hasn't suffered, she said. Stylists have a steady clientele that keep them fully booked. Still, she said, "it is always good to be more in demand."
State Street in general has been enjoying high demand, real estate watchers say. The shopping strip's premier ground-floor retail space between Lake and Monroe is fetching rents in excess of $200 per square foot, about 25 percent higher than the rest of the central business district, Adam Cody, vice president of the Retail Group at Chicago-based retail brokerage JLL, wrote in an email. Larger retail spaces that become available backfill quickly, which is “a testament to the corridor’s strength," he said.
"State Street is one of the few trade areas in Chicago metro area where junior anchor apparel retailers have targeted and opened new stores in the past two years, and the select apparel retailers located on State Street have achieved sales (of) $1000-plus per square foot,” Cody wrote. "It's a thriving and dynamic retail destination."
Talks to bring AMC to Block 37 began at least two years ago when Stone Real Estate was still the broker for the mall, Vance said.
Anthony Campagni, managing director at RKF retail brokerage, which currently conducts leasing for Block 37, declined to comment.
The deal comes as Block 37, located on State Street between Randolph and Washington streets, moves forward on several other projects. Last month it announced it had secured the initial permits to build a 34-story, 690-unit apartment tower with a rooftop pool on the northern part of the block. Construction barricades are up and site preparation is underway, though no opening date has been set.
Block 37 is also set to add a new 5,000-square-foot restaurant and bar concept from the Lawless family, which operates The Gage and Acanto (formerly Henri) on Michigan Avenue, to the ground floor at Randolph and Dearborn streets.
Gabby Leyhane, who works as a legal assistant downtown and was sitting on a bench outside of Anthropologie during her lunch break studying a textbook for night school, said the movie theater might give her a reason to stick around after work.
"On Fridays I usually just go home," said Leyhane, 29, who lives in Lincoln Park. "If there's something going on I might stay and do something."
Leyhane said the energy of the mall has always been subdued, which has made it a good place to study and read. If the mall fulfills its long-anticipated promise to become a bustling shopping destination, as its owners and tenants hope, "I may have to find some other spot," she said.

Bitcoin Prices Are Down 73 Percent Since We All Went Crazy Over Itreddit
The value of Bitcoin plummeted nearly 20 percent over the weekend.
The cryptocurrency was trading around $286 -- its lowest price of the year -- on Sunday but rallied back to roughly $325 Monday morning. Prices are down 73 percent from an all-time high of $1,147 hit on December 4, 2013, according to CNBC.
Over the last year and a half, Bitcoin has traded on average at $337, according to Coin Desk , a Bitcoin news organization.
Some Bitcoin supporters argue that the currency is bound to fluctuate wildly in price until its broader adoption but others are nervous about a potential crash. Bitcoin has gained significant traction recently  as merchants like PayPal, Expedia and Overstock have begun accepting the digital currency.
"I think the price is really irrelevant to the technology," David Moskowitz, director of Bitcoin trading firm Coin Republic, told CNBC . "Obviously it hurts investors when the price goes down but most people who are buyers are in it as long term investors and can withstand the short term gyrations."
But this hasn't stopped many in the Bitcoin community from fretting over the currency's recent roller coaster ride.
"As the price is going down, some of us are under immense psychological stress," a Reddit user posted on Sunday, according to the New York Times. "Please share how you cope with it."

Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
New Delhi: Private sector lender ICICI Bank has acquired a 5.15 per cent stake in Hindustan Motors as part of settlement with the cash strapped maker of the iconic Ambassador car.
In a filing to the BSE, Hindustan Motors said ICICI Bank has acquired 1.07 crore shares of the company, totalling to 5.15 per cent stake, on September 29.
"ICICI Bank has received 1,07,43,600 equity shares of Hindustan Motors Ltd in lieu of settlement of Right of Recompense (RoR) payable to the lenders on the exit of HML from the purview of corporate debt restructuring (CDR)," the filing said.
On September 29, the board of Hindustan Motors had allotted securities on a preferential basis to the lenders, banks and financial institutions, in accordance with approval of corporate debt restructuring process.
Earlier this year, the cash-strapped company's management had declared suspension of work at its Uttarpara plant in the West Bengal.
The Uttarpara plant, which manufactures Ambassador car, had been facing severe cash crunch, and orders for manufacturing cars could not be executed. Since then the company has suspended the production of the Ambassador car.

MTS slashes mobile internet rates by about 33%MTS slashes mobile internet rates by about 33%

Triggering a price war in the mobile internet segment, telecom operator MTS India on Monday launched new schemes with a price reduction of about 33% in its high-speed service offerings.
"We have lowered the price barrier for first time data customers with as much as 33% reduction in dongle prices. We have also rolled out a range of monthly data plans to suit the needs of customers across categories," MTS India chief marketing and brand officer Leonid Musatov said in a statement.
The company said its new post-paid customers now need to pay Rs. 999 to get an MBlaze Ultra Wi-Fi dongle which was earlier available for Rs. 1,499.
MTS said its dongle is now priced at almost half of what is offered by competitors. The statement mentioned that services will be offered at broadband speed of up to 9.8 megabit per second.
The company has reduced rates of its MBlaze Ultra Wi-fi dongle loaded with 10 GB mobile broadband to Rs. 1,749 from Rs. 2,299 for new customers.
MTS gives its customer option to carry forward unused mobile broadband capacity to the next month against recharge of a minimum amount.
The company also announced new schemes under its festive offers which charges mobile broadband usage at less price as compared to its previous offerings.
For pre-paid customers, it announced new scheme to offer 5 GB mobile broadband usage for Rs. 499, 7 GB for Rs. 699 and continued its offer of 20 GB for Rs. 999.
Earlier, the company had a scheme under which it offered 4 GB for Rs. 599 and 8 GB for Rs. 798.
For post-paid customers, MTS has reduced monthly price of 10 GB mobile broadband usage capacity to Rs. 550 from Rs. 875 and launched a new scheme which offers 14 GB mobile broadband.
However, the company has halved the benefit under Rs. 999 scheme for post-paid customers. Under the plan, post-paid customers will get only 20 GB usage limit as compared to 40 GB earlier.
"This is a festive offer but will remain in existence for at least a quarter. After which we will again evaluate it," Musatov said.
The move to reduce mobile internet rates by MTS is contrary to the trend of rise in prices by other telecom operators. In June-September period, leading incumbent operators had increased their mobile internet rates.
The trend to raise mobile services rates picked up and became more frequent from 2012 onwards after Supreme Court cancelled 122 telecom licences and as a result, there were few mobile operators left in the market that had valid permits.
MTS was one of the company which lost licence as a consequence of Supreme Court judgement and the company had to buy spectrum and licence afresh to start services.
The company now operates in Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Kolkata, West Bengal and UP (west) where it has rolled out festive offers.

Disney bails out its European theme parkDisney bails out its European theme park

LONDON (CNNMoney)
Paris isn't the happiest place on earth for Disney right now.
For the second time in three years, Walt Disney ( DIS ) has been forced to ride to the rescue of Disneyland Paris -- this time by leading a billion euro ($1.25 billion) refinancing of park operator Euro Disney.
Since opening in 1992, the theme park east of Paris has become Europe's top tourist attraction by visitor numbers.
But the dream has turned into a nightmare for Disney and other investors.
Attendance has been hit by Europe's economic crisis , leaving the company struggling to invest in new attractions while servicing its massive debts.
Related: The 'Disney economy' is back
Visitor numbers are expected to fall to around 14.1 million this year, 800,000 fewer than in 2013.
Hotel occupancy rates are also slumping -- down to 75% from nearly 80% last year. Euro Disney expects to lose between 110 million and 120 million euros this year.

India s Business Confidence Up Sharply After New GovernmentDDA Housing Scheme: Draw to be Held on Tuesday
New Delhi: India Inc has shown uptick in business confidence post the formation of Narendra Modi-led government with key industry surveys showing marked improvement in investor perception during the July-September quarter.
While the survey by industry body Ficci showed business confidence at a 15-quarter high, the CII poll indicated a sharp improvement in business confidence.
The CII Business Confidence Index shot up to 57.4 in the July-September quarter, from 53.7 in the previous quarter.
Ficci's Overall Business Confidence Index moved up to 72.7 in the present survey, highest in 15 quarters. The index value in the previous survey was 69.
"The determination shown by the new government at the centre to provide an impetus to growth along with reviving the 'feel good' factor has sent the business confidence index soaring for the second quarter in a row," CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee said.
"In order to capitalise on the early signs of improving business sentiments, we must ensure that this momentum is maintained going forward," he added.
Mr Banerjee suggested that "management of inflationary expectations through supply-side measures would hold the key for ensuring continued momentum of economic revival".
Ficci said: "The confidence level of the investors is steadily improving. The new government has geared into action and we have seen clearances being given to some big ticket projects. The government has also announced a series of progressive policy and procedural measures that augur well for economic and industrial growth."
It added: "Industry feels that we are on the right track and that government should continue with its efforts to further smoothen the clearance process."
The proportion of respondents citing 'moderately to substantially better' performance vis-a-vis last six months recorded a significant jump at the economy, industry and firm level in the current survey.
The participants were also optimistic about the near term prospects, with 93 per cent of the companies saying that they expect the overall economic situation to be better over the next six months.
The CII poll found 41 per cent of respondents expecting GDP in the current fiscal to expand by 5-5.5 per cent, up from sub-5 per cent growth witnessed in the last two years, while 30 per cent respondents expected GDP to grow in a range of 5.5-6 per cent in FY15.
A slow pick up in global demand, high inflation and rising borrowing costs are cited to be the top three concerns of the respondents covered in the CII poll.
Ficci also asked respondents to identify focus areas for manufacturing in view of PM Modi's 'Make in India' vision. The sectors identified were engineering; steel & iron; medical equipment & pharmaceuticals; automobiles & auto components; textiles; food processing & agro-based industries; and defence equipment.

Are consumers just shrugging off the JPMorgan and Home Depot breachesCustomers shop at a Home Depot in New York. (Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg)
Updated at 6:31 p.m.
Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase have revealed in recent weeks that each was hit by one of the largest security breaches the retail and banking industries have ever seen.
But Wall Street — and consumers — appear ready to shrug it off.
The home improvement retailer’s stock is up more than 14 percent this year and more than 2 percent since it confirmed a six-month breach of its payment system that affected some 53 million credit and debit cards. Home Depot says it expects its sales growth this year to be unaffected by the massive cyber intrusion.
And after JPMorgan said last Thursday that cybercriminals had obtained customer names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses for 76 million households, the company’s stock price has hardly budged.
The companies may be benefiting from what experts say is a potentially dangerous shift among consumers: data breach fatigue.
Shoppers, they say, have become numb to reports that their credit cards and other personal information have been compromised as incidents have piled up in the last year. Target suffered a major breach during last year’s holiday shopping frenzy. Restaurants P.F. Chang’s and Jimmy John’s have acknowledged hacks this year. So have Neiman Marcus , Michaels and Sally Beauty Supply . SuperValu says it was hacked twice this year.
There have been 579 data breaches this year , a 27.5 percent increase over the same period last year, and it is only expected to become more common as consumers become more dependent on Internet-connected devices, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center.
Recent research suggests that many consumers have become complacent about these intrusions: Some 32 percent of consumers said they “ignored the notifications and did nothing” when they were alerted to a possible data breach involving their personal information, according to a study by the Ponemon Institute, which studies information security. In the same study, 71 percent of respondents said they did not stop doing business with the company that had been breached.
Their explanations help explain why some consumers may be reaching breach fatigue: In many cases, those surveyed said they believed data breaches are “unavoidable” and affect most companies. Still more said it was too hard to find similar products from another company.
“I think we get upset. I think we get angry. And then we go back to what’s easy, convenient and we’re used to,” said Steven Weisman, a senior lecturer at Bentley University and author of “Identify Theft Alert.”
Joshua Cyr, a Web developer from Portsmouth, N.H., was notified last month that his credit card had been compromised during the Home Depot intrusion. He was annoyed by the hassle of having to get a new card, but he said it won’t change his shopping habits much.
“I can use Home Depot again because they’re probably going to be more secure after the fact,” Cyr said. “But there’s also not a lot of options,” he added, for buying similar goods.
Experts say some of the nonchalance about breaches may be because consumers largely haven’t been on the hook for  fraudulent charges in these incidents.  Under federal law , consumers are not liable for unauthorized purchases made with a stolen credit card number.  They could be liable in some cases for fraudulent debit card purchases, but many banks cover those anyway.
And some breached retailers, including Home Depot and Target, have offered free credit monitoring services to customers who may have been affected by the breaches.
“I don’t think consumers really take it out on retailers like they had two or three years ago,” said Terry Redding, vice president of marketing at CFI Group, a firm that provides customer feedback to the retail industry.
JPMorgan’s breach, meanwhile, may not be spurring strong consumer backlash because it doesn’t involve especially sensitive personal information.  Details such as a customer’s address and telephone number are readily available from other sources.
Still, experts say consumers ignore notifications of possible breaches at their own peril, as cybercriminals will likely continue to find holes in retailers’ security systems. And while a breach that affects only credit card numbers can be fixed relatively easily by obtaining a new card, a future theft could include bank account information or other sensitive data that enables full-scale identity theft, which is much harder to thwart.
Home Depot may also be getting the benefit of the doubt thanks to its strong financial bottom line. The company recently delivered an especially solid second quarter, a marker of reassurance of the company’s broader health at a time when many retailers saw meager sales growth. By contrast, Target was already struggling with lackluster sales when its systems were compromised.
Home Depot said that in the wake of the breach its September sales remained in line with its previous expectations. The company also said it expects 4.8 percent sales growth for fiscal 2014, unchanged from its forecast before the discovery of the breach.
The attacks at both Home Depot and Target took place during each company’s most crucial seasons. For Home Depot, that’s spring, when warm weather typically heralds a pick-up in construction activity and home improvement projects. The Target breach took place and was disclosed just before Christmas, the busiest shopping period of the year. Still, Laura Kennedy, senior analyst at consultancy Kantar Retail, said Home Depot may have benefited from the breach being discovered and disclosed in September, a period when shopping is not top-of-mind for consumers.
Some analysts said that customers may also have appreciated Home Depot’s relative swiftness in communicating with them about its breach. While Target took about a week to notify customers of its cyberattack, Home Depot announced that it was investigating a possible intrusion before the company had even confirmed it occurred. (However, Home Depot’s statement came after information security blogger Brian Krebs had written a story about a possible breach.)
“While the PR side of things was very much typical Home Depot: straightforward, up-front,”  Kennedy said, “there’s the bigger question of why it took four to five months to discover that it was happening.”
Target’s breach undoubtedly created drag for the retail titan : Its sales stumbled immediately after the hack, and the company said it has cost them $146 million to date. But in August, chief financial officer John Mulligan said that the “vast majority” of Target shoppers who came to the store before the breach have since returned, a sign that the company is regaining consumers’ trust.
The next clear snapshot of just how much Home Depot has been affected by the breach should come in November, when the company is slated to report its third quarter earnings.
“[The breach] hurts; you don’t want it to happen,” said Efraim Levy, an analyst with S&P Capital IQ. “But I think they can bounce back.”

Hewlett-Packard to lay off 5 000 in split1
“There's still lots of opportunities in other adjacencies, where we don't chase the market leaders,” said Whitman, who will be CEO of HP Enterprise, the business that will sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.
Whitman said HP's balance sheet had improved markedly over the past few years, allowing the company to come to the decision to split up from a position of strength.
“This would not have been possible three years ago,” she said, referring to a proposal to spin off PCs in 2011.
Some analysts expressed skepticism about the latest move.
Barclays analysts noted that the sudden announcement in 2011 was disruptive to HP's sales, its sales force and demand.
“If the (latest) decision by HP isn't well communicated or is not well executed, the negative share shifts could be material,” they said in a note.
Analysts at Bernstein Research also warned of “material negative synergies” and one-time costs associated with the spinoff, largely in purchasing but also in distribution. The separation, they said, was fueled by weakness, not strength.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with Whitman.
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
While there were skeptics, many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of HP or a sale of the PC business so that HP could focus on the more profitable side of its operations.
“Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,” Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP.
HP is the latest in a line of companies to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
“We like the spin and believe it could create additional value over time,” UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, wrote. “In our view, focus is more important than synergies, and it is hard to be good at both consumer and enterprise computing.”
HP's printing and PC business will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co served as financial adviser to HP. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz was legal adviser.

These women CEOs say the key to success is realizing that failure is not a fatal condition.

These groundbreaking women CEOs say the key to success for any non-traditional founder is realizing that failure is not a fatal condition.
Entrepreneurs need to keep simple their first presentations to investors, a business professor told a standing-room-only gathering of women business leaders in Chicago on Tuesday. ( Cheryl V. Jackson )
“We are going to transform urban transportation,”  Robin Chase  told Inc. in 2001, shortly after co-founding Zipcar, the car-sharing company that disrupted the auto rental business. Since then, Inc. has tracked the growth of a class of entrepreneurs who aren't white men as they spawned entire industries and busted glass ceilings. These five leaders joined us to discuss the unique and continuing hurdles facing  women founders , and to share their passion for the opportunities that await those willing to discard the concept of failure.
In a conversation with  Kris Frieswick .
I'm thrilled to be surrounded by so many people who invented entire industries. Kay, you came up with the model for original content on cable. How did you do that?
Kay Koplovitz: I worked in the satellite business. I worked in the cable business. I wrote a master's thesis on satellite technology in the late '60s, but we had to wait seven years to get approval to use satellites in our industry. I was a television producer during college. I put together the skills that I needed, but more important even than that, I worked to be introduced to and know, on a working basis, the key players in those industries. It was really important to know the people whom you had to know before you needed to do business with them.
8
Jennifer Hyman: I agree, especially in my industry, where we've had to persuade designers to sell us inventory, and have it be rented at the exact same time that it's sold at department stores. That's all based on relationships. There is no data that I was able to give them beforehand to say, “I'm not going to ruin your company.” They had to trust me. They had to like me. The almost 300 designers we've brought on — every single one has been about lunches and dinners and drinks and relationships.
What was your pitch? What the heck did you say?
Hyman: That we were going to introduce the next generation of women to designer brands. I'd come from the travel industry, and I had seen that when a couple honeymoons at a specific hotel brand, loyalty explodes. People will tend to go back to that hotel every single year. So I thought, “What are the other moments in someone's life when you can create brand affinity?” The original pitch was, if we can get someone into Carolina Herrera at her bridal shower, she will take photographs, and those photographs will be up on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook. She will remember it forever, and many of those customers will end up converting.
Robin Chase: It reminds me of what I would say to the car manufacturers. I'd say to them that 40 percent of people sell or avoid buying a car upon becoming a Zipcar member, and then when they leave the service, 40 percent go on to buy a car. And which kind of car do they decide to buy? Well, clearly, ones that they've been driving with us, because they're always clean, well maintained, and never break down, because we're dealing with that. People are thinking, “These are fabulous cars.”
Lexy, you started out as an artist. Why go from that to running a retail company?
0
Lexy Funk: It was the conflict of wanting to do art and wanting to be creative but having a very difficult time making a living. That was really the spirit that we put into Brooklyn Industries — which is, how can we form a design company that is also a corporation that is also a retailer that is also a place where we make things and sell things? But that can maintain an artistic spirit?
It sounds like you jumped from the frying pan into the fire when you went from art to entrepreneurship.
Funk: Somebody asked me when I was 8 what I wanted to do. I said I wanted to be an entrepreneur. It just sounded like a very nice long word. It sounded better than ballerina, which I wasn't very good at.
Hyman: I can't believe you knew that word when you were 8.
Funk: What I liked about being an entrepreneur is it's a lot of risk-taking, which I think is cool. I like the math aspect, and I like the people. I like the idea that you can build something that's alternative, that you can create your own culture, and that you don't have to be part of the system.
We have a lot of risk-takers in this group, but we keep hearing about how women are afraid of risk. What has been your experience?
Koplovitz: I want to push back a little bit about this idea that women don't want to take risks or women are afraid. Women aren't afraid. Women need to have an ecosystem that supports them. We've had women who are eight months pregnant come up and pitch at our [Springboard Enterprises] events. Women are excellent at taking the right risks, and when you look at how women entrepreneurs manage their capital, they are much more capital efficient. They make better choices. Maybe they don't make them as fast as some investors want to see them make them, but the track record is better in the long run, and the liquidity events are higher. We should start talking about this, rather than saying, “Oh, women are afraid.” Women aren't afraid. They just need to have a pathway and understand what the challenges are.
Hyman: I personally hate the conversation that makes it feel like starting a business is this big scary thing. What is the risk of wasting your life doing something that you hate every single day? Failure is just part of the process, and we have to start teaching people that if they have a great idea and they go after it and it doesn't work, they just try something else. Get up and start over again.
Koplovitz: That is a big difference from 15 years ago. When we started Springboard back in Silicon Valley in 2000, that's something that we did have to teach women — that starting and trying is better than not starting at all. And now, I think that more women are beginning to understand that.
Hyman: The one thing that's really important, though, is, what will companies do to support women through life stages?
Caterina Fake: One thing I learned recently is that the better a company is in supporting women, the better it becomes in supporting men. My startup [Findery] is only 12 people, and we have our first person going out on maternity leave and a vice president's wife is also pregnant. We decided that it was really important for us to extend paternity benefits to men. It's very tough to do when you're a startup. You have very limited capital, you have very limited funds, but creating those kinds of things is important. It trickles down to benefiting the entire organization.
Chase: The real glass ceiling is at home. Until men are as completely confident and capable of taking care of children or aging parents as women are, that's what we need in order to have equality of numbers. And until that happens, we will continue to have women who, when forced to make a choice, will stay with family.
Hyman: I see these young women graduate from college, and they come to Rent the Runway, and they feel like they can have it all. Sometimes, I feel like the debate that's happening at the level of a Sheryl Sandberg or an Anne-Marie Slaughter is destroying the confidence of the younger generation. I don't necessarily feel like gender has been an impediment to me, or to women who are entrepreneurs of my age group who have had great ideas.

SunEdison develops new technology
To impact solar power cost in a major way
TOPICS
solar
SunEdison, a well-known name in solar technology space, has claimed that it has developed an advanced polysilicon technology. Consequently, it is on target to produce solar material at the lowest cost, says a company release.
“This represents a step-change in technology, and will enable SunEdison to deliver a 400 watt peak solar panel at a cost of $0.40 per watt peak by 2016,” the release adds.
“Solar energy is at a transformational moment in time, and innovative technology is what will power that transformation,” the release quotes Ahmad Chatila, Chief Executive Officer of SunEdison, saying. “Our latest advance in technology will enable solar power to become the lowest cost energy solution – not just an alternative to other renewable sources, but the cost-winner over fossil fuels as well,” it quotes him as further saying.
The technology, called “high pressure fluidized bed reactor (HP-FBR)”, the company claims, produces high purity polysilicon 10 times more efficiently, and with 90 per cent less energy used than non FBR technologies.
The HP-FBR technology, it is pointed out, requires less land, less capital and fewer natural resources.
HP-FBR technology is now in production at Ulsan in Korea. It is a joint venture facility of SunEdison, SunEdison Semiconductor, and Samsung Fine Chemicals (SFC).
The capacity of the Korean plant was originally designed for 10,000 tonnes per year but has been enhanced to 13,500 tonnes.
The plant is expected to operate at full capacity by the first quarter of 2015.

It was a night of horror in Arnia village of RS Pura sector in Jammu district, situated 5km from the international border, when Pakistani troops resorted to high calibre mortar shelling on the civilian areas, leaving five dead and 29 injured.
Pakistani Rangers resorted to firing and shelling of mortars on 10 border outposts and civilian areas along the border in Arnia belt from 10pm on Sunday night.

 Five civilians were killed and at least 29 wounded, the heaviest toll since India called off a round of peace talks in September.
The wounded were shifted to a district hospital at Jammu while relatives said they had become easy targets for Pakistani mortars.
“When firing started we thought it would be another routine thing. But, when heavy mortar shells started pounding our homes and heard cries, it was our worst nightmare,” said Soma Devi, a relative of the family that lost four members to the firing.
 

Clarification on tax treatment over bonds under Basel-III soughtBankers have sought clarity from the Finance Ministry regarding taxation of additional tier-I bonds through which they are expected to raise capital to meet Basel-III norms.
Clarity on taxation would help investors in putting money into such instrument without hesitation.
Banks have requested the Ministry to clarify tax treatment issues with regard to additional tier-I bonds in a meeting held recently, sources said.
Sources said bankers in the meeting said that investors want to know whether these instruments would be treated as bonds or equity for taxation purposes.
Under the Basel-III norms, additional tier-I bonds come with loss absorbency features meaning that in case of stress, banks can write off such investments or convert them into common equity if approved by the RBI.
This would help banks to conserve capital at the time of stress or loss.
Additional Tier-I bonds, which qualify as core capital or equity capital, is one of the means of raising capital by the public sector banks which would require Rs.2.40 lakh crore by March 2019.
Besides, investors also want clarity if they have option to exit such an investment after a few years.
Only few banks, including Bank of India, have raised funds through these bonds.
Some of the regulators have also raised issues on the taxation structure of these bonds.
However, PFRDA recently permitted pension fund managers to invest in Basel-III compliant Tier-I bonds of banks. Tier-I bonds are instruments which are perpetual in nature and therefore are akin to shares.

Middle-class gave more to charity than wealthy in recession4
While wealthy Americans gave a smaller portion of their income, their combined charitable contributions hit $77.5 billion in 2012, an increase of $4.6 billion compared with six years prior, the report said.
The Chronicle reviewed information from taxpayers who itemized their deductions to include charitable gifts, capturing about $180 billion of gifts to charity in 2012, 80 percent of the total amount given that year.
It also analyzed contributions by state and city.
Nevada residents increased the percentage of income they gave to charity by 13 percent, more than any other state, the report said. Idaho, Georgia, Connecticut and Florida also ranked high on the list of increased givers.
Utah residents gave the biggest chunk of their paycheck to charity, with $65.60 of every $1,000 earned in 2012, the report said. Many residents of Utah, which has a high Mormon population, practice tithing, the donation of 10 percent of income to the church. New Hampshire residents gave the least, with $17.40 of every $1,000 going to charity.
A survey of the four cities with the highest total incomes - Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Washington - showed declines in the amounts residents gave to charity, the report said.
Of the nation's 50 largest cities, Las Vegas residents were most generous, increasing by nearly 15 percent the portion of their income given to charities.
Buffalo, New York, residents tightened spending the most, giving 10 percent less of their pay to charities between 2006 and 2010, the report said.
Overall, the average 3 percent of income Americans give to charity remained the same as it has for decades, the report said.

Closure of Antwerp Diamond Bank impacts
A severe liquidity crunch has forced the diamond trade offer huge discounts during this festive season. While the discounts ranged from five per cent to even 20 per cent and was eating into their margins, the diamond trade was forced to off-load inventory to pay off its loans.
The liquidity crisis was precipitated by announcement of the closure of Antwerp Diamond Bank (ADB) and the news last week that Standard Chartered Bank had decided to reduce its exposure and planned to recall outstanding loans to the Indian diamond industry. ADB alone had loans of around Rs.1,200 crore to the Indian diamond industry.
Vipul Shah, Chairman, Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) told this correspondent that the situation was “very challenging” for the industry. “The impact particularly due to closure of ADB would be a Rs.600-800 crore hit for the Indian diamond industry and there will be a huge liquidity crunch due to this.”
Small and medium diamantaires were largely dependent on ADB and Standard Chartered Bank for their loan credits and in anticipation of the loan recovery process, the industry has started offering huge discounts to clear inventory. “In some cases, where traders are desperate, the discounts offered could be as high as 25 per cent,” Parag Patel, a trader in Mumbai’s diamond market, Zaveri Bazar said.
Amid the funds crunch and paucity of rough diamonds, the Surat diamond market will reportedly take a three-week Diwali 'vacation'.  
The Indian diamond jewellery industry was estimated at around $8 billion. Indian banks have in the past lent Rs.30,000-40,000 crore to the diamond trade. But of late, with very tight financing norms in place, they had reduced exposure owing to lack of transparency in operations of the trade.
“Diamond processing remains healthy with around 80 per cent of the world’s diamond cutting & polishing (C&P) taking place in India,” Ashok Minawala, Director, Danabhai Jewellers and board member of All India Gem & Jewellery Traders’ Federation said.
“But in the past banks have burnt their fingers and now do not wish to lend to the industry."  

Tata Power looks to expand global footprintNEW DELHI, October 6, 2014

Tata Power looks to expand global footprint

While the Union Government sets about revamping the policy framework for the infrastructure sector, Tata Power is setting its sights on business opportunities in Asian and north African countries.
“India continues to remain the primary focus but due to fuel shortages, land availability and other delays, we started making investments in projects in select international geographies to strengthen and diversify the portfolio,” says Tata Power MD and CEO Anil Sardana.
The company’s plan for the future includes a mix of conventional and clean energy. It intends following the same strategy in its overseas expansion. Tata Power has prioritised four regions — Africa, the Middle East, the immediate neighbourhood and South East Asia — for setting up 2,600 MW of capacity.
Mr. Sardana mentions two overseas breakthroughs in clean energy that will encourage it to target at least a quarter of its planned foreign generation capacity from this segment. A Tata Power subsidiary recently signed an agreement for developing hydro projects in Georgia for sale of power primarily to Turkey. The company has also achieved financial closure of its 230 MW wind project in South Africa.
On the Supreme Court verdict cancelling the coal block allotments, Mr. Sardana feels any effort to make good the shortfall in domestic fuel will adversely affect the economic cost of power as also the current account deficit.
He is of the view that the distribution reforms in the power sector should be an area of priority. India needs immediate distribution reforms and that too in a massive way, he says. “There is lack of political will in pursuing the reforms, and whatever is being done today is more to tick the box,” he observes.
While the power sector in India witnessed a few success stories in the last four to five years, the road ahead is challenging, he says. “There is the deteriorating coal supply situation and poor financial outlook of discoms, which is a matter of concern because the fiscal health of all associates in the value chain will get impacted. Going forward, a combination of tariff increases, distribution reforms, open access, and enforcement of the ‘obligation to serve’ is required,” says Mr. Sardana.

Boston Properties land in Springfield out of consideration for FBI HQBy Jonathan O'Connell October 6 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Late last year when Virginia officials including Democratic Sens. Mark R. Warner and Timothy M. Kaine announced  their plans to lure the FBI headquarters to Springfield, the site they proposed included 25 acres of privately owned land.
The land  borders the southeast side of federally owned property that includes a federal warehouse and a classified facility . Most of the private land is owned or controlled by Boston Properties, one of the regions biggest commercial real estate companies.
Springfield is now one of three finalists for the FBI and its 11,000 headquarters employees, but the private land is no longer a part of it. During a series of forums  the government has been holding on the FBI’s relocation, the General Services administration released a map of the proposed Springfield site, outlined in red below:

The removal of the private land, which both Boston Properties and the GSA confirmed, leaves Springfield with 58 acres for the FBI, the smallest of the three finalists but still above the 50-acre mark that had been floated as a minimum requirement.
While none of the three finalist sites is without flaws, there are some obvious obstacles to the FBI moving to Springfield, besides it being the smallest piece of land. The secure facility would need to be relocated. The GSA’s wooden warehouse there could have historic significance, which could complicate the task of demolishing it to make way for the FBI. And the soil under the properties is likely polluted with asbestos and other toxins, according to Fairfax County.
Virginia officials have not addressed these issues, at least not publicly. During a visit last week to The Washington Post, Gerald L. Gordon, executive director of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, and Sharon Bulova, chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, offered little in the way of specifics about what is being done to clear the site for the FBI.
Boston Properties, however, is still free to compete for the FBI project, as developers competing to build the new FBI headquarters aren’t required to own the land on which it is built.

Micro-Managers Anonymous -- Getting to Trust and Ownershipreddit
I want to start the leadership equivalent of a twelve-step program. At the first meeting, I want to be the first person to stand in front of my peers and announce, "My name is Niel Nickolaisen and I am a micro-manager." The goal of Micro-managers Anonymous will be to convince myself and others that micro-management is the bane of every organization on the face of the earth and that we, as leaders, need to purge our lives and our organizations of micro-management. Along with this, I want to explain the power that comes from leaders whose primary goal is to create an organizational environment of trust and ownership. The treatment for micro-management is trust and ownership.
One of the first steps in my career was as a project manager. As my experience and skills grew, so did the scale and scope of the projects I managed. My crowning project management achievement was the on-time, on-budget, on-scope delivery of a major information systems project. I managed a team of over 125 full-time people. Through my amazing project management capabilities, we delivered this project - through disruptions such as a CEO change and a major acquisition. At the close of the project, I felt at the top of my project management game. Even better, my amazing project results led to a promotion.
Within a month of completing the project, I was promoted to the role Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the company. From my new, lofty perch, I wanted to share my project management expertise with my new staff. In my spare time, I created a training program and guidebook that defined every step needed to ensure project success. I scheduled the training session and printed enough copies of the guidebook (70 pages of profundity) for anyone on my staff who was tangentially involved with managing projects. The night before the training session, I reviewed my masterpiece. I had, in just 70 pages, outlined the nearly minute-by-minute activities of a quality project manager.
During my review, a thought entered my head and the thought would not leave -- my expertise at project management had turned me into a project management micro-manager. I wanted everyone to do everything just the way I did things. I wanted to prescribe every action, every communication, every report.
With the little time I had left, I revised my guidebook and training content. I reduced 70 pages of micro-management to a half-page of project guidelines (for example, communicate to stakeholders frequently and if the project news is bad, the sooner the communication the better). The next day, we talked through the guidelines and how they might apply to their lives and projects. I then focused my attention on my recovery by becoming a leader who created a culture of trust and ownership.
What does it mean to create a culture of trust and ownership? At the highest level, it means that I, as a leader, describe what needs to be done and why it matters and then trust my teams to figure out how to make that happen. I do not tell them how to do anything - even if they ask. In my role as the master of What and Why, I never track or measure How - that belongs to the team and I trust them to figure it out. Should the team need help, I provide advice but avoid telling them how to do something or, worse, how I would do anything.
Best of all, this approach not only works but works amazingly well. The vast majority of people, if given ownership and trusted to deliver, will deliver.
When I speak in front of an audience about cultures of trust and ownership, I start by asking, "How many of you have ever worked for a micro-manager?" Every hand in the audience goes up. I then ask, "How many of you, and keep your hands up, enjoyed the micro-management experience and thought it resulted in your doing the best work of your career?" Not a hand has ever remained up.
Trust and ownership free everyone to do their best work. If you need some help to overcome your micro-management, please look for a chapter of Micro-managers Anonymous opening near you soon.

Another Step Towards Ecological Seafood Menusreddit
In a prior blog, I asserted that to move closer to a sustainable seafood menu I had observed these simple steps that chefs were taking at top restaurants as well as kitchens in more casual eateries when they worked with CleanFish.  I stated that the "formula" I had learned from these chefs went like this:
• Source well
• Price well
• Tell your people the story of the fish you are serving.
Then, in a subsequent blog I spent some ink breaking down the first important step, Source Well. In this writing I'd like to breakdown the second step:
Step Two: Portion Well
This step may seem easier. That's cause it is. And yet, it rubs against a rather persistent image-driven set of social messages that are more powerful than one might think: Size Matters.
With regard to sustainability, size does matter rather a bit, and our choices around seafood are core to why our oceans are being depleted and habitats destroyed at levels that cannot be adequately replenished, unless we change what we are doing.
Let's look, for example, at All-You-Can-Eat buffet bars. Like customary offerings of 22oz. Porterhouse Steakhouse servings, our desire to express our sense of no limits plays itself out in food enterprises across the nation. Television and roadside billboard ads tell me that we males of the species thrive on this level of gluttonous indulgence. That's what and just how much a real man eats. Whenever he wants it.
Really?
Then, there is the opposite food image of the refined white tablecloth multi-star restaurant with a ice cube sized piece of protein surrounded by a puree of seasonal vegetable on a 14 inch plate, perhaps a Zen brush stroke of dramatic colorful pepper sauce set off by a presenting cloth swiped around the outside of the plate to emphasize the preciousness of the exquisitely presented single mouthful, maybe two, of your oh-so-select protein entree. And that is the kind of prized presentation aesthetic that cultured foodies deeply appreciate...
Really?
I see neither of these above images of food delivery as defining what people want. My friend Barton Seaver, National Geographic Fellow, sustainable seafood chef and cookbook author of For Cod and Country, also Director of the Healthy and Sustainable Food Program at the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard's School of Public Health, made this point rather directly in his TED talk some few years ago. He makes the issues of scale in eating fish rather often. In Chef Seaver's TED talk, he calls us all to relish a plate of 4-5 ounces of a protein from the sea and pile that plate higher with vegetables. That makes for a mixed broth on the plate that enhances both elements with a taste of the season that we can all deeply enjoy and -- at the same time celebrate our participation in ocean conservation.
Regarding the matter of size, realize that we all need to learn more about the species of the sea. The more we know of them, the more we'll be inclined to protect them. If you are going to eat seafood, it is truly useful to educate yourself about the status of the fish you most enjoy. There have been waves of culinary trends that have had devastating impacts on fisheries. As if popular dishes of, say, Blackened Red Fish, can suddenly become national crazes and all of us pretend we can willingly act in denial of how we impact fish stocks with our food choices. Over the past 40 years, or so, we have seen eating fads, such as Blackened redfish; Chilean sea bass; Orange roughy; cod and Bluefin sushi all bring species to the point of exhaustion or actual extinction of the very fish we value. Does the size of our appetites for targeted species matter? Well, over 90 percent of the large fish of our seas are now extinct. Our fixation on larger fish, such as Bluefin tuna, or swordfish, are edging those species ever closer to the day when they will not be available, ever again. Ever.
Dr. Mark Hyman the Blood, Sugar Solution bestseller, is continually pointing out, that this conventional marketplace invitation for huge portions and all-you-can-stuff is directly related to the 'diebesity' epidemic running havoc in our health system. Knowing more about the roles of different fish in sea ecosystems in also key to our eating well and playing a truly possible role in not only stopping this current trend toward sea ecosystem exhaustion, but rather be actively part of voting with our forks for ocean restoration.
The next aspect of size mattering is starting to provide feedback to the chefs that we don't really need 8-10 ounces of fish on a plate to make a nourishing delicious meal.  Again, a plate of 4-5 ounces of a protein from the sea and more vegetables enhances both food elements with a taste of the season that we can all deeply enjoy and at the same time be part of ocean conservation. All chefs can do this. It works.
Scale seems critical in finding producers whose practices go beyond "sustainability". I find producers who are developing practices that truly move toward restorative and regenerative conditions for our seas, rivers and lakes. They just tend not go be so driven by industrial scale dictates. One of the most important moves you can make to support ocean restoration is to take the crushing pressure off the wild stocks altogether by moving some of our seafood choices to aquaculture. Yes, that's right, I am stating that farmed fish can be the very best choice for ocean conservationists to make.
What we have learned over and again at CleanFish is that the concerns about the potential negative impacts of fish farming are directly related to principles, practices, and scale. For those concerned about, and committed to sustainable seafood choices, a better question at your next dinner table, be it at home or in a restaurant, is NOT, "Is this farmed or wild". Rather a more defining question regarding concerns you might well have about environmental impacts is, "Is this fish from an industrial scale operation, or a more artisan scale fishery?"
Whether we are taking about the size of the fishing operation, or the size of the fish portion serving on our plates, size matters; and smaller is beautiful.

America s Ridiculously Rich: The 2014 Editionreddit
Imagine yourself part of the typical American family. Your household would have, the Federal Reserve reported last month, a net worth of $81,200.
Not much. But 50 percent of America's households would actually have less wealth than you do. The other half would have more.
Now imagine that your net worth suddenly quadrupled to about $325,000. That sum would place you within the ranks of America's most affluent 20 percent of income earners. You would be "typical" no more. On the other hand, you still wouldn't be rich, or even close to grand fortune.
So suppose we quadrupled your wealth still again, enough to get your net worth -- your assets minus your debts -- all the way up to $1.3 million.
Congratulations. You now hold 16 times more wealth than the typical American. You probably have paid off your mortgage. You have a healthy balance in your 401(k). You have investment income. You have it made.
But not really. You still have to worry financially, about everything from losing your job to helping your kids with their college tuition.
So let's quadruple your net worth once again -- to $5.2 million.
You now sit comfortably within the ranks of America's richest 1 percent. You can afford, well, just about anything you want. A getaway in the mountains, another getaway on the shore. Two beamers in the driveway. Impressive philanthropic gestures. Direct access to your U.S. senators.
Enough already? Actually, no. With a fortune of just $5.2 million, you still have to put up with the inconveniences of mere mortal existence. Yes, you can fly first class anywhere you want. But you have to fly with the great unwashed back in coach -- and they take forever getting their carry-ons up in those overhead bins.
You need relief. We're going to give it to you. We're going to multiply your $5.2 million fortune 1,000 times over -- to $5.2 billion. Now you can buy your own private jet.
Even better, now you get your name printed in the annual Forbes magazine list of America's 400 richest. At $5.2 billion, your fortune would nearly rate as an average Forbes 400 stash. America's top 400, Forbes revealed last week, now hold a combined net worth of $2.29 trillion. That places the average Forbes 400 fortune at $5.7 billion, an all-time record high.
Remember back when you held that median American nest-egg of $81,200? The average member of the Forbes 400 holds a fortune over 70,000 times that size.
And the richest of these 400 hold far more than that average. Take Larry Ellison, the third-ranking deep pocket on this year's Forbes list. Ellison just stepped down as the CEO of the Oracle business software colossus. His net worth: $50 billion.
What does Ellison do with all those billions? He collects homes and estates, for starters, with 15 or so scattered all around the world. Ellison likes yachts, too. He currently has two extremely big ones, each over half as long as a football field.
Ellison also likes to play basketball, even on his yachts. If a ball bounces over the railing, no problem. Ellison has a powerboat following his yacht, the Wall Street Journal noted this past spring, "to retrieve balls that go overboard."
Hiring that ball-retriever qualifies Ellison a "job creator," right? Maybe not. Ellison has regularly destroyed jobs on his way to grand fortune. He has become, over the years, a master of the merge-and-purge two-step: First you snatch your rival's customers, then you fire its workers.
In 2005, for instance, Ellison shelled out $10.6 billion to buy out PeopleSoft, an 11,000-employee competitor. He then proceeded to put the ax to 5,000 jobs .
Five years later, Ellison bought out Sun Microsystems and indignantly denied that any "massive layoff" would be in the offing. Five months later, Ellison's Oracle quietly acknowledged a major downsizing in an official federal regulatory filing.
Job massacres like these been hollowing out America's middle class ever since Forbes started annually identifying the nation's richest 400 back in the 1980s. Since 1989, Federal Reserve figures show , the median net worth of families in America's statistical middle class -- the middle 20 percent of income earners -- has dropped from $75,300 to $61,700, after taking inflation into account.
This year, for the first time ever, Forbes has assigned a "self-made score" to every one of America's richest 400. More than two-thirds of this year's 400, Forbes claims , rate as "self-made," Ellison among them.
Forbes doesn't bother asking how those rich went about self-making their fortunes. We should. Our top 400, after all, haven't just made monstrously large fortunes. They've made a monstrously large mess. To unmake it, we need to unmake them.

What Are the Rules for Employers Checking Your Creditreddit
It seems that no matter what you want to do these days, someone wants a peek at your credit history. Not only do lenders and insurers want to see what you are up to, but even some employers look at your credit report as part of a background check.
According to a 2012 survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management , about 47 percent of employers use some sort of credit check to make hiring decisions. The idea is that it's possible to get an idea of what your weaknesses might be, or where you might be vulnerable.
For jobs that involve handling money, or that might involve proprietary secrets, concerns about financial problems (and the temptation to embezzle or take bribes) can seem valid. But, even if you aren't in such a position, an employer might still want to have a look at your credit report.
Is an Employer Allowed to Look at Your Credit Report?
"Employers may only look at a consumer's credit report with that consumer's written consent," says Meredith Griffanti, the Senior Director of Public Relations at Equifax Inc. That means that when you are applying for a job, employers are only supposed to look at your credit report after you have given them permission in writing.
If you are asked to provide that consent, you can always say no. However, this creates a bit of a dilemma for many would-be workers. "If a consumer is concerned about an employer looking at their report, they should not authorize it," says Griffanti.
But it's not always so easy.
What happens if your employer takes your refusal to consent as evidence that there is something seriously amiss with your credit report ? While state laws vary on what employers are allowed to do, it doesn't seem like a stretch to consider that just about any hiring manager can find a non-credit-report-related reason to hire someone else over you, should you balk at agreeing to a credit pull by the company.
It's important to recognize, though, that your credit report is not the same thing as your credit score. Employers are not supposed to look at your credit score, and many credit reporting agencies make it a point to only include specific information on reports obtained for employment background checks.
What Do Employers See?
"Employers may only look at limited aspects of a consumer's credit report," says Griffanti. "Your Equifax credit file includes identifying information, inquiry information, public record, and collection information."
Here is the information that Griffanti says an employer is likely to see if he or she pulls your credit report as part of an employment background check (with your permission, of course):
Identifying information. This includes information such as your name, address, Social Security Number, date of birth and employment information. This information is not used in credit scoring. Updates to this information is typically received from information provided when applying for credit or benefits.
Trade lines are your credit accounts. Data furnishers report information on accounts you have established with them such as the type of account (bank card, auto loan, mortgage, etc), the date you opened the account, your credit limit or loan amount, the account balance and your payment history.
Inquiry information contains information about companies that have requested and/or viewed your credit report information typically within the last two years.
Public Record and/or Collection Information such as judgments, tax liens and bankruptcies may be reflected on your credit file. Your credit file may also contain collection account information for debts that have been turned over to an outside collection agency.
Even without your credit score, this is information that offers a fairly comprehensive view of your financial situation. If an employer thinks that your credit report has red flags that indicate that you might be willing to accept bribes in exchange for secrets, or that your financial troubles could lead to embezzlement, you might not be hired.
Griffanti won't speculate on whether or not would-be employers could use this information to approximate your score, only pointing out that scores are not provided to employers, and that the information above is the only information made available to employers.
Know Your State Law and Your Rights
Remember that you have rights. First of all, you don't have to agree to let your current employer or a potential employer look at your credit report. Next, you should know your state's laws regarding uses of credit reports, especially as they relate to hiring and other employment issues.
You should also know that you can have incorrect information on your credit report changed. It makes sense to keep tabs on your credit. There are a number of free consumer credit sites like Quizzle and Credit Karma , as well as AnnualCreditReport.com , that can provide you with insight into your current situation. If there are mistakes that could drag down your score, or present you in a negative light, consider writing to the credit reporting agency to have the mistake fixed . You have a right to make sure the information in your credit report is correct, and accurately represents you.
Educate yourself, and if you aren't sure whether or not to give permission to an employer (or potential employer) to check your credit report, think twice before signing the form.

New Film Questions The Meaning Of  Women s Workreddit
Women have made great strides in the workplace since the  sixties , but we  a re still making 78 cents for each dollar a man earns, and there's still a discrepancy in what's considered "women's work" and what's deemed a "man's job." The most common occupation for women today is still the same as it was 50 years ago: secretary. In the upcoming documentary, Hard Hatted Woman, filmmaker Lorien Barlow explores gender stereotypes entrenched in the workforce by shining a spotlight on an industry that has remained stubbornly male even despite federal interventions in the late '70s: construction -- where less than 3% of workers are women.
Barlow began developing the project in the fall of 2012 , and  since then, she has interviewed dozens of tradeswomen from all over the country. Not wanting to go into construction work, she  discovered , isn't the sole reason why women are barely present in the sector .  "Somewhere along the way, these women are leaving the trades in significant numbers ," she said. "  From all my research over the past two years, it seems the culture of construction is the hardest thing to endure, not the work itself."
" The isolation can be very unsettling. Imagine being the only woman on the job. Imagine never seeing anyone else like you. You're singled out, everyone notices you. ..  And construction workers move from jobsite to jobsite, and at each one they have a new foreman, new crew, a new social environment to navigate. It's a repetitive stress."
- Lorien Barlow  , producer and director of Hard Hatted Woman
Amy James Neel,  job developer at Oregon Tradeswomen, Inc. , says female workers  are not taken seriously, and therefore have a hard time getting the training and skills they will need to advance : "S o many of our apprentices go out into the field, and they're pushing a broom. After three years, they're still pushing a broom ."   One female apprentice  described to the filmmaker her experience  working in construction as "death by a thousand cuts , " referring to the assumptions that women confront daily -- assumptions that deny female workers the opportunities to prove they can do the job; and a carpenter told Barlow  working   in construction as a woman is like working two full-time jobs: " Your first job is being a worker. Your second job is dealing with the emotional challenges of being a woman in this work ."
Among the personal and political barriers that are blocking tradeswomen's access to high-wage careers in construction, the lack awareness of the actual issue -- resulting in a lack of solidarity among women in trades -- is an interesting obstacle. "It's also risky to be an agitator ,"  explains the filmmaker: "They're just trying to keep their jobs. There's politics involved, and sometimes it can feel like you have no choice but to keep your mouth shut and play the game, even if the rules are unfair."
"Feminism means understanding that the concept of gender has been constructed by society, it's not an absolute, and these constructions cannot be allowed to dictate our lives and our right to self-determination. Feminism also means understanding that females have historically been profoundly disempowered by these social constructions, but that they hurt men as well -- males are confined by different but also limiting and harmful gender roles. Feminism is understanding all this and being conscious of it in the world around you, identifying it, feeling where it hurts, and making an effort to challenge these dynamics."
- Lorien Barlow
Francoise Jacobsohn, co-chair of the National Taskforce on Tradeswomen's Issues, defined the construction industry as the  " last frontier "  in male dominated fields ,  but this isn't an issue confined to the construction sector. The social beliefs about women's aptitudes and abilities also play a part on impeding the numbers of women in male-dominated industries to grow. Barlow explains the most subtle barriers happen when girls are young, through a much bigger cultural factor: "By the time girls are in middle school or high school, they've already absorbed messages about what's within and beyond their abilities. Their proclivities and interests have already been shaped by a host of messages that ultimately steer them away from physically and technically demanding work [...]. Which is shame, because this can be really fun and satisfying work." To really change the culture and eliminate these attitudes that lead to female discrimination, more women need to be doing the work. It all starts, I believe, with a collective social awareness of the issue. Lorien Barlow thinks    "maybe it's about applying just the right amount of pressure from all sides to crack this problem" -- and that is quite a woman's job.

Hewlett-Packard Is Giving Up on Better Together. Will Other Tech Stalwarts FollowScreenshot from YouTube
Hewlett-Packard, the multinational sellers of PCs, printers, and enterprise software, said Monday that it is splitting its business down the middle. HP's information technology operations—software, data storage, computer services—will be bundled into Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and keep current HP CEO Meg Whitman at its helm. Its PC arm will spin off as HP Inc. and hang onto the current HP logo, with Whitman as chairman of the board and Dion Weisler as chief executive. In the previous year, revenues in the to-be-separated components of HP were so great that each one alone would have ranked among Fortune's 50 largest U.S. companies .
The transaction, which is expected to be completed by October 2015, is being billed as a key part of the five-year turnaround plan Whitman unveiled in 2012. "The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan," Whitman said in a statement . "It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders."
Advertisement
While that may be true, it's a remarkable change—or you could say turnaround—in stance for Whitman, who had previously insisted that the various components of HP were " better together ." The decision to break up the company comes one week after eBay had a similar change of heart and said it would spin off its payments arm, PayPal, into a separate publicly traded company. Both Whitman and eBay CEO John Donahoe cited fast-paced change as chief among the reasons to split. HP is one of several technology veterans that has struggled to keep up as customers turn from personal computers to mobile devices and cloud computing systems.
Analysts are split on whether HP's decision is the right move. Several told Reuters that the separation process could be disruptive and seemed to come from " weakness, not strength ." At investment firm Morningstar, analyst Peter Wahlstrom wrote that "we believe this is strategically the right move." As part of the split, HP will lay off 5,000 people. Shares of Hewlett-Packard were up around 5 percent to just over $37 on the news as of early afternoon.
Could HP's split signal the end of an era for tech stalwarts? Jim Kelleher, director of research at Argus Research, wrote in an analyst note that HP's announcement "will ripple through the industry" and "may sound the death knell for the 'one-stop shop' technology model." He also expects pressure will increase on IBM to divide into a services business and a software and hardware one. "Even if IBM does not act immediately to change its structure, calls for a shake-up will not go away," Kelleher wrote. "There are more and more activist investors anxious to shake up even companies formerly seen as sacrosanct."
On the other hand, this is not the first time that HP has spun off part of its business. In 1999, it released the division that became Agilent to better keep pace with the Internet boom. Considering how many people think we're now living through a second tech bubble , the spinoff timing might not be so surprising.

encounters
Those who are enlightened in the police should welcome the proposed judicial scrutiny of encounters, rather than look at it as being one more unreasonable fetter on police discretion in an area of field operations that could dilute their effectiveness
The Supreme Court’s guidelines on how to regulate so-called “encounters” between the police and crime suspects have come not a day too soon. According to its directions, every death at police hands in such encounters must be independently investigated and no officer be rewarded for gallantry unless such investigation has established his bona fide response to criminal activity in a difficult situation, and which left him with no option but to use force against an established criminal. The reference here is to so-called “encounter experts” in every police force who are often wrongly decorated for dubious killings.
The court’s directions further say that each death should be probed by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or a team from a police station other than the one involved in the “encounter.” The report would then go to a magistrate for further scrutiny. The law would take its own course thereafter, if any illegality was unearthed by the magisterial inquiry.
Possible trickledown effect
The Supreme Court’s prescriptions do not lay down any revolutionary approach to the problem. At least two other High Courts — Andhra Pradesh and Bombay — have acted in the past to enforce similar restrictions on police employment of force under dubious circumstances. Way back in the late 1970s, the National Police Commission had recommended that every death in police custody should be subjected to a magisterial inquiry. Unfortunately, this was not accepted by the Central and State governments.
In the latest instance, the Supreme Court was responding to a Public-Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) which had alleged that in Mumbai alone, between 1995 and 1997, there were 99 encounters involving the city police, resulting in the death of 135 people. Perceptions on the subject may differ widely between the police, human rights activists and the common man. Fundamental however is a shared belief in the rule of law, without which no democracy like ours can ever function. It is again the majesty of law that permits the Supreme Court to intervene effectively in a sensitive issue such as police killings of individuals and lay down how an instance of apparent police overstepping of the law should be handled. This is why all of us need to bow down to the wisdom of the just laid down judicial dictum that no “encounter” death in the hands of the police should go uninvestigated. Enlightened police leaders should wholeheartedly welcome the proposed judicial scrutiny of encounters, rather than take the stand that this is one more unreasonable fetter on police discretion in an area of field operations that could dilute their effectiveness. They must recognise how such a legalistic stand prescribed by the Supreme Court here could actually confer on them the benefit of a trickledown effect on other areas of police routine as well, ones in which they are under great unethical pressure from different quarters to do the wrong thing. A possible fallout of the court ruling, at least among a section of policemen at the grass-roots level, could be greater transparency and circumspection in matters such as illegal or off-the-record custody in police lock-ups, something that has traditionally brought odium to the Indian Police. A police officer wanting to do the right thing but who is being harassed by supervisory ranks or the political executive can now cite this ruling and take the bold stand that whatever he did was likely to be subjected to a subsequent judicial probe, and sticking to the path of virtue as embodied by law was therefore preferable to action not prescribed by law.
Factors and balanced view
In this, there is a fundamental question that has to be answered in the context of the latest ruling by the court. Why do “encounters” take place at all in the first instance? Are we right in looking upon every police officer who has been arraigned in the past for a few fake encounters as a maniac baying for blood? We concede that we do have encounters that are fake and contrived. In many of them, the policemen involved do successfully cover up their downright recklessness or vindictiveness, or their own indiscretion. Many sceptics in society believe this dim view of police encounters to be true.
There is also a charitable view that policemen indulge in such reprehensible activity only because of the glaring inadequacies of the criminal law of the land. There is conviction among many police officers that if a dangerous criminal responsible for many violent crimes has to be neutralised swiftly and society be saved from him, then the only way out is to kill him; this, rather than go through the labyrinth of the law that requires an arrest, interrogation, charge sheet and court trial, all of which could take several years during which time a court could also set him free from custody even as he is facing trial. Such a shortcut is actually very appealing to many field officers as well as some members of the community who themselves have been at the receiving end and expect quick relief from criminal acts. This is analogous to the demand that during interrogation, the police should liberally use the third degree on crime suspects taken into custody. It is well known that such a clamour is often voiced by even responsible members of the society who had been burgled and lost valuable property.
When this is the case, we should not be surprised at the recklessness of some investigating officers, under pressure from those above in the hierarchy and who are desperately looking for quick results. We should also remember that it is not as if only crime suspects are victims of encounters. A large number of policemen have also lost their lives in such encounters, especially in the naxalite areas. Therefore, we need to take a balanced view of factors that lead to the police using questionable methods in handling difficult field situations.
Respect for dignity
We welcome the Supreme Court directive for an inquiry into every police encounter that leads to human killings. We are conscious of the fact that we could be assailed by some in the Indian Police as being too idealistic and impractical. We do not claim that the new procedure to check police excesses is going to put an end to police manipulation or recklessness for all time. This is especially because magisterial inquiries are often an eyewash and are dictated by the political executive as well as by senior members of the bureaucracy at the former’s instance. In our view they do not pack the quantum of deterrence or credibility needed to bring about a sea-change in the police psyche. The incidence of police misconduct of this genre may show a decline to start with. In course of time however, a few unscrupulous police leaders could prevail upon their subordinates to resort to encounters as a way to tone down public criticism whenever there is a rising crime wave. This is inevitable in a large police organisation like in India where professionalism is rapidly yielding place to expediency of the times.
Good conduct cannot be engendered only through deterrence and punishment arising out of judicial prescriptions. What is needed is the slow and studied cultivation of a respect for human dignity. This is unfortunately now a scarce commodity in the Indian Police — sometimes even in the higher echelons. Political and police enlightenment should go hand in hand if we are to witness civilised police conduct.

Berlin Packaging completes $1.43 billion deal0
Oak Hill said it purchased the company in concert with Berlin Packaging's current management team from Bahrain-based investment firm Investcorp Bank. The company's chairman and CEO Andrew Berlin is retaining a "significant ownership position" the companies said. Berlin created Berlin Packaging in 1988 with the acquisition of Alco Packaging. He and the current management team will continue to manage the business.
Berlin packaging has grown significantly over the past four years by buying out other packaging companies, including Continental Packaging Solutions, Lerman Container and United States Container Corp. The company’s website says its annual sales are approaching $800 million with more than 90 sales and warehouse locations across North America. It is headquartered on West Monroe Street.

$8 million more for app that lets you shop via mobile  then pick up at the curb0
Chicago Ventures was part of an initial $1.5 million seed round, led by AME Cloud Ventures’ Founding Partner Jerry Yang just over a year ago, Larkins said. The Series A round of $8 million was announced Monday, led by San Francisco and London-based Index Ventures, Larkins said.
Larkins declined to release the dollar amount of Chicago Ventures’ investment in the company.
Larkins acknowledged that the space for convenience-craving shoppers is crowded with companies offering same-day delivery, but he thinks Curbside’s approach has promise. It charges the retailer, not the consumer, for the service and avoids getting into the delivery business itself.
“They are taking a little bit different approach” by not offering delivery, Larkins said. “It’s working in the places where they’ve tried it.”
Index Ventures General Partner Mike Volpi, in a blog post released on the company’s website Monday, explained why he thinks Curbside will compete successfully against same-day delivery models from Amazon Fresh, Google Shopping Express and others. He notes that “same-day delivery is really expensive to pull off” and delivery schedules have built-in hindrances to convenience, while costs are typically passed on to the consumer.
The $1.5 million seed round was joined by Chicago Ventures, O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, TenOneTen, WGI Group and individuals including former Yahoo! president and current Costco board member Sue Decker and former Visa president and CEO Carl F. Pascarella, according to Curbside’s statement Monday. Larkins said all of the seed investors have signed on to the Series A round.

Go Ahead  Act Like a Guy: Body Language Advice for Womenreddit
"Whatever you do, don't use your hands when you speak."
Many female clients in my consulting practice have told me that other, uh, advisors, of the male variety, imparted this conventional "wisdom."  Why?  Because "gestures will make you look aggressive or unprofessional!"  Huh?
These enlightened told the women to leave their arms at their sides, or, worse, to clasp their hands in front.  If you don't believe this, ask around.  Probably three quarters of women executives will say they received "instruction" of this sort.
So why is it OK for men to gesture, and not women?  Why would a guy look like a proverbial stiff with his hands linked in front, while a woman would seem more professional in that pose?  Hard to imagine this in 2014, isn't it?
The only rule of body language is to be yourself.  Actually, I take that back.  You need to be the most effective, boldest self you can be -- all within the confines of your personality.
If gestures don't come naturally -- that is, if your body language is "quiet" -- then by all means don't move your hands when you speak.  Otherwise you'll be chopping the air for no apparent reason, like a dime-store imitation of an opera singer.
On the other hand (no pun intended), if you ordinarily gesticulate with gusto and suddenly stop, people will think you're flatlining.
What about podiums?  Many female clients have told me that they were instructed (usually early in their careers, by male managers) to firmly grip the sides of the podium.  Can you imagine Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton clutching the wood to appear more authoritative?  Doesn't their gravitas emanate from who they are and what they say rather than from their ability to become a monolith with a column of walnut?  Remember: Podiums are nothing more than barriers.  So walk away and reveal yourself to the audience.  We can't read your body language if we can't see your body.
May I point out, however, that there are gender differences with regard to nonverbal communication.  I offer this list of poor habits that women often display when speaking:
• Folding your arms across your torso, as if caressing yourself.  This will make you look uncertain, lonely or self-centered.
• Touching your face with your hands.  This is a defensive pose, especially if you reach across to the opposite cheek.
• Failing to complete a handshake. As a general rule, extend your hand until you lock thumbs with the other person. If you don't reach far enough, then the palms won't meld, and you'll seem tentative.
• Sitting on your jacket (à la Broadcast News).  This position will remove slack in the material and square your shoulders, but it is one of the worst things you can do.  How can you move freely if your clothing is taut across your back? (This caveat applies equally to men.)
• Sitting up straight.  This works in the military, but not in real life, unless you are fortune enough to possess the sort of posture that ballet dancers enjoy.  I have observed that former dancers can walk into a room ramrod-straight, maintain that vertical line as they sit down, and accomplish the maneuver with consummate ease.  The rest of us will look ridiculously formal if we try to imitate them.  (My daughter spent many years as a ballerina, so my eyes are trained in this regard.)
Audiences are much smarter than you think.  They can quickly determine whether you're at ease, even if you think you're fooling them.  If you try too hard to project a certain persona, then you are interposing that role between yourself and the rest of us.  Don't act; just be.
Studies have shown that women are naturally more fluent in body language than men.  For instance, they are said to be more accurate and more sensitive in labeling facial expressions.  This advantage manifests itself across many cultures and has been shown to begin as early as age 3 .  Another study shows that women are more accurate than men 80 percent of the time in nonverbal sensitivity overall -- better at analyzing not just facial expressions but body and voice cues.  Moreover, they have more gray matter in the sections of the limbic system involved in emotional processing.
My own experience confirms that women are more adept at not only receiving nonverbal messages but transmitting them as well.  Both of these skills provide an essential edge in business. So why should they hold back?
Women should not rein in but "rein out."  When it comes to gesturing, they win the arms race, uh, hands down.  And consultants who don't celebrate this should never be invited back to your company again.

Why the debate over real names on the Web matters -- for drag queens on Facebook and everyone elseBy Caitlin Dewey October 6 Follow @caitlindewey

Since its inglorious start in Mark Zuckerberg’s dorm room 10 years ago, Facebook has had one fundamental, incontrovertible policy on names: You must use your “real” one, no matter what.
That’s always put the world’s largest social network at odds with other major sites, like Twitter and Myspace, that let you go under any name or nonsense you want. And last month, after a crackdown that locked dozens of drag queens out of the site, it also put Facebook at odds with the LGBT community, who claimed the real-name policy jeopardized their safety and their rights.
In response, and after lots of bad press, Facebook did an unusual about-face: It would no longer require legal names, necessarily — but it would require “authentic” names, a.k.a. the name you go by in day-to-day life.
Post by Chris Cox .
It’s a matter of principle, Facebook’s Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said . Facebook doesn’t want to be like the icky anonymous Web. Facebook wants to be “a force for good.” And names, it turns out, are on the frontline of that battle between Internet good and evil — one of the last stopgaps keeping Internet dialog from sliding backwards into a 4chan-style pit.
Why does the real-names debate matter? Because it’s an issue of identity and inclusion, of course. But it’s also about way more than that. Facebook’s decision to police real names, even after other networks have given up the effort, is an attempt to civilize — and thus, colonize — the social Web.
What’s in a name?
When you choose a username online, you essentially have one of two choices. One: Use your real name and forever bolt your digital persona to your real-life identity, with all the obligations and benefits and dangers that entails. Two: Use a fake name, or no name at all, and divorce your online activity from your real-life self.
Whenever we talk about real names online, we’re really talking about personal identity. More than that, we’re talking about personal responsibility: Should you be held accountable for what you say and do online … or not? And who is holding you “accountable,” quote-unquote, for the collective breadcrumbs you drop online — your IRL friends? The government? The advertisers who pay dearly for every dribble of information about your “real,” money-spending self?
The case for real-names
It seems like a question with an easy answer, but there are compelling arguments on each side. Cox, of Facebook, argued that holding users accountable for their online actions cuts down on abuse: “The stories of mass impersonation, trolling, domestic abuse and higher rates of bullying and intolerance are oftentimes the result of people hiding behind fake names,” he notes. And that’s true.
Studies suggest that anonymous users are meaner and more argumentative than named users; history suggests that many of the Internet’s grimmest transgressions — from peddling child porn to cyberbullying classmates — are carried out under cover of a fake user name. Think of all the bad Internet news you’ve read in the past year: the brutal death and rape threats tweeted to British politicians , the cruel bullying of Robin Williams’s bereaved daughter , the hacking of dozens of celebrity nudes . In every case, the perpetrator acted under an alias or handle or other obfuscation that hid him or her from ultimate responsibility.
To quote Huffington Post managing editor Jimmy Soni, who banned anonymous comments on that site a year ago, “we are capable of doing far worse things to one another when we do not have to own up to the things we do.” But that’s not all, of course: We’re also capable of doing more dangerous and more transgressive things, too.
The case for pseudonyms
Pacific Standard supplies some convincing examples : A transitioning transgender activist, who hasn’t come out to all of his real-life acquaintances — but wants to discuss the process online; an Egyptian blogger who uses a pseudonym to protect himself from repercussions; a porn star who doesn’t want creepy fans to glimpse too much of her daily life. In fact, you can probably think of any number of performers and activists and whistleblowers who need to maintain some kind of gap between their real and online identities — not only for their personal comfort but for their safety, their personal expression and their quality of life.
This is, of course, why civil libertarians advocate fiercely for Internet anonymity: It’s the primary guarantee that Internet users will be allowed to express themselves freely, safe from the prying eyes of governments, corporations or unfriendly neighbors. In a reversal of its own short-lived, controversial policy on real-names, Google echoed that logic: “We hope that today’s change is a step toward making Google+ the welcoming and inclusive place we want it to be,” a company blog post read.
Unfortunately, no name policy can ever protect everyone. That’s the thorny Catch-22 at the core of the whole debate. Pseudonyms will shield some vulnerable users, like the members of the LGBT community who lobbied Facebook for a change. But pseudonyms will also inevitably shield trolls, bullies and other Internet villains, from the violent misogynists who threatened Anita Sarkeesian to the nasty teenagers that have pushed several young girls to suicide via Ask.fm.
There’s quite a lot of drama bound up in a name, it turns out. More, perhaps, than even Facebook can deal with.

Why We Allow Big Pharma to Rip Us Offreddit
According to a new federal database put online last week, pharmaceutical companies and device makers paid doctors some $380 million in speaking and consulting fees over a five-month period in 2013.
Some doctors received over half a million dollars each, and others got millions of dollars in royalties from products they helped develop.
Doctors claim these payments have no effect on what they prescribe. But why would drug companies shell out all this money if it didn't provide them a healthy return on their investment?
America spends a fortune on drugs, more per person than any other nation on earth, even though Americans are no healthier than the citizens of other advanced nations.
Of the estimated $2.7 trillion America spends annually on health care, drugs account for 10 percent of the total.
Government pays some of this tab through Medicare, Medicaid, and subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. But we pick up the tab indirectly through our taxes.
We pay the rest of it directly, through higher co-payments, deductibles, and premiums.
Drug company payments to doctors are a small part of a much larger strategy by Big Pharma to clean our pockets.
Another technique is called "product hopping" -- making small and insignificant changes in a drug whose patent is about to expire, so it's technically new.
For example, last February, before its patent expired on Namenda, its widely used drug to treat Alzheimer's, Forest Laboratories announced it would stop selling the existing tablet form of in favor of new extended-release capsules called Namenda XR.
The capsules were just a reformulated version of the tablet. But even the minor change prevented pharmacists from substituting generic versions of the tablet.
Result: Higher profits for Forest Labs and higher costs for you and me.
Another technique is for drug companies to continue to aggressively advertise prescription brands long after their twenty-year patents have expired, so patients ask their doctors for them. Many doctors will comply.
America is one of few advanced nations that allow direct advertising of prescription drugs.
A fourth tactic is for drug companies to pay the makers of generic drugs to delay their cheaper versions. These so-called "pay-for-delay" agreements generate big profits for both the proprietary manufacturers and the generics. But here again, you and I pay. The tactic costs us an estimated $3.5 billion a year.
Europe doesn't allow these sorts of payoffs, but they're legal in the United States because the major drug makers and generics have fought off any legislative attempts to stop them.
Finally, while other nations set wholesale drug prices, the law prohibits the U.S. government from using its considerable bargaining power under Medicare and Medicaid to negotiate lower drug prices. This was part of the deal Big Pharma extracted for its support of the Affordable Care Act of 2010.
The drug companies say they need the additional profits to pay for researching and developing new drugs.
But the government supplies much of the research Big Pharma relies on, through the National Institutes of Health.
Meanwhile, Big Pharma is spending more on advertising and marketing than on research and development - often tens of millions to promote a single drug.
And it's spending hundreds of millions more every year lobbying. Last year alone, the lobbying tab came to $225 million , according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
That's more than the formidable lobbying expenditures of America's military contractors.
In addition, Big Pharma is spending heavily on political campaigns. In 2012, it shelled out over $36 million , making it the biggest political contributor of all American industries.
Why do we put up with this? It's too facile to say we have no choice given how much the industry is spending on politics. If the public were sufficiently outraged, politicians and regulatory agencies wouldn't allow this giant ripoff.
But the public isn't outraged. That's partly because much of this strategy is hidden from public view.
But I think it's also because we've bought the ideological claptrap of the "free market" being separate from and superior to government.
And since private property and freedom of contract are the core of the free market, we assume drug companies have every right to charge what they want for the property they sell.
Yet in reality the "free market" can't be separated from government because government determines the rules of the game.
It determines, for example, what can be patented and for how long, what side payoffs create unlawful conflicts of interest, what basic research should be subsidized, and when government can negotiate low prices.
The critical question is not whether government should play a role in the market. Without such government decisions there would be no market, and no new drugs.
The issue is how government organizes the market. So long as big drug makers have a disproportionate say in these decisions, the rest of us pay through the nose.

Why I Dropped Out of College and What Happened NextAt the end of my freshmen year I dropped out of college.
It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
It all started in 2004. I had just graduated from high school and I was looking forward to going to college. Like millions of other kids I was pursuing a degree in business and marketing. Also, like other kids I had no idea what I was going to do with my life, but I knew that business and marketing would somehow fit into my overall life plan.
In the fall of 2005 I began to notice that things were changing, in business, education and in the economy. It wasn't something that was widely discussed in the media or amongst the general public, but I felt it.
High speed wireless Internet (DSL) had just gone mainstream and eCommerce was beginning to be adopted by the masses. This opened up a world of opportunity for entrepreneurs. No longer did you have to get a loan and set up a brick and mortar shop to start and run a business.
In-between school and work I began teaching myself web design and online marketing.
Through the course of the next 9 years I would continue to perfect my skills and build upon new ones as new trends in business and marketing evolved.
This process of identifying new skills and adding them to my repertoire would serve as a master plan for success.
Despite not having a college degree, my method of higher education has allowed me to obtain endless business and job opportunities, even during The Great Recession. I've worked for Fortune 100 businesses and have achieved success as an entrepreneur, proving that a college degree is no longer as necessary as it once was to achieve success.
My story represents a dramatic culture shift in higher education, the value (or lack thereof) it has with employers in this day and age, and the lens we look through when defining education.
Before I go any further, it's important to emphasize that many professions still require a college degree. I don't know about you but I do not want my doctor to be self-taught.
As it pertains to the value of a college degree to employers, there is still tremendous value, but it only gets your foot in the door. It only gives you the opportunity to get a glance at your resume' amongst the pile of other suitable applicants.
The issue with college graduates is that they're trained to think inside of a box. This is proven by the rigid architecture in our entire education system that forces students to take certain courses that most will never apply in their life or in their careers, ie. Physics, Calculus, Algebra, Geometry etc.
Instead of focusing on a child's aptitude at an early age and pushing them toward a career path with courses that are tailor-made for their future careers, we push a 1,000 year-old anecdotal non-sense belief-system that encourages students to waste time taking courses to become more "well-rounded."
Well-rounded no longer works and it's the reason why Millennials are unemployed, underemployed and headed for disaster.
Businesses no longer have any desire or need for well-rounded employees. The world moves too fast nowadays. What businesses need are people with a very specialized skill-set and this is where college has failed us.
A college education, depending on your major never provides a student with a specialized skill-set. College also never informs students that graduation isn't the end, but only the beginning. It's where your true education starts, because in the real world we live in today, you will have to learn and re-learn new skills to maintain a job every six months to a year. As time marches forward, this timeframe will narrow even further.
Given the new reality of the real world, the question then becomes, "how do you get a job when a degree no longer has the value it once did?"
The answer is simple. You must create a job. Reach out to businesses and offer to work for free to establish your resume'. Line up as many businesses as you can with the intent of working your butt off so you can get great reference letters. Do this for 1 - 2 years and you'll be swimming in job opportunities.
If you're wondering how you're going to find time to work for free and pay your bills, this answer is also simple. Move in with your parents, downsize your lifestyle, watch less tv and work on the weekends. That's what I did. No one ever said success would come easy.
As I analyze my life thus far and my successes, I'm driven to tell my story to others because I'm no better than anybody else.
My successes haven't come as a result of luck. They came as a result of a well-architectured yet simple plan.
I know without a shadow of a doubt that my story can be duplicated. Rather you graduate from college, drop-out of college or choose not to attend at all, what's important is understanding the true definition of education, as this word has been hi-jacked by the institutions of so-called higher learning.
An education and a higher education more specifically isn't rooted in attended a college university. Education has evolved. An education is simply the way you go about perfecting your skills and knowledge for your career.
There are many paths to an education. Choose wisely.

5 Things You Need to Know to Put Your Strengths to Workreddit
Do you have a chance to do what you do best each day at work?  You know, to use your strengths - those things you're good at and actually enjoy doing.
When I was first asked this question several years ago I thought it was trick.  Surely the most important part of my job was to fix my weaknesses, not to build on my strengths.  And when I looked back over the performance reviews written by my bosses, it was clear that this is where they wanted me to focus.
Yet despite many of us believing we grow most in our areas of weaknesses, brain studies reveal we grow the most new synapses in those areas where we have the most pre-existing synapses.  This is why building on our strengths has been found to help us be more engaged, more energized and more productive at work.
Willing to try any evidenced-based idea that would boost my performance, I rushed out and completed two of the most popular strengths surveys - StrengthsFinder and the VIA Survey - and basked happily in my results.  After all discovering what we're good at makes a nice change from the constant flaw spotting our brains are hard-wired for.
As the glow of this good news faded however, I realized these surveys left me with more questions than answers.  The most important being: How exactly was I meant to develop these strengths at work?
After extensively reviewing the research on strengths these are the five things I believe you must know if you hope to put your strengths to work:
Know what your strengths are - It's estimated two-thirds of us have no idea what our strengths are.  If you can't name your top five strengths, using one of the tested surveys is definitely the easiest way to start.  Having trained thousands of people around the world in their strengths, I recommend the free VIA Survey for discovering how you like to work (these are the character strengths that intrinsically motivate you) and StrengthsFinder for discovering what you like to do at work (these are the talents that extrinsically motivate you).
Know how your strengths are valued - A generic definition of a character strength like "love" or a talent like "woo" is of limited benefit.  You need to discover how these strengths can be used in your job and in your organization so they'll be respected, valued and appreciated.  This is easily revealed by thinking back on the high-point moments you've experienced at work - those times when you were really engaged, energized and enjoying what you were doing - and noticing which of your strengths you were using. I guarantee one, or more, of your strengths will be present in these moments.  This simple act of reminiscing gives you a clear guide as to how you're already using your strengths effectively.
Know when you're overplaying your strengths - Every strength has what researchers call a "shadow side " that can get us into trouble when our passion and excitement causes us to over do things.  For example, when we overplay a strength like hope we can see so many opportunities to make great things happen and ways to achieve this that we tend to over-extend and over-commit ourselves. You may even find many of the "weaknesses" your boss has asked you to improve, are actually strengths you're overplaying and just need to dial down. Be mindful of where your strengths are creating difficulties for you at work and start to explore ways you can dial them up or dial them down in different situations to create the outcomes you want.
Know what your strength-fueled future looks like - Positive images have been found to pull us forward into positive actions, so it's worth taking a moment to consider what the year ahead might look like if you could effectively use your strengths more at work.  Try journaling an unedited stream of consciousness that vividly captures what you might achieve over the next 12 months if everything in your job went as well as possible and you could consistently draw on your strengths each day.  What would you be doing and which of your strengths would you be using?  How would your boss or your colleagues describe your performance? What would it feel like to go to work and come home each day?  Spend 15-20 minutes, for at least three days in a row, getting clear on what your strength-fueled future looks like.
Know how to use your strengths each day - Most big changes occur as a result of small, regular efforts.  I found even using my strengths for just ten-minutes a day was enough to turn a job I loathed into a job I liked.  Best of all the chance for others to consistently see me performing at my best, was also enough to eventually see me promoted to a job that was much better suited to my strengths (and paid more!).  Try creating a daily strength habit to get your workday started. Grab this free e-book for more than 70 different strength-development habits you can create in just 11-minutes.
What could you achieve if you focused more on using your strengths at work each day?

electricity production and distribution
India needs a meaningful electricity service, not merely a wire connection to every household
No one would believe that simply owning a smart phone would be enough to go online and get connected — one would still need a data connection for that to happen. Similarly, it is time that we added a similar level of service to define electrification, a focus area for the government.
A decade ago, a village was deemed electrified if it had a single light bulb connection. Subsequently, the definition was upgraded requiring at least ten per cent of homes to be electrified including all common or public areas such as schools and clinics. Based on this definition, the flagship Central government programme Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) electrified over 18,000 villages annually for several years, leaving out only some five per cent remote and distant villages which were being targeted for off-grid (decentralised) electrification.
However, the 2011 Census showed that if we considered household-level data, only 55.3 per cent of rural homes used electricity as the primary source for lighting. The figures were lower for houses with a wire as per National Sample Survey data. This presents two problems before us. First, is the household electrified? More importantly, is there power when needed? A question in the FAQs (frequently asked questions) section of the RGGVY website explains this problem better: “My village has been electrified but there is no electricity, how could RGGVY help?” The answer to this goes thus: “Ensuring supply of power is the responsibility of the concerned State power utility. RGGVY does not have any role to play in this regard. Concerned power utility may be approached for the same.”
Perils of load-shedding
Load-shedding — the bane of India’s power supply system — is far worse in rural areas than metros or large cities. There are regular reports in newspapers of 15 hours of load-shedding in some areas. Until there is power supply available in villages, a household isn’t meaningfully electrified, though it may have a line laid out.
Load-shedding is meant to handle a shortfall of electricity where supply is less than demand, inclusive of losses. An entire feeder is switched off for some time. This includes typically hundreds, if not thousands, of homes or consumers. In theory, there is meant to be a schedule for load-shedding, but many areas also face unscheduled load-shedding. Rural areas face an additional challenge in the supply schedule due to the use of irrigation pump sets, which are heavily subsidised and need three-phase power supply. To ensure households get supply during periods of need, most States only give the so-called single-phase supply during the evening (6-10 p.m.) — good for households but not for most pump sets.
Regulators aim to limit load-shedding, but targets are often violated, both by way of scheduled and unscheduled outages. Worse, we really don’t know the true picture since most States don’t report per feeder load-shedding, breaking it down to hourly or half-hourly data. Load-shedding actions are taken manually at the substation level so there is limited data. Karnataka is an exception here with a real-time monitoring system for every feeder. Analysing per minute feeder data across most of the State, we have verified the reality of very high rural load-shedding across multiple seasons. This is, effectively, a cross-subsidy from rural homes to urban homes. We believe this is not atypical, and most States are similar; some worse, some better, notably Gujarat.
Meaningful electrification
While we need and might even have a wire to the home as a first step, the first threshold for electrification should be at least 50 per cent of homes in a coverage area (i.e., the majority). More importantly, we should add actual service provision, including no load-shedding, to the definition of meaningful electrification. Given our supply shortfall which will take years to resolve, we could start by demanding, say, 98 per cent supply during the peak hours of 6-10 p.m. and 6:30-8:30 a.m., allowing a small buffer for unexpected shortfall in supply. If this isn’t met, then the feeder, which covers more than a village typically isn’t meaningfully electrified.
With such a norm in place, utilities will have to do a better job of managing shortfall, including monitoring where and when load-shedding occurs. When unavoidable, utilities must stick to a transparent, equitable and well-advertised schedule for load-shedding. Unscheduled load-shedding should be penalised. Finally, for household-centric basic supply provisioning, during the evening peak, utilities may need to procure additional peak supply from generators, which will raise overall costs slightly.
Gujarat, an exception
There is a proposed scheme of feeder segregation in rural areas to separate households from pump set supply, allowing them uninterrupted supply. This was originally implemented successfully in Gujarat, and now by the national-level Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Feeder Segregation programme. However, there are a few reasons to be cautious of taking the practice to the national level, since other States have tried similar programmes with varying levels of success. State-to-State variations were recently documented in a major World Bank report apart from other studies. Feeder segregation will only help the evening peak to the extent of avoiding unwanted pump set loads on single-phase supply through phase converters. This is only a small fraction since most pumps are already segregated as per phase supply. Most States have a large deficit, with the exception of Gujarat. Also, the consumer profile in Gujarat is different from many other States, amenable to rural non-pump set loads. Lastly, any scheme requires political will for enforcement and consumer trust in the utilities or the government, which again varies from State to State.
Feeder segregation should be taken up in parts, applying viability analysis to choose deployments instead of blanket roll-outs. Thinking of the future, instead of just differentiation of households from pump sets — which can be done in the most part in phases — it would be better if we think of the next level of transformation and put in place smart meters to differentiate one consumer from another. With such a scheme in place, not only can we give a minimum threshold, but also a lifeline supply of electricity to all consumers, including during shortfall. We can also easily give socially important users such as schools and clinics 24*7 power supply. This is before the many other benefits of a smart grid.
The earlier view of electricity as a commodity at a fixed price is changing, as we now recognise that not all units of power are equal — the time of day, location, and even source (fuel) impact its cost, price and value. The most valuable energy for a household is the first unit of power, invariably used for lighting and charging a mobile phone. Thus, we need meaningful electricity service, not merely a wire connection to every household.

In launching helicopter airstrikes in Iraq  the U.S. boosts the threat its troops faceBy Dan Lamothe October 6 Follow @danlamothe

The United States has expanded its air war against the Islamic State, hitting the militant group for the first time with airstrikes launched from U.S. helicopters. Doing so will likely improve the Pentagon’s ability to help Iraqi forces on the ground, especially against mobile targets — but it also greatly increases the risks Americans will face.
The first American helicopter strikes against the militants were announced Sunday. Officials with U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, said that U.S. troops had launched three airstrikes in Syria and six in Iraq. Four of the strikes in Iraq occurred northeast of the western city of Fallujah, while one occurred southeast of Hit and another was carried out northeast of Sinjar.
U.S. officials announced Monday that three more airstrikes had been carried out in both Iraq and Syria, and that the operations in Iraq included “rotary wing” aircraft along with fighter jets and bombers that have been involved in the campaign for weeks. The helicopters were flown by the U.S. Army, said Maj. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command.
U.S. military officials declined to specify the kind of helicopters used, but they are likely AH-64 Apaches operated by the U.S. Army out of Baghdad International Airport. They carry a variety of weapons, including Hellfire missiles and 30mm cannons. Pentagon officials said early in July that some would be sent to Iraq as the United States expanded the scope of its military mission there, but had not previously disclosed their involvement in any airstrikes.
The use of helicopters will help hit mobile targets like armed trucks or ground troops, said Chris Harmer, a retired Navy helicopter pilot who is now an analyst with the Institute for the Study of War. Fighter jets and bombers are effective hitting fixed targets, but their pilots will struggle against moving targets without someone on the ground who can provide targeting information, he said.
“The more lively the fight is, the more likely you are to need rotary wing aircraft to assist forces on the ground,” Harmer said.
Using Apaches introduces considerably more risk to the U.S. troops involved, however. While fighter jets and bombers might have to contend with mechanical malfunctions, they can operate in Iraq unimpeded by rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons that can be used to target low-flying aircraft. Helicopters have been shot down over Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia in the last 25 years.
The Islamic State is believed to have confiscated powerful surface-to-air missiles known as MANPADS from the Syrian military after capturing an airfield there in August. While both RPGs and MANPADS — short for Man Portable Air Defense Systems — have been used to down American helicopters, many MANPADS are designed to home in on the heat from an aircraft’s engine, making them more accurate than common RPGs, which are unguided.

What is Marburg  the Ebola-like virus that killed a health-care worker in UgandaBy Abby Ohlheiser October 7 Follow @abbyohlheiser
Marburg virus is closely related to Ebola. (C. Bickel/Science Translational Medicine)
A 30-year-old hospital technician died of the Marburg virus this weekend in Uganda, health officials there announced Sunday . Marburg, like Ebola, is a hemorrhagic fever. It's rare but severe.
According to NBC 's Monday report, officials in Uganda have quarantined about 80 people who came into contact with the victim, one of whom — the man's brother — has developed the early symptoms of the disease. Sixty of those quarantined are health-care workers.
On Tuesday, Uganda's Ministry of Health said in an emailed statement that testing on 11 potential cases of Marburg came back negative, including that of the victim's brother. Those who still show symptoms similar to Marburg three days from now will be re-tested at that time, the ministry added.
As with Ebola, there is no cure for the virus. And like Ebola, Marburg can have a high death rate for those infected. That's leading many to wonder whether the Marburg case will begin yet another deadly outbreak of a terrifying disease in Africa, even though the bulk of the evidence suggests otherwise.
What is Marburg — and what are the symptoms?
Ebola and Marburg are the exclusive members of the Filovirus family of hemorrhagic fevers.
Marburg has an incubation period of five to 10 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After that, infected individuals can develop a severe headache, myalgia, a fever and chills. Like Ebola, those initial symptoms are similar to many other diseases, including malaria.
After a few days, the symptoms worsen. They can include nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea and a rash. Eventually, severe cases progress to "jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging and multi-organ dysfunction," the CDC explains.
There's a huge range in the disease's fatality rate in previous outbreaks, from 23 percent to 90 percent.
How do you catch it?
Marbug, like Ebola, is not an airborne virus. The disease is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues or bodily fluids of an infected person or, as has happened in many cases before, an infected primate or fruit bat.
Although Marburg seems to have its origin in and around Uganda, the first outbreak was actually in Europe: In 1967, laboratory workers in Germany and what was then Yugoslavia fell ill after handling African green monkeys imported from Uganda. There were 31 reported human cases and seven deaths, according to the CDC.
Other outbreaks have originated with travelers who visited caves inhabited by likely vectors of the disease, like the Kitum Cave in Mount Elgon National Park in Kenya. It's believed that fruit bat guano is responsible for passing the disease along to humans in multiple instances.
In 1998, a larger-scale outbreak of Marburg infected 154 people, killing 128. Most of those infected were young males working in a gold mine there, according to the CDC . Another large outbreak in Angola infected 252 people and killed 227 in 2004.
Once a human catches the disease from an animal vector, it spreads person to person through direct contact. Often, as with Ebola, the people who care for human victims of Marburg are at the highest risk of becoming infected themselves.
What's the treatment?
There is no specific treatment for Marburg, nor is there a proven vaccine or cure. Hospitalized patients should receive "general supportive therapy," the World Health Organization notes. That includes treating any complicating infections, balancing fluids and electrolytes and replacing any blood loss.
Because of Marburg's close relation to Ebola, there are experimental treatments being developed by some of the same companies working on Ebola drugs. Tekmira pharmaceutical announced that it had tested a drug on lab monkeys infected with a particularly deadly strain of Marburg. Many of the animals treated with the drug, even after the onset of symptoms, recovered, according to Reuters .
Tekmira makes TKM-Ebola , one of a handful of experimental Ebola treatments used on Americans who caught Ebola in West Africa.
Will the Marburg virus be at the center of the next terrifying outbreak?
We can't predict the future, but this seems extremely unlikely. Uganda has experienced previous outbreaks of both Ebola and Marburg and controlled them. Here's what the country's prime minister had to say about the potential for a large-scale outbreak in his country after the Marburg victim died:
Marburg is a Viral Hemorrhagic fever caused by the Marburg virus. MOH has put in place rigorous surveillance & disease control measures
— Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda (@RuhakanaR) October 5, 2014
Uganda has previously successfully handled similar situations of health threats involving Hemorrhagic fevers #Marbugdisease #Ebola
— Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda (@RuhakanaR) October 5, 2014
Uganda has experience and adequate capacity to deal with this health threat & World Health Organisation has been informed #Marburgdisease — Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda (@RuhakanaR) October 5, 2014
Ruhakana Rugunda, who became prime minister in 2014, is a physician who used to serve as the country's health minister.
According to the CDC, the most recent Marburg outbreak in Uganda infected 15 people and killed four. The outbreak lasted three weeks.
Although Marburg is deadly, it is not particularly easy to catch. If an outbreak is identified early and controlled, it is unlikely to escalate the way the current Ebola outbreak has in West Africa.

The Immaturity and Arrogance of Uberreddit
Last week, I wrote about an article here for Medium entitled "Can We Trust Uber?" in which I described a ridiculous incident a couple of years ago where the company used what I thought was my private Uber location data without my permission to promote its brand at one of the company's launch events.
That article went viral and I received dozens of notes in response -- from many "thought leaders" to everyday customers -- all of whom expressed their disbelief and shock. Several people in the media asked if the company had offered a response or apologized? Uber leadership had not, and so on the advice of Medium Editor Steven Levy, I sent the following email five days ago to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and cc'd Garrett Camp, a co-founder and chairman of the company:
Dear Travis,
I hope that this finds you, and that you had a good weekend.
I'm emailing you to follow up on the below piece that I wrote at the suggestion of a few people, including Aaron Blackledge, who suggested that the incident described below was likely a mixup, and suggested that I connect with you and Garrett. This was also the suggestion of Medium editor Steven Levy. I can believe that would be the case, and would be very open to a brief chat with you to clear it up. I'd also be very open to publishing a follow up with Medium.
I'm traveling for a friend's memorial service early this week, but if you're available, I could come by Uber SF this Wed. afternoon or Thursday or Friday. Or we could speak by phone if that'd be easier.
Thanks for letting me know.
cheers,
peter
I have not heard back from Kalanick, nor did I hear from Camp. (I've also asked Uber's media relations team for comment.)
Perhaps Kalanick is too busy to respond to such concerns, but at this point, after getting a great deal of feedback about the operations of the company over the past week, I've come to believe that Uber is in a very precarious position right now.
Uber leadership not only consistently acts as if it is not only above the law, they act as if they are above everyone and every ethical norm.
I'm not here to write an article about Travis Kalanick and his management philosophy. Business Insider already did that in an article entitled: " All Hail The Uber Man! How Sharp-Elbowed Salesman Travis Kalanick Became Silicon Valley's Newest Star ." The title nearly speaks for itself, although I will also include a key passage here:
Acquaintances seem to be of two minds about him: On the one hand, many agreed he is a phenomenon. "Travis is smart," says Kalanick's former investor Mark Cuban. "Busts his ass and is a true entrepreneur. Can't be much more complimentary than that."
Equally common was the view of Kalanick as -- in a word that came up again and again in interviews, "an asshole."
Or as one entrepreneur who has worked with him puts it, "Travis is ego personified."
Often, those impressions overlap.
"Sometimes," an acquaintance of Kalanick's told Business Insider, "assholes create great businesses."
Perhaps Kalanick is the next Larry Ellison, but far more often than not, assholes run businesses into the ground. As someone who has appreciated many aspects of Uber's product and service, including the convenience and the fact that the business model is challenging a stale status quo, I now hope that the Uber board will show some leadership at this time.
Uber suffers from a paradoxical challenge. Its leadership is clearly smart and strategic as hell, yet at the same time, the company's culture reeks of immaturity and a lack of ethics.
At this point in time, the company that Uber reminds me of the most is Groupon three or so years ago. At that time, Groupon was on top of the world. In 2011, as Groupon's IPO approached, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company would be worth up to $25 billion . But thanks to voice of reason in Silicon Valley, most notably Vivek Wadhwa who called the IPO a "scam," the IPO valuation landed at $12.65 billion .
I joined Wadhwa in voicing the belief that Groupon was over-hyped. The reason I did that was in part because of accounting gimmicks, yet also because I had seen Groupon CEO and founder Andrew Mason at events, and judged him to be very immature.
Groupon's atrocious and immature leadership took the company down with it. Today, Groupon's valuation stands at $4.4 billion. But, while many investors lost their shirts on the company, what's worse are the countless employees and stakeholders who suffered from the exodus after an awful morale set in.
Wadhwa was right. Had only Groupon's board listened to him and cleaned things up, the result could have been much different. It's not too late for Uber's board.
The canary in the coal mine has been singing about Uber's immaturity and arrogance for months. The most interesting comment I received on last week's article came from an Uber driver who described the math for how Uber makes promises to drivers, then cuts back fares without any regard for drivers . They aren't employees, so why should Uber management care. As Kevin Roose described in a masterful article for New York Magazine, "Silicon Valley's Contract Worker Problem" , contract workers have no voice.
So, while Kalanick and company enrich themselves, the joke is on everyone else. An arrogance and tone-deafness comes through in everything I see from the company, including its recent announcement pitching teachers to drive on Uber part-time. Several teachers emailed me in disbelief. Here's an excerpt, presented as Uber doing good for the world:
As communities are heading back to school, we'd like to take a moment to celebrate the educators who are also our Uber partner drivers. Whether it's an afternoon shift or a summertime gig, partnering with Uber provides teachers with the flexibility and opportunity they need to continue creating a foundation of excellence for students across the country.
Every day teachers are asked to do more with less, constantly faced with new challenges and limited resources. Uber opens the door for more possibilities and delivers a meaningful impact to the communities we serve.
What a bunch of bullshit. Who do they think will fall for this nonsense?
I don't expect that Travis Kalanick will ever apologize to me for using my Uber location data to promote his brand at a launch event without my permission, but I haven't given up hope in the Uber board's ability to step up and lead. (There are no women on Uber's board, by the way.) Bill Gurley of Benchmark is a respected guy in Silicon Valley, especially for his analytical mind. David Bonderman co-founder of TPG Capital has been a buyout king. David Drummond has impressed me from afar as the chief legal voice at Google. And, as I wrote last week, Garrett Camp, co-founder and now chairman of Uber, once impressed me with his product savvy. Now he must lead.
Now is the time to act, before Uber disappoints the public markets at the IPO and after.

Discovering My Inner Sam MaloneIs this what you see when you look in the mirror?

Not long into our conversation, Kirk Struble has me feeling disillusioned. That is probably for the best.
For many years I have often fantasized about opening a bar. Sometimes the dream has shape-shifted into a Jewish deli or a music club, but more often than not, it’s a watering hole—a no-frills, low-lit space with a solid jukebox and a respectable variety of beer where I could preside in the great tradition of American tavern owners. This bar that sits in my mind’s eye is not especially unique, except that it is mine.
Jordan Weissmann
Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.
My guess is that many other men indulge in the same daydream. This hunch is based purely on anecdote: conversations with friends, some snap polling on Facebook, etc. When I brought the subject up in an editorial meeting, for instance, my colleague Will Oremus nodded knowingly. When Will lived in San Francisco, he even had a corner picked out for his imaginary establishment—Fourth Street and King. He would have called his bar The King.

Which brings me back to Struble. In 2006 he and a partner opened 4th Avenue Pub, one of my favorite bars in Brooklyn. Since then, they’ve expanded with four more establishments, including two in Manhattan—all neighborhoody spots with thoughtful beer lists. I had called him up to learn a bit about the day-to-day of bar-owning life and to see if my dream could survive a conversation with reality.
What would he tell a friend who was considering getting into the business? “I would tell them, ‘I hope you like being in the basement a lot, because more often than not, that’s where I find myself,’ ” Struble says. “I’m the guy schlepping kegs and unclogging toilets.”

Oh? “So many people I know have a glorified idea of Oh, you’re standing behind the bar and there are so many girls. That’s the fantasy. It’s not the reality,” he says. “If I knew the occupation I would have now during college, I would have gone to refrigeration school or plumbing. I would not have gotten a master’s in education.”
Plenty of us sometimes wish we’d picked another major, but what else do bar owners mess up? “Make sure you are able to get a long-term lease,” Struble says. “You can be the most successful place in the world, but if your landlord decides in three years that he’s going to double your rent, are you going to be able to cover it? It’s not sexy, but I’ve seen people flame out.”
Little about owning a bar, it seems, is very sexy. This should be obvious, since you’re running a highly regulated gathering place for drunk people. In major cities, the process for obtaining a liquor license can be a bureaucratic morass that requires convincing the ornery NIMBY-thinkers of your local community board that you are not planning to open a den of iniquity that will lure ravening alcoholics to the neighborhood. And as any fan of Bar Rescue will tell you, plenty of establishments fail simply due to bad bookkeeping. Selling beer takes accounting chops and, worst of all, spreadsheets.
One big problem for inexperienced owners is that they can be “held captive” by their employees.
And yet, plenty of people persevere. “There are a lot of people who have that Sam Malone in them,” says Ryan Clark, director of sales at the Veld Group, a brokerage and consulting firm based in Los Angeles that helps customers buy and sell bars and restaurants. “Whether they’re a doctor or a corporate attorney, they have this thing about owning their own bar.”
Like with any small business, the cost of a bar can vary greatly from city to city and neighborhood to neighborhood, depending on factors like local rent, competition, the customer base, and the availability of liquor licenses. Clark says that Veld has sold many for between $400,000 and $800,000. The most expensive was about $1.2 million—and that only included the business, not the actual building.
(Continued from Page 1 )
But they can come cheaper. According to Clark, in L.A. it usually takes about $150,000 to $200,000 to buy a basic mom-and-pop tavern—think of a 1,500-square-foot space with pool tables—that’s already generating a reasonable profit. “You would probably have to spend twice that amount and a year of your life to go build that on your own,” he says. Buying is also easier than building because it’s often simpler and cheaper to transfer an old liquor license to a different owner than to obtain a new one altogether.
Not that I have $200,000 to spare, but this all seemed mildly encouraging. To put that upfront cost in perspective, Entrepreneur estimates that starting a Subway franchise requires an initial investment of $116,600 to $263,150. And nobody dreams of standing behind a stack of cold cuts.
Are there any kinds of people who simply shouldn’t try to buy and run their own bar? Sure, Clark told me: people who don’t like being surrounded by drinkers.
Heather and Andy Dismore have a more cautious perspective. The husband-and-wife team run ADI Consulting, which helps corporate clients open bars and restaurants. (Heather is also the co-author of Running a Bar for Dummies .) If you’ve never worked in the hospitality business, they tell me, diving in as an owner is a good, and expensive, way to fail at it.   
“When I hear people say, ‘Oh, we can start a place and it will be wonderful, and we’ll bring all our friends and be the center of attention,’ I have two responses,” Andy says. “One is that I can introduce them to the pleasures of cleaning out a grease trap at 3 in the morning. Or they can give me $20,000 upfront, I can kick them in the balls, and they’ll thank me in a year.”
One of the big problems for inexperienced owners, he says, is that they can be “held captive” by their employees. Bartenders and managers have a habit of giving food and drinks away to friends and regulars, which encourages gracious tipping. They pour out stiff drinks. They hand out shots on the house. And if the staff knows the business better than the owner, they can fudge the inventory numbers and hide what they’re doing. “If you haven’t worked in the industry, most people have no idea how to track all this properly,” Andy says.
OK. But what if you pull the full Sam Malone and work as your own bartender? “If you’re stuck behind a bar, what are you not doing?” he asks. “Are you doing the marketing? Are you interfacing with guests? You’re either working in the business, or you’re working on the business—and owners need to be working on the business.”
When people ask her seriously about the idea of buying or starting their own place, Heather Dismore tells them to get a job managing somebody else’s first, to learn the industry and figure out if they actually enjoy the lifestyle. “You’re basically experimenting with someone else’s money,” Dismore says. Managing a bar is a 50-to-80-hour-per-week job, but “when you own your own place, it’s much closer to 95 or 100.”

To be fair, some of that time includes the pleasant labor of sampling beers and deciding what goes on tap. But much of it is plain old office work.
“I’m a total dork,” says Ben Wiley. “I like inventorying. I like sales charts and graphs.” Which is part of the reason he and his brother Mike have been successful with their own family of Brooklyn drinking spots, including Bar Great Harry and the Owl Farm. It takes meticulousness to make sure bartenders aren’t giving away too much free booze, or that cash isn’t mysteriously disappearing from the register.
It also does help to stay sober. “If you drink, don’t drink in your own bar,” Wiley tells me. Thankfully, I doubt I’ll ever have to worry about making that mistake.

Hilton to sell Waldorf Astoria to Chinese investors for $1.95BBy Jonathan O'Connell October 6 Follow @OConnellPostBiz

Hilton Worldwide may be rapidly growing its Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts line of luxury hotels but it is selling the flagship location for which the chain was named.
McLean-based Hilton announced Monday that it plans to sell the Waldorf Astoria New York, comprised of a city block on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, to Anbang Insurance Group Co., a Chinese insurance firm, for $1.95 billion.
As part of the deal, Hilton agreed to continue operating the Art Deco hotel for the next 100 years.
Arlington native  Christopher J. Nassetta , president and chief executive of Hilton, said in a press release that the agreement would “ensure that the Waldorf Astoria New York represents the brand’s world-class standards for generations to come.”
“This relationship represents a unique opportunity for our organizations to work together to finally maximize the full value of this iconic asset on a full city block in midtown Manhattan,” he said.
Waldorf Astoria was the tallest and largest hotel in the world when it opened at its current location, in 1931, according to the company. President Herbert Hoover heralded its opening on a radio broadcast from the White House. Conrad Hilton, founder of Hilton Hotels, began managing it in 1949 and purchased the property in 1972.
In 2006, Hilton moved to leverage the Waldorf’s famous name by launching a chain of higher-end hotels under Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, beginning with four properties including the New York flagship.
The line now totals 27 properties, including hotels in Amsterdam, Beijing and Dubai. Nine other locations are in the works, including hotels in Bali, Bangkok and Beverly Hills.
Sale of the 47-story, 1,413 room Waldorf in New York could help fuel that expansion. Rather than delivering proceeds from the sale directly to shareholders, the company announced that it plans to reinvest the capital to purchase other hotel properties, details of which it did not disclose.
“These acquisitions will be finalized and announced at a later date,” the company said in a press release.
Selling the hotel but continuing to operate it puts the property in line with the vast majority of Hilton properties, which it does not own either.
Last year Hilton went public, raising $2.4 billion with its initial public offering. It is the world’s largest publicly traded hotel chain, with 4,200 hotels and more than 690,000 rooms. Among the company’s other brands are Embassy Suites, DoubleTree and Conrad Hotels & Resorts.
Foreign investors have been taking a more aggressive approach to buying top-brand downtown hotels in markets like New York and Washington. Hilton plans to develop one of its Conrad hotels as part of the CityCenter DC complex in downtown D.C. in partnership with developer Hines and a unit of the Qatar Investment Authority.
The Conrad Washington, D.C.  is being designed by Herzog & de Meuron Architekten and construction could begin next year in a anticipation of a 2018 opening.
The sale of the Waldorf Astoria is slated to close on Dec. 31 but could be delayed up to March 31, according to a Hilton public filing.

Court Rejects Appeal On South Carolina RedistrictingSupreme Court Rejects Appeal On South Carolina Redistricting
Posted:

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court has left intact South Carolina's redrawn state house and congressional maps.
The justices on Monday rejected without comment an appeal from black South Carolina voters who wanted the justices to take another look at the state's new lines for state house and congressional districts.
The high court previously upheld the new lines in a 2012 decision. But opponents asked a lower court to set aside that ruling in light of another recent Supreme Court decision that struck down a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.
The lower court found no need to re-examine its previous findings that the state's districts are fair and don't discriminate against racial minorities.

How to Stop Holding Yourself Back From Building a Billion-Dollar Businessreddit
It is true that there are fewer women getting funded and building billion-dollar companies. The numbers are improving, yet we still have a long way to go. The answer to this problem is to start early and to focus on the internal factors causing this imbalance.
"What's holding you back is the thought that something is holding you back." - Ralph Marston
I was raised with four siblings. I am the only one who graduated from high school. I later went on to college to study finance and today, I run a financial advisory firm that helps early-stage companies get funded. The only difference between my siblings and me is I decided to follow a different path. My internal message set me on that path.
Nobody claims being a pioneer is easy but it is always worth it. With each victory, I am able to find strength to climb higher. I fall. I make mistakes. Yet each mistake I make helps me to learn more about myself and to grow. My internal message is that failure is part of the process. I don't worry about failing. I worry about stagnating.
It's Not About My Gender
In my 20's, I worked in technology M&A. I was the only female on my team and the only team member who did not have both a degree in electrical engineering and an MBA. I struggled to keep up with my peers. I constantly complained to friends that I was being treated differently because I was female. Today, I can see that I struggled because I did not have the same knowledge as my team members. My work was not always up to par because I lacked a solid background in technology. This explains why I was treated differently.
When we get honest, we get better. I gain nothing by blaming my gender. When I look at my own deficiencies, I am empowered to improve my skills. I still don't have an electrical engineering degree. I don't code. I don't consider myself to be tech savvy. Yet, I take the time to understand technology well enough to do my work. Nobody is holding me back from learning. Nobody.
Telling Your Financial Story
If you are building a company, you need to understand the numbers. I know that is not always easy to do. A female engineer once said, "When I see a dollar sign in front of a number I panic." Calculus was easy for her, but finance was hard. Her internal message was that finance was difficult.
When you understand how money is coming in and out of your company, you increase your chances of success. If you can understand basic addition and subtraction, you can understand your company's income statement.
Tell Investors What They Want to Hear
When you talk to investors in the language they want to hear, you increase your chances of getting funded. Investors will invest when you show them you know how to make money.
Do you know your revenue metrics? If you are in the retail business, you want to track your sales per square foot (SPSF). A company like Gap will see $300 in SPSF while a company like Warby Parker will see well over $3,000 in SPSF. If you are operating an online business, you want to know your average revenue per user (ARPU). Amazon has $500 in ARPU while Facebook only has $5.
Once you've determined your revenue metrics, you can measure against your peers. Are you outpacing your peer group? If you're not, find out how you can improve your numbers.
Remember: Investors are investing for financial return. They want to know how your company is going to make money and a return.
Taking My Own Medicine
I don't believe building a billion dollar business is easy. In fact, a friend and I recently started a support group called Billionaire Babes. We realized we both needed help in growing our companies. We get together to discuss revenue generation for our respective companies and to hone in on our weaknesses. My goal is to build a billion dollar company in the next five years. In order to do that, I need to work on my internal messaging by rewiring my brain.
If you are not already in a similar group, I strongly suggest you form one. Women have an entirely different internal message about money. We were not raised to think about making money. We were not taught about wealth creation. The good news: Nobody is holding us back from learning. Nobody.

The Unexpected Consequences Of Successreddit
Everybody loves a winner, right? No, unfortunately, not always. In my coaching practice, many executives and entrepreneurs vent their frustrations with the unexpected negative consequences of their success -- such as their anxiety over being able to maintain their winning streak, the fear that they will be set up to fail, and the envy others feel toward them for their good fortune. Turns out that, according to recent research, these kinds of worries aren't just in their heads -- they're very real. Here's a summary of that research, along with suggestions for overcoming these traps.
Don't do victory laps: A recent study shows that people judge expressive winners as arrogant compared to inexpressive winners and are less likely to want to befriend them. Being judged negatively for your success is justifiably an implicit fear. As a result, success can heighten ambivalence, even unconsciously, about winning. What can you do about this? Learn to moderate when and where you express happiness about your success. Share the good news with other successful people. And focus your conversation on other things you are developing when you are succeeding so as not to annoy people. Striking a balance between authentically admitting your happiness and pretending to "not care" is important. We should enjoy the motivation that comes from being successful, rather than sabotaging ourselves when we are inauthentic. For example, Ray, a current client, often smiles in a pleased way when he announces good news to his company or the public, but always focuses on the unconquered path ahead. He avoids fist pumps and overt signs of victory even when he is overjoyed, and reserves this for conversations with select people in his life.
Focus on the value you bring, not on winning per se: Another study found that when people are similar but superior to us in their achievements, our brain's conflict center is activated leading to envy. In addition, when these people fail, our brain's reward center is activated leading to feelings of schadenfreude (pleasure when someone else falls from grace). When we win, we assume that others will feel similarly , as we project our own feelings onto them. This fear may be unconscious or conscious and may disrupt our confidence, causing anxiety about the effect of our success on other people. To counteract this fear of someone else wishing we would fall, focus instead on the value that you bring to the world rather than winning per se. This will help boost your confidence despite this fear. For example, Cathy, a CEO whose meteoric rise to the top left other people gasping, "distracted" people from their shock by focusing on the value that the company brought to the world.
Stay in the "here and now": When we anticipate future reactions from others, this may actually prevent us from achieving or maintaining success, and if we think too much about these reactions, they may prevent us from subsequently adequately controlling our emotions . To manage this consequence of success, stop overthinking the success. Focus on the "here and now." Let go of worrying about the future and rationalizing the past. Obsession with the past can be distracting and is not always helpful. Also, it will prevent you from clearing your mind. The study above shows that when we integrate what we are anticipating into the here-and-now, we are more likely to manage our emotions more effectively. This means enjoying, accepting, and motivating ourselves with our successes. Joe, an entrepreneur, always "recalibrates" after each round of funding by setting new goals and focuses on what he has to execute on now, rather than obsessively trying to "psychologize" his prior victories. He chooses a time to let go and moves on.
Reach higher: Finally, when we are at the summit of our careers, we may become bored to the point that we slow down too much and become disoriented. This is called " the summit syndrome ." To prevent boredom, you have to always be looking for stimulating ways to apply your mastery. When you have mastered something, ask yourself: How you can innovate around this? Watch out for your own boredom as it can lead you to sabotage yourself, and also watch out for reactive lateral shifts in job hierarchy simply to escape your boredom of mastery. Huang, a fund manager, sticks to his investment process within his company and after a streak of major wins, he raises the bar even more for himself and engages in this "reaching."
People often prepare for failure, but rarely prepare for what they will do when they succeed. Even when we consciously want to be successful, enjoying that success can be a challenge. By following the suggestions above, you can create a framework for managing success so that you can more reliably sustain your success when it occurs. If you are conscious about these factors, you will create far more opportunities to sustain your success over time. More importantly though, as a society, we are likely to have more sustained wins if we manage our feelings of envy and schadenfreude. If we do this, we, and those whom we care about, will fully enjoy and savor those winning streaks.

Financier Stan Bril of MCG on Achieving Success from Adversityreddit
I've always believed that out of adversity and poor economic climates can emerge the best and strongest companies and entrepreneurs. I was proved right once again when I sat down with financier Stan Bril, who founded his private lending and investment firm, MCG , at the height of the financial crisis when many thought that the financial industry was toxic.
Stan blocked out the skeptics and the critics, kept his eye on the ball and grew MCG to where it is today, having funded over $250 Million in investment deals and brokered another $1 Billion in deals. Whether it's investing in major real estate transactions, funding large business loans or acquisitions, or financing lines of credit for entrepreneurs, Stan has his hand in many deals at any given time and manages a very demanding schedule. I asked him to share his story on how he did it and his advice for overcoming adversity and still succeeding in any economic climate. I'm sharing his wisdom with you below.
When did you launch MCG?
I was open in March of 2009. We started during the peak of the financial crisis and many people thought I was crazy. 
What was the first deal that you closed at MCG?
We brokered a $30 Million warehouse line of credit for a casino.
What are the most important daily habits for your success?
Personal: Being with and around my family.
Professional: Constantly learning the economy/markets.
How do you manage your time when you are involved in so many deals?
I try my best to give a specific deal just the right amount of time, not too little or too much. This took me a while to get it right, but with the calendar on my phone and reminders, it made it easier with time.
What makes you the most passionate about what you do?
Being able to help people reach their financial goals and help their business. I also want to be the best at what I do.
What was the biggest obstacle you had to overcome in building your company and how did you do it?
The negativity of people around me. I started a financial institution when banks were in need of a bailout and when others were closing down. People were skeptical about the company and how/if it was going to succeed. How did I overcome it? I had to cut those people out of my life.
What is the most important piece of advice you've learned about building a successful company?
Give it your all, everything you have and take baby steps doing it. Starting a company is like walking up a staircase that is as high as a mountain. If you look straight up at the top, you might get discouraged and give up. BUT if you put your head down, work hard and take "one step at a time", you will be 1/2 done before you know it. Being around positive people who encourage your goals/vision also helps.
What is the next goal for MCG?
Continue on the path we are on. Make more loans and make more people money.

After Ringing the IPO Bellreddit
Last week's successful IPO of e-commerce giant Wayfair (market cap $3 billion) and this week's impending IPO of Hubspot (if it prices in the range, market cap $600 million) has many in the Boston tech community celebrating .  They are not alone.  2013 was the best year for IPOs since the tech bubble of the '90s and 2014 looks to wrap up even stronger this quarter.
I was an executive at a hot IPO company during the last big tech boom (NASDAQ: OMKT) and, like many who lived through that cycle, I gleaned a few important lessons. After the IPO party is over (and we had a great IPO party) and the euphoria wears off, you actually have to run a company and live up to the big expectations that you have just publicly set. Your venture capital investors and many early employees head for the door and you are left holding the bag. Here are a few things I learned after my 16 quarters as an executive post-IPO:
1) The Mission Continues.  On average, it takes eight to 10 years for a start-up to go public. After a lot of ups and downs, twists and turns, it feels like a massive victory (aka "Mission Accomplished," as George Bush famously declared regarding Iraq in 2003). By that time, your team will be exhausted. Naturally, a huge let-down ensues, particularly after the first hiccup -- and there will always be a hiccup: a missed quarter, a departing executive or major customer, something. Recruiters and venture capitalists salivate over picking off executives at recently public companies with the siren song of "don't you want to do that again?" If the stock price flags, all the better. Executive teams need to focus their staff post-IPO on a new mission. Be clear that the end goal was never an IPO -- that is merely a financing event, a means to an end.  The end goal is industry transformation, customer satisfaction, etc. Find that new mission -- and make sure you get your team behind it. Give them more stock options, more incentives and more inspiration to go at it hard for another eight to 10 years.
2) Don't Let The Turkeys Get You Down.  When Ronald Reagan left office, he provided a final note with words of wisdom for incoming president George H. W. Bush:  "Don't let the turkeys get you down." And, believe me, when you're a newly public company executive, there are a lot of turkeys out there. Not only is there a risk that your company mood ebbs and flows with the daily stock price (your stock is down 10 percent thanks to Vladimir Putin -- deal with it), but you are suddenly publicly castigated for every move. Investing an extra $1 million in R&D in order to accelerate your game-changing new product? Pre-IPO, your board would have applauded. Post-IPO, you will get hammered. And if any insiders dare to divest of their shares, even in programmed trading batches, it will kill you. I remember delivering a (compelling, I thought) company presentation at a Goldman Sachs conference and, afterwards, the first question was, "Mr. Bussgang, if your company is so great and the future so bright, why is your CEO selling stock?" Many Wall Street analysts are total turkeys. They build their reputation by tearing yours down. Be tenacious and true to your strategy and prepare your team to ignore the noise. Gail Goodman is one of the most tenacious, skilled public company CEOs I know. Many analysts hammered Constant Contact shortly after the IPO, complaining about churn rates and missing the social marketing window. The stock waxed and waned and Gail just kept executing. A few years later, the stock has nearly tripled these last two years and the market cap is near $1 billion. Watch her public presentations over the years and you'll see Gail kept telling the same story -- making small improvements every quarter and showing the turkeys the value of the business. Care.com CEO Sheila Marcelo is in the midst of a similar situation. Her stock is down 3x from its post-IPO high with a market cap of a paltry $250 million. I'm rooting for her to prove the turkeys wrong, just like Gail did, but it requires a tremendous amount of patience and tenacity.
3) Wall Street Is Annoying... But Sometimes Right.  OK, I know this sounds like a contradiction to point two, but it's the unfortunate truth. Wall Street analysts and hedge fund managers can be annoying, short-term minded turkeys, but they're smart and often right. Carl Ichan's recent battle with eBay/PayPal is a great example. The trick is to ignore the noise, but don't walk around with an arrogant attitude that you are always right and the critics are always wrong because they just "don't get it." Make sure you listen carefully to the smart Wall Street analysts and incorporate their feedback where appropriate. Make sure you have board members who make you a little uncomfortable because they hold you accountable. The cozy days of the VC-led board where everyone is trying to blow smoke and get you to help them with their next fund is over. Wall Street doesn't care about a long-term relationship. They demand results. And sometimes their cool, analytical distance can be very valuable. It can be painful and distracting, but sometimes very enlightening and helpful.
Ben Horowitz's book, the Hard Thing About Hard Things , is one of my favorite business books of the year. The best parts, in my opinion, describe Ben's struggles as a public company CEO trying to refocus and motivate his team, make hard pivots and hard decisions, while dealing with internal and external challenges. His case study is precious, because in my experience it plays out again and again and Ben's candor and authenticity allow us to peer into the raw emotions and feelings of riding through those ups and downs. Executives of these newly public companies should take heed. Linger on the champagne for a moment, but then quickly clean up and get everyone focused on what's next.
After the IPO bell has rung is when the hard work really begins.

Nation Surprisingly Aware of Who Janet Yellen IsFed chair John Roberts.
Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images
In its latest News IQ Quiz, Pew Research Center decided to assess what Americans know about the people who set their monetary policy. Specifically, Pew wanted to know how aware Americans are of the person in charge of the people who set their monetary policy. Here's how Pew presented its question:
Screenshot from Pew .
If you answered "Janet Yellen," congratulations! You, wise Moneybox reader, are among the 24 percent of people in our nation who can identify the current Fed chair among four options on a multiple-choice question. Pew reports that 17 percent of people chose Alan Greenspan, 6 percent picked Sonia Sotomayor, and 5 percent opted for John Roberts. Forty-eight percent did not guess on the question.

While 24 percent recognition doesn't exactly say great things about public awareness of the Fed, it's also not terrible, considering that Yellen was only confirmed in January and the Fed itself is notoriously taciturn. When Pew asked a similar question about Ben Bernanke in 2008, it was a full two years into his appointment as Fed chief, and 35 percent of people answered correctly. (The other choices in that quiz were Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker, and Henry Paulson; 27 percent of respondents picked Greenspan.)
Of course, the percentage of people who ID'd the Fed chair correctly would almost certainly have been smaller if Pew hadn't jogged memories with four multiple-choice responses. Case in point: In 2007, Pew found that only 36 percent of people could come up with "Vladimir Putin" when asked to name the president of Russia as an open-ended question. When three choices were given (Putin, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Boris Yeltsin) that figure jumped to 60 percent .

Epilogue: Slam dunk streamingBy Alyssa Rosenberg October 6 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
The blessing and the curse of this moment in media, in which huge amounts of content are moving online to various streaming services, is that this new profusion of large amounts of content to watch sometimes can make us keenly aware of what is not available. This is frustrating, but it is an inevitable result of the transition from the legacy contracts that governed how content was distributed, which cannot just be abandoned because we would like things to be different.

The news today that Disney and Turner Broadcasting have signed new deals with the NBA that allow for the development of a streaming service  that will be available to people who do not subscribe to cable is a good example of what those transitions look like. The old agreement locked down the game rights. Now that those rights are available, time to work on a new technological option and a new business model to reach viewers. Slow and frustrating? Sure. But this is the way to a sustainable new system.
And with that in mind, what sport, movie or television show would you like to see liberated and made available with a streaming deal?

No ban on travelers from West Africa  but additional screenings are comingBy Mark Berman and Brady Dennis October 6 Follow @markberman Follow @brady_dennis
President Obama met with top health, homeland security and national security advisers on Monday to discuss the Ebola outbreak. Obama said some foreign countries are not doing enough to confront the Ebola crisis in West Africa. (AP)
President Obama said Monday the U.S. government would increase passenger screenings in both the United States and Africa to detect the Ebola virus, though he resisted calls to impose a total travel ban on those traveling from the three West African countries most affected by the outbreak .
Neither the president nor White House officials elaborated on what those new screenings would entail. At the moment, passengers leaving the three nations riven by the virus — Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone — are screened for symptoms at the airport.
“The ability of people who are infected who could carry that across borders is something that we have to take extremely seriously,” Obama said Monday afternoon after a meeting with top advisers to discuss Ebola.
The range of new screening possibilities under consideration include everything from taking the temperature of travelers from impacted countries upon their arrival at major U.S. airports to conducting more stringent travel histories for international travelers arriving in the U.S., said a federal official familiar with the discussions, who asked to remain anonymous because plans have not been finalized.
Obama emphasized that the country was prepared to contain Ebola, saying that he felt the odds of an epidemic in the U.S. “are extraordinarily low.”
“In recent months we’ve had thousands of travelers arriving here from West Africa, and so far only one case of Ebola has been diagnosed in the United States, and that’s the patient in Dallas,” he said.
Obama spoke as Thomas Duncan, as a Liberian man stricken with Ebola, remained in critical condition in a Texas hospital. And his remarks came shortly after a nurse in Spain became the first known person to contract the virus outside of Africa.
This woman contracted the virus after caring for a priest who had been flown from Sierra Leone to Spain last month for treatment, Ana Mato, the Spanish health minister, said at a news conference Monday. The nurse’s condition was stable on Monday, and officials were trying to determine exactly how she contracted the illness, Mato said.
During his remarks Monday, the president was sharply critical of other countries that he said have not acted aggressively enough in response to the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,400 people and infected more than twice that number.
“Countries that think that they can sit on the sidelines and just let the United States do it, that will result in a less effective response, a less speedy response, and that means that people die,” he said.
Several Republicans on Monday  called for heightened screenings or complete travel bans , with Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) called for “enhanced screening procedures.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R)  wrote a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration pointing out that the busy holiday season is looming and asked if the agency is planning on limiting or suspending air travel to the countries where Ebola is prevalent.
Perry and Cruz, both potential 2016 presidential candidates, hail from Texas, where last week Duncan became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. The state is also home to international airports in Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio that saw more than 55 million travelers in 2012, according to the Department of Transportation.
This issue has also come up in several key midterm contests in states that are home to some of the country’s busiest airports. Thom Tillis, the Republican nominee for Senate in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, last week called for U.S. officials to ban travel from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. In Michigan, Republican Senate nominee Terri Lynn Land has also called for a travel ban.
North Carolina is home to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, which saw more than 20 million passengers in 2012. Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Michigan saw nearly 16 million passengers the same year.
U.S. airlines said Monday they would meet with federal authorities to discuss what would provide another layer of protection for their passengers. The trade group Airlines for America, which represents most of the major U.S. carriers, said “members that fly to affected countries remain in steady contact with government agencies and health officials, and have procedures in place to monitor and quickly respond to potential health concerns.”
Still, despite the furor, there does not appear to be a guaranteed way to prevent Ebola victims from flying into the U.S. There are, however, time-tested means by which the U.S. weathered two earlier global health scares: The swine flu pandemic in 2009 and the outbreak of severe SARS in 2002 and 2003.
Procedures developed during SARS and swine flu pandemic require flight crews to radio ahead whenever a passenger falls ill. In some cases, a heart attack, for example, the call would be made so that an ambulance could meet the aircraft. But with symptoms specified by the CDC, airlines are required to notify the federal disease control agency before the flight lands.
There are no direct flights by U.S. carriers from the three hard-hit nations: Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, and fewer than half a dozen flights from anywhere in West Africa.The vast majority of travelers from Africa to the U.S. fly through hub cities in Europe. For example, Duncan flew from his native country to Brussels, where he boarded a flight to Dulles International Airport, changed planes and continued on to Dallas.
If a passenger books travel on a single ticket — Liberia to Brussels to the U.S. — tracking by the U.S. Customs and Boarder Protection will reveal the travel originated in Liberia. But any passenger who buys two tickets — Liberia to Brussels, and then Brussels to the U.S. — won’t show up the same way in the Customs data scan.
Airport officials, meanwhile, emphasized Monday that the CDC remains the lead agency for any response to the Ebola outbreak. The CDC maintains full-time offices at Dulles and other major U.S. destinations for international flights and there are quarantine stations at major airports across the country.
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which manages Reagan National and Dulles International airports, said that while there have been no formal discussions, there have been informal conversations regarding procedures in the event a passenger suspected of having Ebola moves through Dulles.
“As this has developed it’s on the forefront of people’s minds,” said Christopher Paolino, a spokesman for the airport authority. “Everyone wants to make sure we are prepared.”
The Federal Aviation Administration has the power to restrict flights by U.S. carriers and, working with the CDC and the White House, could revoke the right of specified foreign carriers to land in the U.S.
“While the FAA has the authority to direct flight operations in United States airspace, any decision to restrict flights between the United States and other countries due to public health and disease concerns would be an interagency decision,” the FAA said in a statement. “The World Health Organization and the CDC have not recommended general travel restrictions to or from the countries affected by Ebola.”
The White House said it was not thinking about banning travelers from West Africa, despite the uneasiness that followed Duncan’s diagnosis and the warnings that other Ebola cases are expected in the U.S.
“A travel ban is something that we’re not currently considering,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Monday. He cited the “multi-layered” screening system currently in place as well as guidance given to flight crews and Customs and Border Patrol officers.
In a sign of how seriously the president is taking the Ebola outbreak, Obama convened virtually all of his top aides — from Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, who is leading the inter-agency coordination effort, to Katie Fallon, the White House director for legislative affairs — to discuss the administration’s response to the outbreak.
Public health officials have resisted a complete travel ban , which they warn would further impact the economies of these countries, hinder the ability to deliver desperately needed food and supplies and even limit the ability of doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers to travel into these areas.
Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Sunday that the agency has increased exit screenings at airports in the Ebola-riddled countries, using a combination of thermometers, questionnaires and “visual inspection” of travelers.
This screening had stopped 77 people from boarding planes, including 17 last month, he said.
However, this system is not foolproof, as is evidenced by Duncan’s diagnosis in the U.S. It relies upon a person filling out a questionnaire honestly and correctly, even though they may not know they had contact with a person with Ebola. A person who has contracted the disease but has not become symptomatic would not have a fever or any visible signs of illness, which means the thermometer and visual check would not help.
Duncan had his temperature taken by a person trained by the CDC using a thermometer approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Frieden said last week. He had no fever and did not display any symptoms until four or five days later.
The hospital treating Duncan, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, said Monday that over the weekend he had begun receiving an experimental treatment for the deadly disease. Known as brincidofovir, the drug is produced by Chimerix, a North Carolina-based biotech firm that describes itself as a developer of “novel, oral antivirals in areas of high unmet medical need.”
Brincidofovir is an antiviral drug developed to treat a range of viruses, including those in the herpes family and adenovirus, which accounts for some acute respiratory infections in children. The company, which also has sought to use the drug as a treatment against smallpox, said it also received permission to offer the drug to Ebola patients from the FDA, which must sign off on the experimental use of unapproved drugs. There currently are no approved treatments or vaccines for Ebola.
Duncan, who remained in critical but stable condition Monday, joins a handful of other Ebola patients who have received experimental drugs during the course of the current outbreak. Two U.S. missionaries infected this summer while working in West Africa were given doses of another unapproved drug, known as ZMapp. But the very limited supplies of that drug were soon exhausted; the San Diego-based company behind it is trying to produce more as quickly as possible. Another experimental medicine by a Canadian company, Tekmira, has been used on another American doctor who was flown to Nebraska from West Africa for treatment.
No one else that had contact with Duncan has showed any symptoms of Ebola, authorities said Monday.

Cleansing Gandhi of radicalismIn the rhetoric that emanated from the prime minister, there was no hint of any of the radical moves Gandhi made.
Written by Suhas Palshikar | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:49 am
By re-discovering Gandhi as only an icon of cleanliness, government has taken the first step towards dismantling his legacy.
As the new regime settles into office, efforts seem to have begun to shape a new thinking process and redefine our national heritage and the idea of our collective being. While the elements associated with the ruling party, but operating outside the government, have enthusiastically and somewhat aggressively started underscoring the change, the government too seems to have taken seriously the mandate that it has to change the face of India’s intellectual personality. At least initially, these efforts seem to have adopted a non-controversial and seemingly consensual tone that can easily keep convincing the pro-development lobby that Narendra Modi assiduously cultivated during the campaign. The prime minister’s televised speech on Teachers’ Day fitted with this approach. The “Clean India” drive too appears to have evoked equally enthusiastic and consensual reactions. And yet, the Gandhi Jayanti programme was a clear indication of the change that is coming.
To understand this change, we need to unravel the puzzle as to how Gandhi, with whom the Hindu nationalists always remained in an adversarial conversation even after his death, suddenly becomes an official icon of the regime based on that same Hindu nationalist ideology. This could happen only by redefining Gandhi. The government has now initiated that process. Only by taking Gandhism away from Gandhi, can “Gandhi” be converted into an icon whose words can be used as official catechism (or, as the “brand ambassador” of a new clean India!). The aggressive cleanliness drive launched by the government on Gandhi Jayanti and the marketing of the new Gandhi need to be seen in this perspective.

Planning ahead for the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi, this drive promises to denude Gandhi of the substantive ideas he was associated with. If this effort goes on for five years, the next generation would remember Gandhi for cleanliness (only). Already, there are many, even today, who are convinced that Gandhi (only) meant cleanliness. That is why, from corporates to spiritual gurus, so many have supported the drive. Suddenly, our corporate giants have learnt from the prime minister that India needs toilets and they are coming forward dutifully to fund the drive. As Modi mentioned in his address to adoring audiences of NRIs at the Madison Square Garden, we need to build an India that “they” (Indians staying/ working in the US) dream of. In direct contrast to Gandhi, who always reminded us that public life and politics need to be anchored to the dreams and expectations of the “last man”, we are striving continued…
The crucial question is about symbolism. In the rhetoric that emanated from the prime minister, there was no hint of any of the radical moves Gandhi made. His penchant for toilet-cleaning had far too radical social implications.

Dont blame MSP for inflationFacts hardly support Surjit Bhalla’s conclusion that inflation in India is entirely driven by changes in the MSP. (Reuters)

Ill-thought-out assertions about the efficacy of monetary policy can unhinge private expectations of inflation.
The Indian Express recently published two articles by Surjit S. Bhalla on the subject of inflation in India (‘Where monetary policy is irrelevant’, September 13 and ‘RBI, we have a problem’, September 20). Bhalla’s central thesis is that inflation in India is primarily driven by changes in the minimum support prices (MSP) for agricultural goods. He then uses this “fact” to argue that, since monetary policy has no effect on inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should lower interest rates to spur growth. However, both his conclusions are problematic.
Let us start with the relationship between the MSP and inflation. Given the large share of food in the consumer price index (CPI), no one can or should argue that increases in the MSP have no inflationary consequences. Rather, the key question to ask is what factors cause the MSP itself to move. While the government possibly takes into account a number of factors in determining the MSP, a key input is clearly inflation itself. Rising overall price levels, without corresponding increases in agricultural prices, implies a loss of real purchasing power for the farmer. Increases in the MSP provide the farmer with insulation against such a loss.
In as much as the MSP itself responds to current and past inflation, a part of the reported effect of the MSP on inflation is then just the effect of past inflation on current inflation, rather than any independent effect of changes in the MSP on inflation. The MSP may well have an independent effect on inflation, but to determine that one needs to break up MSP inflation into two parts: the part that is induced by current and past inflation and the part that is not. The key test then is to see which of these two components of the MSP has the bigger effect on inflation.
Using the CPI (industrial workers) and a weighted MSP index for the period of 1976-2014, I did precisely that exercise. The bottom-line of the results is that, using the part of the MSP due to past inflation to predict inflation does almost as good a job
as using the overall MSP. Moreover, when both components of MSP changes are used to predict inflation, the effect of inflation-induced MSP is three times as high as that of non-inflation MSP. The main implication of this is that the biggest predictor of inflation is past inflation. It is clear that past MSP changes due to inflation account for a much larger part of overall CPI inflation than does non-inflation MSP.
There is an even bigger kick to these results. If one predicts inflation using both components of the MSP, but using continued…
Facts hardly support Surjit Bhalla’s conclusion that inflation in India is entirely driven by changes in the MSP. Consequently, that the RBI has no influence on inflation, does not follow either.

Pakistan in Turkeys mirrorNew York Times | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:32 am
Having helped create the IS, Ankara has reasons to fear a Taliban-like blowback.   
Last week, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, declared that Turkey is ready “for any cooperation in the fight against terrorism.” But Turkey’s dilemma is far more grave than its leaders realise. Indeed, Turkey’s current situation resembles the early years of Pakistan’s sponsorship of the Taliban. The Islamic State is recruiting militants in Turkey. And failure to clean its own house now could lead Turkey down the path of “Pakistanisation,” whereby a resident jihadist infrastructure causes Sunni extremism to ingrain itself deeply within the fabric of society.
Although Turkey now recognises the threat, it has yet to come to terms with its own responsibility for helping to create it. As Francis J. Ricciardone Jr, the former American ambassador to Turkey, has pointed out, Ankara supported radical groups, including the Nusra Front. Indeed, during the early days of Syria’s civil war, jihadist groups funnelled fighters and resources through Turkey into Syria. Turkey’s intervention in the Syrian civil war parallels Pakistan’s support of the Taliban to affect the course of the Afghan civil war. But the jihadism abetted by Pakistan did not remain across the Afghan border. Turkey may now be witnessing the beginnings of a similar blowback. While the magnitude of Turkey’s recent engagement of jihadist proxies isn’t comparable to Pakistan’s long history of jihadist sponsorship, the late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s ill-fated relationship with the Sunni extremists of Pakistan’s Deobandi movement is still instructive for Turkey.
Pakistan’s experience with blowback began prior to Bhutto’s tenure, when General Zia ul-Haq’s regime backed mujahideen militias as proxies to combat Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Organised by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate with assistance from the United States and Saudi Arabia, the recruitment networks within Pakistan started a radicalisation process among segments of Pakistan’s population. In 1994, Bhutto began to abet militancy to secure Pakistani objectives in Afghanistan. The Bhutto government facilitated a paramilitary force of thousands of madrasa students to cross the border and take control of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. With Pakistan’s help, this militia of “Taliban,” literally “students,” conquered large swaths of Afghan territory and declared its commander, Mullah Omar, to be caliph. Their militancy soon crossed the border. After the initial stage of mobilising volunteers and weapons for jihad in Afghanistan, a second phase developed in which Pakistan witnessed a wave of anti-Shiite violence, including bombings of Karachi’s major Shiite mosques by the Taliban’s sister organization in Pakistan, Sipah-e Sahaba.
The Turkish government’s decision to turn a blind eye to IS activity within its borders has similarly led to the continued…

GOP Senate Candidate s Trailer Park Deal Shows  What Conflict Of Interest Is All AboutThom Tillis Trailer Park Deal Shows 'What Conflict Of Interest Is All About'

WASHINGTON -- As he crisscrosses North Carolina campaigning for U.S. Senate, Thom Tillis likes to remind voters of his modest upbringing. The Republican candidate and former business executive describes a childhood with parents who struggled to make ends meet, and "when times got really tough, we lived in a trailer park."
As a newlywed high-school graduate working in a warehouse, he found himself living in a mobile home once more, Tillis recounted recently.
What Tillis fails to mention in the campaign trail rags-to-riches story is that he bought a trailer park in early 2007 -- an investment he hoped would increase in value while providing him rental income. But now, as he presses his run for the Senate, the story of that trailer park may cause voters to question whether Tillis used the trappings of his office as a state legislator for personal gain.
That's because in the months after he bought the trailer park, Tillis introduced state legislation and sought political compromises that likely would have increased the value of his property.
Tillis' Senate campaign noted that he fully complied with the law during the entire process. A spokesman also stressed that Tillis did not advocate for specific bills and, indeed, helped facilitate a public feedback process that ultimately doomed any chance of a bill passing.
But Tillis' involvement in legislation with the potential to affect his personal portfolio complicates Republican attacks against his opponent, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), who has been accused of profiting from federal stimulus funds. That Tillis wasn't forthcoming about his potential conflict at the time -- he would disclose the property a year later when he was required to by law as part of his ethics disclosure forms -- also has raised concerns from government watchdogs.
"The problem is that as Tillis was advocating a bill that would impact his property value, he should have disclosed his ownership," said Bob Hall, executive director of Democracy North Carolina, a good-government advocacy group with a history of calling out both Democrats and Republicans on ethical lapses. Tillis' actions may not have violated North Carolina's lax ethics laws, but Hall said his conduct nevertheless left a bad impression.
"Tillis is a very savvy man when it comes to his financial interests. And that's what 'conflict of interest' is all about," Hall said. "It's about whose financial interests Tillis is serving."
FIXED UP 'GARBAGE'
On the outskirts of Huntersville, in the suburbs north of Charlotte, the mobile home lot at 11826 Ramah Church Road sits directly across from the Abernathy Park baseball diamond on a grassy plot of land dotted with old-growth trees, lending a sense of privacy to the rented trailers.
The entrance to the trailer park at 11826 Ramah Church Road.
On March 14, 2007, it changed ownership. Tillis bought the three-acre lot with 10 mobile homes from a Huntersville Board of Adjustments official named Ron Julian, a well-known real estate developer who owned numerous parcels of land on the eastern fringes of town.
Julian had only owned the property for six months before selling it to Tillis. He had purchased it on Sept. 5, 2006, for $180,000, intending to fix up some of the more neglected homes. "The houses were garbage," Julian told HuffPost in an interview. "I fixed 'em up and made it a nice place to live."
That March, Tillis closed on a $395,000 bid for the trailer park. For Julian, who would be elected Huntersville city commissioner later that year, it was a gain of more than 120 percent in six months.
"I'd never even met Thom Tillis," Julian said, "and it was actually my wife who told me, 'I bet you could sell this property for double the price. ... I guess Thom Tillis just isn't a very savvy real estate investor."
Tillis' campaign said he purchased the property as a long-term investment with the intention of having his brother Rick manage the homes. He did, in fact, have real estate acumen. His wife Susan Tillis was and is a real estate agent.
But Tillis also had political insight.
Tillis began his first term as Huntersville's representative in the state legislature on Jan. 1, 2007. Around that time, an economic boom was changing the demographics of Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte and Huntersville. The success of Charlotte-based Bank of America was transforming the sleepy college town into the second-largest financial capital on the East Coast.
For towns like Huntersville, one way to absorb a rapidly expanding population was by folding county land into the city limits, a process called annexation. In North Carolina, the state legislature could approve a town's request to annex county land, even if citizens objected. Once those properties became part of a town, homeowners stood to benefit from municipal services like police patrols and garbage collection. It also meant properties just inside the town's old borders would increase in value, since they would be surrounded by newly annexed, higher-priced real estate.
As it happened, in the spring of 2007, one of the areas considered by the state legislature for annexation was the land abutting the trailer park that newly elected state representative Thom Tillis had just purchased.
ANNEXATION
It's unclear when Tillis first learned of the annexation plan. Daniel Keylin, a spokesman for Tillis' Senate campaign, said the annexation "process takes years to develop" -- meaning that consideration predated his boss's election to the state legislature.
The first public record of Tillis' knowledge was March 2, 2007. That's when Huntersville Mayor Kim Phillips and City Commissioner Sarah McAuley met with Tillis and another area legislator to come up with "legislation that would annex into the Town of Huntersville the entire sphere of influence that’s not now in the Town limits, both on the east side and the west side" of the town, according to the official minutes of a town board meeting held March 5.
Since his district covered the bulk of the land under consideration, Tillis was given the responsibility to "introduce a bill for us, if we agree to it," McAuley told attendees at the meeting.
Before Tillis introduced the bill in the legislature, the Huntersville city commissioners unveiled the proposal publicly. At a town board meeting on March 5, they announced a hearing on the plan to annex more than 30 square miles of county land and absorb it into Huntersville.
Were the plan to be approved, it would have drastically redrawn the map of Huntersville real estate, turning land that had previously been on the edge of town into centrally located property. Tillis' trailer park had been just blocks within the town limits. The land under consideration for annexation was directly to its east. After decades of being on the outskirts of Huntersville, 11826 Ramah Church Road would be firmly in the town's interior.
BREAKDOWN
On March 28, things grew complicated for the annexation plan. That day, Tillis unveiled House Bill 1133 , the Huntersville Annexation Bill, in the state legislature. It was referred to a legislative committee.
What Tillis filed wasn't the original annexation plan discussed with Huntersville officials. It was a new plan, which called for annexing land only on the eastern side of town. Tillis told the Charlotte Observer that he no longer believed the western area outside Huntersville's boundary should be included. He didn't cite a reason for the change, saying only that "the eastern and western land should be separate issues."

Tillis' trailer park was located on the eastern side of town.
The annexation bill, however, had already morphed into a full-fledged political headache. Voters were angry at what they viewed as a government land grab.
In response, Tillis posted a long and carefully worded notice on his website , reassuring people that just because he had introduced the bill, "does not suggest that the measure will move forward."
On the contrary, he said, "as a condition for filing the bill, I have asked the town to complete due diligence, including public notice through the print media, a mailing to every affected household, and a public hearing on April 12th. My goal is to provide citizens with every opportunity to have their questions answered and to have their concerns heard."
In early April, the debate over annexation grew more heated. During a public forum that Tillis attended, residents railed against the plan.
"The biggest thing that bothers me, is why should anybody else tell us what to do with our land? We pay taxes on all our stuff until the day we die," county resident Calvin Matthews said at that April 12, 2007, forum. "But no one should have the right to tell us what to do with our property."
Tillis tried to appeal to the angry residents. "Generally speaking, when you hear about annexation, it doesn’t sound like a good thing," Tillis said. "And we are going to take that into account [and] figure out if this is the appropriate thing to do at this time."
Public opinion, however, was hardening. When an attendee called for a show of hands on the annexation, not a single hand went up in favor.
That Tillis was asked to introduce the bill and that he opened it up for larger debate, his campaign said, is evidence that he was a shepherd of the annexation process and not an advocate for it.
"Thom Tillis did his job as a state representative by introducing the bill at the request of the city of Huntersville, he followed state statutes, and the record clearly shows he helped open the process up for community input, which eventually led to the annexation process being halted," Keylin said.
The official minutes from that contentious meeting, however, show that as much as Tillis was absorbing concern over the proposal, he attempted to assuage it, going so far as to recount a successful annexation effort in a neighboring town, where he served on the town board.
It was for naught. A little more than a week later, the annexation plan was effectively shelved. On April 23, Tillis announced that "House Bill 1133 (Huntersville Annexation) will be deferred ... based on the feedback received at the public hearing." In its place, the town would assemble an advisory board -- political doublespeak for doing nothing.
A TURN AGAINST ANNEXATION
Eventually, larger economic trends overwhelmed discussion of annexation. The collapse of the housing market that set in motion the Great Recession tore through Charlotte, decimating the region's property values.

The poor economy didn't dissuade Tillis from more real estate speculation. From 2008 to 2010, he and his family-run holding company, TRT Holdings, purchased at least four investment properties in foreclosure and rented them out, much as they did with the trailer park. By June 2009, TRT Holdings had amassed more than $550,000 worth of houses and trailer parks in low-rent areas around Charlotte.
Tillis continued to push legislation that had the potential to affect his real estate interests. On June 13, he went to the House floor to lobby against a small franchise tax on limited-liability corporations that own and rent property. Landlords, he warned, could "be subject to hundreds of dollars of unanticipated expenses." Tillis' procedural efforts to stop the hike eventually failed. But in the final budget, the proposed tax increase was excluded.
As Republicans made political gains in the state, Tillis' political prospects rose. Gradually, he soured on annexations, perhaps burned from his failed efforts in 2007. As state politics drifted to the right, favoring a limited role for government, Tillis began developing a reputation as a lead advocate for reforming North Carolina's annexation laws.
In 2009, he co-sponsored a bill that would have placed a moratorium on forcible land annexations. The bill failed, but Tillis kept trying. In 2011, he was elected speaker of the state House. A year later, he helped build support for a bill that significantly limited annexations, and which later became law.
A statewide ballot initiative on annexation was proposed for this November, but did not qualify for the ballot.
Four years after he bought it, Tillis rid himself of the trailer park on Ramah Church Road.  His brother had moved out of the state and he lacked the time to manage it himself, his campaign said. He sold the property in April 2011 for $250,000 -- far less than the $450,000 he had originally sought for the park when he first listed it for sale in 2009, or the $395,000 he paid for it in 2007. The sale brought the property full circle. His wife, Susan Tillis, was the broker for the transaction. The buyer was Ron Julian.
"I heard somewhere that Thom was looking to get rid of the mobile home park, so I offered him $250,000 and he said yes," Julian told HuffPost. Tillis lost at least $145,000 on the sale.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story reported incorrectly that an annexation initiative would be voted on this November. The proposed initiative did not qualify for the ballot.

The Good News and Bad News About 5.9 Percent Unemploymentreddit
The jobs report on Friday showed the economy created 248,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell below 6.0 percent for the first time since the early days of the recession. This is good news for workers. While we are still far from anything resembling full employment, it is getting easier for people to find jobs.
If the economy keeps creating jobs at this pace, workers will finally have enough bargaining power to see some real wage gains, thereby getting their share of the benefits of economic growth. But this is also the bad news in the story. There are many powerful people who want to keep these wage gains from happening.
Immediately after the jobs report was released, James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, was on television insisting that the Fed had to start raising interest rates. Bullard complained that the Fed was behind schedule and needed to slow the economy to prevent inflation.
There should be no ambiguity about what Bullard was saying. He knows that higher interests will keep people from getting jobs. If the Fed raises interest rates it will discourage people from buying homes and cars. Fewer people will refinance mortgages, which has been a way for tens of millions of people to free up money for other spending over the last few years.
Higher interest rates will also have some effect in reducing investment. They will also make it more difficult for state and local governments to finance bond issues for building or repairing infrastructure. And they will increase the value of the dollar, which makes our goods less competitive internationally, thereby increasing the trade deficit.
Bullard wants to see the economy slow because he doesn't want to see more workers get jobs. This is because when more workers get jobs, it will increase their bargaining power and they will be in a position to demand higher wages. This is exactly the inflation that worries Bullard. If workers are getting higher wages then we will see more inflation than in a situation where wages are stagnant. Bullard wants the Fed to slow the economy so that wages remain stagnant.
If Bullard were just an obscure voice in the wilderness, we could all have a good laugh and get on to real issues. Unfortunately, he is a member of the Fed's 19 person Open Market Committee that decides interest rate policy. Several of the other district bank presidents who sit on this committee have expressed similar views.
More importantly, there are many prominent economists and business people outside of the Fed who press the same concerns as Bullard. As many reports on the better than expected jobs numbers said, the September jobs report will make the Fed's job more difficult. There will be more pressure on Fed chair Janet Yellen and other inflation doves to start raising interest rates.
This is where the political realities of the Fed's policymaking process really matter. The Fed has been structured in a way that gives the financial industry, with its obsessive concern about inflation, excessive control over Fed policy. The twelve district bank presidents who comprise the bulk of the open market committee (only five vote at any one time) are appointed through a process that is dominated by the banks in the district. The seven governors (only five seats are currently filled) who make up the rest of the committee are appointed by the president and subject to congressional approval.
These governors serve 14-year terms; which is supposed to insulate them from political pressure. But the governors also tend to be unduly deferential to the concerns of the financial industry. Traditionally many of the governors have also had backgrounds in finance. For example, Stanley Fischer, who is currently vice-chair, had a stint as a top executive at Citigroup after a long career as an academic economist.
Thus far Yellen has been a strong voice for staying the course, arguing that the risks of an inflationary spiral are still remote. Her position enjoys strong support in the data. Inflation continues to come in below the Fed's 2.0 percent target. And since this is an average, not a ceiling, the Fed can allow inflation to be above 2.0 percent for some time and still be keeping to its target - which is not itself written in stone.
But in Washington, reality always takes a back seat to politics. And there is a real danger that the political power of the financial sector will force Yellen to start slowing the economy and stopping job growth long before workers gain any bargaining power. This risk will be greater if the public sits back and leaves Fed policy to the "experts."

Elect a government that works in tandem with the Centre: ShahComments
Amit Shah at an election rally in Pune on Monday. (Express photo by Arul Horizon)
BJP president Amit Shah on Monday urged the people of Maharashtra to vote for a government that works in tandem with the Centre in the upcoming Assembly polls.
Speaking at a poll rally in Hadapsar, where he was campaigning for BJP candidates from Hadapsar and Purandar Assembly seats Yogesh Tilekar and Sangita Nimbalkar, respectively, Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted Maharashtra to grow on all fronts and added that the state’s growth had suffered a setback in the Congress-NCP’s 15-year regime.
“Maharashtra is the growth engine of the country and if we want the state to develop, we need to give the BJP complete majority,’’ implored Shah. “Maharashtra should have a government that will work jointly with Narendra Modi at the Centre,” he said.
Shah further said Congress and NCP do not have leaders who can work in tandem with the Centre. “A CM who hesitates to attend functions for fear of being heckled will not be able to carry out the PM’s dream of taking the nation and all the states ahead,’’ he said.
Shah alleged the Congress and the NCP of being involved in rampant corruption. “Before asking for votes, they should answer queries about the 101 scams worth Rs 11.88 crore pointed out by our senior leader Eknath Khadse,’’ said Shah. He lambasted NCP president Sharad Pawar and said that despite being Union Agriculture Minister, Pawar could not prevent over 35,000 farmers’ suicides in the state.
“Maharashtra was among top performing states many years back. However, the Congress- NCP rule has not only brought the state’s development to a dismal level, but has also brought about corruption in the cooperative movement and operation of sugar factories,’’ he said.
Earlier, at a rally in Lonavala, Shah said prices have come down after Modi’s swearing-in and the trend would continue in the coming months.

Indian Economy to Grow by 6.4% in 2015-16: World BankFDI Dips 16 Per Cent to $2.45 Billion in September
Washington: Indian economy, which accounts for 80 per cent of South Asia's output, is set to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2015-16 as against 5.6 per cent in 2014-15, the World Bank has said.
With economic activity buoyed by expectations from the new elected government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, "India is benefiting from a "Modi dividend"," the bank said in its twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus report released on Monday.
Over the next year or so economic growth should be supported by the recovering US economy that would provide a market for Indian merchandise and service exports, it said.
"The outlook over the next years for South Asia indicates broad economic stability and a pick-up in growth with potential risks concentrated on the fiscal and structural reform side," said Martin Rama, chief economist for South Asia at the World Bank.
"Future growth will increasingly depend on strong investment and export performance," he added.
Private investment is expected to pick up thanks to the government's business orientation, and declining oil prices should boost private sector competitiveness.
But economic reforms will be needed for India to achieve its full long-term growth potential, the report argued.
The report said the region's economy will expand by a real 6 per cent in 2015 and by 6.4 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.4 per cent this year, potentially making it the second fastest growing region in the world after East Asia and the Pacific.
Other countries in the region are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The bank said India's long-term growth potential remains high due to favourable demographics, relatively high savings, and policies and efforts to improve skills and education, facilitate domestic market integration and incentivize manufacturing activities.
In the medium term, with the economy still below potential and reforms on a gradualist path, growth is expected to accelerate from 5.6 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent and 7 per cent in 2016 and 2017.
Inflation is expected to decline with monetary policy switching to inflation targeting while the current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat as import demand and capital inflows rise.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue with stronger revenue mobilisation, while the oil subsidy burden could decline to 0.6 per cent of GDP if benign global crude prices persist, it said.
Supply chain delays and uncertainty are a major yet under-appreciated constraint to manufacturing growth and competitiveness in India, it said.

The end of the legal struggle over same-sex marriage may now be sightBy Ilya Somin October 6
Today’s Supreme Court decision not to review lower-court cases invalidating laws banning same-sex marriage increases the already high probability that we are headed for an eventual ruling invalidating such laws nationwide. Several factors converge to increase that likelihood.
First, as a result of today’s action by the justices, there will soon be a total of thirty states where same-sex marriage is now legal , including eleven likely to be directly affected by the Court’s refusal to review decisions striking down their laws. By the time the Court gets around to considering the issue a year or two or more from now, many same-sex couples in those states will have gotten married in the meantime. That will make it difficult for the Court to reach a decision that potentially calls the legality of thousands of new marriages into question. The justices could try to get around this dilemma by doing something similar to what the California Supreme Court did in the aftermath of Proposition 8: “grandfathering” in the same-sex marriages that occurred in between its previous decision legalizing same-sex marriage and the enactment of the state constitutional amendment reversing it. But such a ruling could be awkward and difficult to implement.
In addition, public support for same-sex marriage continues to increase at a rapid pace . A Supreme Court decision on the issue a couple years from now would likely occur in a political atmosphere even more favorable to same-sex marriage than that of today. That is unlikely to sway justices with a strong preexisting commitment to one side or the other. But it could affect key swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, assuming he is indeed on the fence right now.
Conservative blogger John Hinderaker suggests that today’s developments might actually benefit opponents of gay marriage. If a Republican president is elected in 2016 and is able to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Stephen Breyer with a social conservative, that might create a anti-gay marriage majority on the Court, thereby eliminating Kennedy’s role as the swing voter. Hinderaker speculates that some or all of the four conservative justices who dissented in United States v. Windsor might have voted against hearing the gay marriage cases right now, in hopes that this will happen.
While this scenario is possible, I don’t think it is all that likely. Even if the GOP does win the presidency in 2016 (which is far from a sure thing), Ginsburg and Breyer would likely try to stay on the Court long enough to decide the gay marriage issue. It could very well be decided even before the 2016 election happens. Finally, a close 5-4 decision upholding laws banning gay marriage may not last for long. If public and elite sentiment continues to turn against such laws, the ruling would likely suffer the same fate as Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), which upheld anti-sodomy laws, but was widely reviled and got overruled in 2003. In this case, the tide of opinion is moving faster, and a reversal could happen sooner than that.
In sum, we are now likely to get a Supreme Court decision striking down laws banning same-sex marriage sometime in the next few years. But there are several different rationales that the Court could use to reach such a decision. They could rule that laws banning gay marriage are invalid because they discriminate on the basis of sex, because they discriminate against gays and lesbians, because they violate a “fundamental” right to marriage, or because they fail even minimal rational basis scrutiny. Which option they choose is likely to have important implications for constitutional theory and for future decisions on other issues. We can now be fairly confident about where the train is going. But it isn’t yet clear what route it will take to get there.

Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase have revealed in recent weeks that each was hit by one of the largest security breaches the retail and banking industries have ever seen.
But Wall Street — and consumers — appear ready to shrug it off.
The home improvement retailer’s stock is up more than 14 percent this year and more than 2 percent since it confirmed a six-month breach of its payment system that affected some 53 million credit and debit cards. Home Depot says it expects its sales growth this year to be unaffected by the massive cyber intrusion.
And after JPMorgan said last Thursday that cybercriminals had obtained customer names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses for 76 million households, the company’s stock price has hardly budged.
The companies may be benefiting from what experts say is a potentially dangerous shift among consumers: data breach fatigue.
Shoppers, they say, have become numb to reports that their credit cards and other personal information have been compromised as incidents have piled up in the last year. Target suffered a major breach during last year’s holiday shopping frenzy. Restaurants P.F. Chang’s and Jimmy John’s have acknowledged hacks this year. So have Neiman Marcus , Michaels and Sally Beauty Supply . SuperValu says it was hacked twice this year.
There have been 579 data breaches this year , a 27.5 percent increase over the same period last year, and it is only expected to become more common as consumers become more dependent on Internet-connected devices, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center.
Recent research suggests that many consumers have become complacent about these intrusions: Some 32 percent of consumers said they “ignored the notifications and did nothing” when they were alerted to a possible data breach involving their personal information, according to a study by the Ponemon Institute, which studies information security. In the same study, 71 percent of respondents said they did not stop doing business with the company that had been breached.
Their explanations help explain why some consumers may be reaching breach fatigue: In many cases, those surveyed said they believed data breaches are “unavoidable” and affect most companies. Still more said it was too hard to find similar products from another company.
“I think we get upset. I think we get angry. And then we go back to what’s easy, convenient and we’re used to,” said Steven Weisman, a senior lecturer at Bentley University and author of “Identify Theft Alert.”
Joshua Cyr, a Web developer from Portsmouth, N.H., was notified last month that his credit card had been compromised during the Home Depot intrusion. He was annoyed by the hassle of having to get a new card, but he said it won’t change his shopping habits much.
“I can use Home Depot again because they’re probably going to be more secure after the fact,” Cyr said. “But there’s also not a lot of options,” he added, for buying similar goods.
Experts say some of the nonchalance about breaches may be because consumers largely haven’t been on the hook for  fraudulent charges in these incidents.  Under federal law , consumers are not liable for unauthorized purchases made with a stolen credit card number.  They could be liable in some cases for fraudulent debit card purchases, but many banks cover those anyway.
And some breached retailers, including Home Depot and Target, have offered free credit monitoring services to customers who may have been affected by the breaches.
“I don’t think consumers really take it out on retailers like they had two or three years ago,” said Terry Redding, vice president of marketing at CFI Group, a firm that provides customer feedback to the retail industry.
JPMorgan’s breach, meanwhile, may not be spurring strong consumer backlash because it doesn’t involve especially sensitive personal information.  Details such as a customer’s address and telephone number are readily available from other sources.
Still, experts say consumers ignore notifications of possible breaches at their own peril, as cybercriminals will likely continue to find holes in retailers’ security systems. And while a breach that affects only credit card numbers can be fixed relatively easily by obtaining a new card, a future theft could include bank account information or other sensitive data that enables full-scale identity theft, which is much harder to thwart.
Home Depot may also be getting the benefit of the doubt thanks to its strong financial bottom line. The company recently delivered an especially solid second quarter, a marker of reassurance of the company’s broader health at a time when many retailers saw meager sales growth. By contrast, Target was already struggling with lackluster sales when its systems were compromised.
Home Depot said that in the wake of the breach its September sales remained in line with its previous expectations. The company also said it expects 4.8 percent sales growth for fiscal 2014, unchanged from its forecast before the discovery of the breach.
The attacks at both Home Depot and Target took place during each company’s most crucial seasons. For Home Depot, that’s spring, when warm weather typically heralds a pick-up in construction activity and home improvement projects. The Target breach took place and was disclosed just before Christmas, the busiest shopping period of the year. Still, Laura Kennedy, senior analyst at consultancy Kantar Retail, said Home Depot may have benefited from the breach being discovered and disclosed in September, a period when shopping is not top-of-mind for consumers.
Some analysts said that customers may also have appreciated Home Depot’s relative swiftness in communicating with them about its breach. While Target took about a week to notify customers of its cyberattack, Home Depot announced that it was investigating a possible intrusion before the company had even confirmed it occurred. (However, Home Depot’s statement came after information security blogger Brian Krebs had written a story about a possible breach.)
“While the PR side of things was very much typical Home Depot: straightforward, up-front,”  Kennedy said, “there’s the bigger question of why it took four to five months to discover that it was happening.”
Target’s breach undoubtedly created drag for the retail titan : Its sales stumbled immediately after the hack, and the company said it has cost them $146 million to date. But in August, chief financial officer John Mulligan said that the “vast majority” of Target shoppers who came to the store before the breach have since returned, a sign that the company is regaining consumers’ trust.
The next clear snapshot of just how much Home Depot has been affected by the breach should come in November, when the company is slated to report its third quarter earnings.
“[The breach] hurts; you don’t want it to happen,” said Efraim Levy, an analyst with S&P Capital IQ. “But I think they can bounce back.”

JPMorgan breach raises alarm of financial systemComments
Security experts and officials are concerned that the hackers who engineered the massive cyberattack on JPMorgan lingered in the system and returned at least five times to see how far they could penetrate the financial giant’s internal networks. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)

The hackers who orchestrated the massive cyberattacks on JPMorgan Chase this summer appeared to target far more than mere consumer data, sparking concern among government and industry officials of whether the ultimate aim was to disrupt Wall Street itself, people familiar with the investigation of the incident said.
The recent cyberattacks against Home Depot, Target and other retailers were akin to a jewelry store heist. The apparent thieves broke in, took as many credit card numbers as quickly as possible and then got out.
In the case of JPMorgan, hackers got access to a massive number of accounts — 83 million households and businesses. But security experts and officials are more concerned that the attackers lingered in the system and returned at least five times to see how far they could penetrate the financial giant’s internal networks, which are generally thought to be among the most secure in corporate America, said people with knowledge of the attack who were not authorized to speak publicly. That behavior indicates something more nefarious than a simple robbery.
Ultimately, the hackers appeared to cull only e-mail and physical addresses of customers, the bank has said. But the attack has raised alarms in Washington, New York and beyond, given Wall Street’s critical place in the U.S. economy.
The bank houses a wide range of sensitive financial information that in the wrong hands could create havoc.
“Knowing that someone is trying to gather intelligence about one of the largest operators in our financial system is disconcerting,” said Chester Wisniewski, a senior adviser for Sophos, a security software vendor. “If this happens at Citibank, Bank of America or other banks, it could be a very destabilizing force to the American economy.”
With the right level of access into the networks of key Wall Street firms, hackers could disrupt the financial markets, consumer advocates say.
“Their goal could have been mayhem, not just cash,” Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at U.S. PIRG, said about the JPMorgan breach. “We’ve built a lot of protections into our banking system, but I’m not sure that we’ve really thought through all of the risks today and whether we’ve done enough.”
Compared with the rest of corporate America, financial firms have enjoyed a reputation of being good at thwarting major network assaults because of their heavy investment in security. JPMorgan alone boasted of spending $250 million a year on its defenses prior to the recent attack.
The financial industry is projected to spend as much as $2,500 per employee on cybersecurity this year, compared with the $400 per worker invested by retail and consumer product businesses, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
“Everybody is pretty terrible at cybersecurity, but financial firms and defense contractors have it together the most,” said Wisniewski, the Sophos adviser. “When you consider the size of the targets painted on their backs, the one or two incidents that you’ve heard about implies that they are doing a really good job, because you can imagine how many people are trying to steal their information.”
That’s not to say that Wall Street has been immune to cybercrime. Two years ago, hackers commandeered servers at several big banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan, shutting down Web sites for hours at a time and disrupting customer transactions. A year earlier, Citigroup was the victim of an attack that affected the credit card accounts of more than 360,000 customers.
“This isn’t our first rodeo,” said Doug Johnson, senior vice president of risk management policy at American Bankers Association, a trade group. “The information sharing across the sector has helped other institutions know what these attacks look like for them to be on alert.”
Yet none of those earlier attacks seemed to involve the same level of infiltration into the banks’ networks as the JPMorgan intrusion. Hackers accessed the bank’s system in June, making several additional attempts to collect data until the bank caught wind of the attacks in August, the people said. They hit more than 90 servers over the course of the intrusion.
People close to the investigation said the hackers obtained and found vulnerabilities in a partial list of JPMorgan’s open source applications — software programs that are shared among firms and are commonly used within cybersecurity circles.
“The level of what hackers did at retailers was not rocket science, but getting into the country’s biggest bank raises consumer confidence questions. Are people going to start putting their money under a mattress?” Mierzwinski said.
The severity of the threat of continued attacks on the nation’s financial giants has not been lost on regulators and law enforcement. Benjamin M. Lawsky, head of New York’s Department of Financial Services, has been in discussions with JPMorgan and other banks about the urgency of tightening cybersecurity measures.
Meanwhile, the FBI and Secret Service are working with JPMorgan to piece together what happened at the bank and “determine the scope of the attacks.”

Modi s assets fall by Rs. 26 lakh post-electionThe Hindu Prime Minister Narendra Modi
TOPICS
government
Senior members of the NDA government have seen a fall in their wealth before and after the elections, but the change is not explained by their official spending on the elections.
The details of the assets of Cabinet Ministers were uploaded to the Prime Minister’s website on Monday, and offered a comparison with the assets declared by ministers just a few months ago, before the general election.
The Prime Minister has seen a Rs.26-lakh fall in his assets from the pre-election Rs.1.52 crore to Rs.1.26 crore as of August. The outflow has been from his bank deposits and fixed deposits, a close look at Election Commission documents shows. However, this change is not explained by his election expenses; as per official records, Mr. Modi spent only Rs.27,000 of his personal funds on his two parliamentary campaigns in Vadodara and Varanasi, the rest of his poll expenditure coming from party funds.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s declaration on the PMO website does not specify whether the assets declared are from before or after the election, but there is a nearly Rs.5-lakh increase between the assets declared by Mr. Singh before the election and the assets now uploaded to the PMO website. Mr. Singh officially spent Rs.1 lakh of his own money on his election campaign in Lucknow.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s assets as on the PMO website have not been updated after the elections, dating back to March of this year. In April this year, when she filed her nomination, Ms. Swaraj declared assets worth Rs.17.55 crore.
Finance and Defence Minister Arun Jaitley is over Rs.97 lakh richer than when he filed his nomination for his unsuccessful campaign from Amritsar. The major change is his purchase in April this year of a house in Amritsar, which he had hoped to make his constituency. Mr. Jaitley declared having spent just Rs.50,000 of his own money on his election campaign.
Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari is roughly Rs.20,000 poorer after the election, but spent just over Rs.7 lakh on his campaign, official documents show.

The Shanghai Free Trade Zone is a dudThe Shanghai Free Trade Zone is a dud
By MacKenzie Sigalos   @CNNMoney October 12, 2014: 11:40 PM ET
A storage facility in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone.
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
When it opened one year ago, the Shanghai Free Trade Zone was hyped as a laboratory for economic reform that would help push China into a new golden age of prosperity.
But many analysts say the trade zone has fallen well short of expectations.
"It's great talk by [Premier Li Keqiang] and a lot of senior government officials, but there's no execution," said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. "Nobody knows what you can do."
The zone is located on a 29-square-kilometer patch of land on the outskirts of Shanghai. At its core, the zone is a tax-free trading hub, but it was also supposed to attract foreign investment and introduce currency reforms that would make the yuan a viable alternative to the dollar and the euro.
While the project is thought to still enjoy the support of Beijing, reforms have been slow to materialize. On the thorny issues of how to loosen capital controls and liberalize interest rates, almost no progress has been made.
Dai Haibo, the zone's de facto head, stepped aside in September, reportedly the victim of a graft probe.
 
How China's iPhone 6 black market works
"I think that [the Shanghai Free Trade Zone] was oversold. And in many ways, it was overbought," said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management.
Chovanec said that confusion reigns over what exactly can be done in the zone, a problem that has plagued the project from the day it opened.
"I'm confused and I follow it. Maybe there are some lawyers out there who aren't confused, but I doubt it," he said. "I think everyone's confused about exactly what the latest rules that have been promulgated mean in practice."
So far, there are no signs that the Shanghai FTZ holds the key to transforming China's economy in the way that the "special economic zones" pioneered more than 30 years ago by then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping changed the country's trajectory.
Deng's reforms turned Shenzhen from a small fishing village into a manufacturing powerhouse, and helped turn China into the world's biggest exporter.
CNNMoney: This is why Hong Kong matters
Yet for firms that choose to do business in today's Shanghai zone, there are a few bright spots.
Jianjun Long, a Hunan-based business owner, said he wants to register a rental financing company in the zone because there is less red tape -- he will be able to get his business off the ground much more quickly.
Peng Zhenwei, an economist with the Shanghai-based research firm CEBM Group, says the zone has been targeting low-priority reforms like removing red tape and easing the exchange of goods, rather than capital.
Long, the business owner, agrees. "The flow of currencies is still not as easy as we thought," he said.
For now, many companies appear content to register and open small offices in the zone -- a bet that future reforms will fulfill the project's promise. Amazon, for example, plans to open a single warehouse.
"A foreign company might want to establish some kind of presence in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, so that if some day actually there's a rule that allows you to do something interesting, you're there," Chovanec said. "You don't lose anything by doing that."

Samsung hammered by weak phone salesSamsung hammered by weak smartphone sales

iPhone 6 vs. Galaxy Alpha: Cost to make
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
Samsung is on track to report its weakest financial results in recent memory as the company loses ground in the intense battle for smartphone customers.
South Korea-based Samsung said Tuesday that it would report operating profit of around 4.1 trillion won ($3.8 billion) for the third quarter -- a 60% decline from the previous year. The result is worse than analysts had expected.
Third quarter sales were also lower than the previous year, falling 20% to around 47 trillion won ($44 billion). The figures are a preliminary forecast, and Samsung will release an official report in the coming weeks.
Samsung shares were up slightly in morning trading in Seoul, but the stock has declined 15% so far this year.
Related: Forget Samsung, Xiaomi is China's new smartphone king
The company blamed the weak performance on slow growth and lower operating margins in the smartphone business, where it has lost ground to high-end competitors including Apple. At the other end of the cost spectrum, upstart smartphone makers like China's Xiaomi have stolen market share from Samsung.
 
Samsung's new bendable TVs
The pressure on Samsung is part of an industry-wide trend driven by declining margins and growing saturation in the smartphone business. Samsung said it "cautiously" expects to ship more phones and TV products in the next quarter.
In the meantime, Samsung has been forced to rely on sales from other parts of its business including semiconductors and other technology to offset smartphone losses. Samsung did not provide a detailed breakdown of profit by business.
The company is now at a critical juncture. Chairman Lee Kun-hee has been ill after suffering from heart trouble earlier this year, raising questions over the company's future leadership and direction.

Mahindra to Buy 51% in Peugeot Scooter Unit

Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
Mumbai: India's largest utility vehicle maker, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, is in exclusive talks to buy the world's oldest maker of motorised two-wheelers from France's PSA Peugeot Citroen.
Mahindra has made a binding offer for a 51 percent stake in loss-making Peugeot Scooters and would subscribe to a 15 million euro ($18.9 million) capital increase to finance projects, the companies said in separate statements on Tuesday.
"In a European market that has been in steep decline for several years, the partnership with M&M would enable Peugeot Scooters to diversify its business base and speed its international expansion," Peugeot Scooters said.
Number two in Europe behind Italy's Piaggio, Peugeot Scooters has been hit by a sales slump caused by the economic crisis, helmets becoming mandatory in the key Italian market from 2000 and a boom in mobile phones that has eaten into the budgets of young people.
Since 2007, the market has shrunk by 45 per cent, falling 13 per cent in 2013, according to a Peugeot Scooters spokesman. The company produced 79,000 scooters last year.
Its French plant in Mandeure employs 500 people and produces about 25 per cent of the firm's scooters, mainly high-end models, while its Chinese plant in Jinan - in a joint venture with Qinji employs 300 staff and produces 65 per cent of Peugeot Scooters' volume. The remainder is produced in Taiwan.
In Europe, consumers buy 500,000 scooters per year - compared with 13 million in China - but competition is intense, with more than 100 Asian brands competing for market share.
Peugeot has been manufacturing motorbikes and scooters since 1898. It peaked in the 1970s with the Peugeot 103 moped, of which it sold a record 550,617 in 1974 alone. Peugeot Scooters has been losing money for about 10 years.

Wrigley Field s renovation is all in the detailsReport reveals strong focus on smallest details in Wrigley Field renovation
Wrigley remodel reveals little-known details

Wrigley renovation is all in the details. Matter of fact, that chain-link fence matters.
At the northwest corner of Wrigley Field, adjoining the outer wall of the lower grandstand, sits a one-story building.
Its beige brick masonry walls and concrete base are easy to overlook. Yet the Chicago Cubs are going to great lengths to preserve the structure as they launch a $375 million renovation of the 100-year-old stadium.
The building was built in 1923 for the team's longtime groundskeeper, Bobby Dorr, and is known as the groundskeeper's house. Legend has it that the team's owner, William Wrigley Jr., came up with the idea of building a cottage for Dorr.
Wrigley Field is known for the center-field scoreboard, the ivy, the red marquee and the brick wall that encircles the field.

There are also several lesser-known features — such as the groundskeeper's house — that contribute to the historic character and architectural integrity of the ballpark, said Chicago architect T. "Gunny" Harboe, hired by the team to oversee the restoration of historic features.
In a 105-page report he wrote for the Cubs last year, obtained by the Tribune through a Freedom of Information Act request, Harboe provided details of these elements, including steel pipe handrails and chain-link fencing.
"All these bits and pieces are part of the whole story about the way the place functioned," Harboe told the Tribune. "It's all about what is the story of the building and how do you continue that story in a true way."
In remodeling Wrigley, the Cubs are trying to balance preservation with modernization.

In New York market, US dollar nursed heavy losses on Monday, having suffered its biggest one-day fall in a year as it reversed almost all of its US payrolls-inspired gains.
In the global market today, the dollar was a tad higher against the yen in Asia trade early trade, trimming earlier gains after comments by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about the debilitating effects of a weak yen on households and small and mid-sized companies.
Meanwhile, the BSE benchmark Sensex dropped by 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent to finish at 26,271.97.
In forward market, premium ended almost flat in the absence of market-moving factors.

An American teenager has been arrested by the FBI after he allegedly tried to travel to Turkey to join the Islamic State terror group , officials said.
Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, a US citizen, was arrested at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago on October 4 before he attempted to fly to Vienna, Austria, on his way to Turkey.

He was charged yesterday in a criminal complaint filed in US District Court with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.
He appeared yesterday in US District Court in Chicago and remains in federal custody pending a detention hearing on Thursday.

According to FDI, law enforcement agents observed Khan passing through the security screening checkpoint at O’Hare’s international terminal.
Federal agents then executed a search warrant at Khan’s residence and recovered multiple handwritten documents that appeared to be drafted by Khan and/or others, which expressed support for ISIL, the affidavit alleges.
Some of those documents, including travel plans and materials referencing ISIL and jihad, are described in the complaint affidavit.
If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a USD 250,000 fine.
According to the criminal complaint, Khan wrote to his parents before leaving for the Chicago airport he was leaving the United States and on the way to join ISIS.
In a three-page letter, he invited his family to join him, but warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans.
His parents refused to comment, The Chicago Tribune said.
“As Khan was being led from the courtroom by deputy marshals, his father put his arm around Khan’s weeping mother and sought to calm her,” the daily said.

Services Growth Quickened in September: PMIFDI Dips 16 Per Cent to $2.45 Billion in September
Bangalore: Growth in services activity picked up pace in September as order books filled up at a faster rate, a business survey showed on Tuesday.
The HSBC Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 51.6 in September from 50.6 in August, reversing a slowdown seen in the previous two months.
A reading above 50 signifies growth while anything below denotes contraction.
The new business sub-index climbed to 52.4 from 51.9, signalling robust demand.
"Service sector activity bottomed out in September thanks to stronger new business flows," said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at survey sponsor HSBC.
In what might also give some respite to an economy that has long struggled with high inflation, the sub-index measuring output price growth fell to a near four-year low.
India's annual consumer price inflation eased in August to 7.80 per cent from 7.96 per cent in July. Wholesale prices also rose at a slower clip during that month.
But the Reserve Bank of India doesn't appear to be in a hurry to ease monetary policy and hinted last week that it won't do so until it is confident that consumer inflation can be reduced to a target of 6 percent by January 2016.
Activity in the private sector has expanded steadily since May, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a landslide mandate that created a wave of optimism over India's economic prospects.
The survey showed firms' confidence regarding future business grew at the slowest pace in a year last month.
"A pick up in reform effort is sorely needed to put growth on a firmer footing and address supply side risks to inflation," Neumann said.

GOTHAM RECAP (Ep. 3): Vigilantes  violence and vengeance! Why  look who popped in.WHO SHOT OSWALD? Perhaps no one, it turns out, upon the return of Oswald Cobblepot, flashing a Penguin-y smirk. (FOX TV)
 
IT TOOK ONLY three episodes, but Gotham City finally has a vigilante.
We can’t get too excited yet. Bruce Wayne has yet to discover the significance of tricep pull-downs, so we know it isn’t the Bat. Instead we get…..Balloonman.
The third episode of “Gotham” gives us our first taste of vigilantism and the effect it has on Gotham City. Balloonman takes corrupt Gotham officials who’ve only brought pain to the city and literally ties them to balloons, sending them to a high-altitude death that includes one heck of a fall. So of course, he becomes popular in the city very quickly, proving two things:
1. Gotham’s citizens are hungry for justice.
2. And they don’t care how they get it.
Here are Comic Riffs’ 10 Takeaways from episode three of Fox’s “Gotham.”
1. Oswald’s cobbled-together existence
Ah, Oswald has returned to Gotham City. He’s hungry for vengeance — and flat-out just hungry. Oswald has fallen on hard times, but he’s doing as well as he can, considering he’s supposed to be dead. Oswald soaks up the Gotham air, witnessing acts of possible prostitution and purse-snatching within mere seconds. He’s so happy to be back. Now comes the difficult task of somehow rising to the ranks of Gotham’s top gangsters — with only a handful of spare change in his pocket. Someone recognizes Oswald and pulls him aside, convinced there will be a nice payday for Oswald’s being taken to Fish Mooney. It’s too early for Oswald’s return to become known, so he does the only thing he can do: He kills his would-be captor and psychotically goes about his business as if nothing has happened, using a $100 bill he’s stolen from his latest victim to buy some much-needed food. He may be quite a way from taking over Gotham’s criminal empire, but certain parts of the job, he’s clearly comfortable with.
Oswald gets a job at a mobbed-up food spot (after killing the guy who stood in his way of the job). And who happens to run the place? Salvatore Maroni (David Zayas) a mob boss looking to come after Carmine Falcone. Maroni sees Oswald (who at this point is just a guy in the kitchen) as a reflection of his earlier self. He came from nothing, too, he says. He gives Oswald a roll of cash. Is this where Oswald will learn the mob trade? Will he grow to become one of Maroni’s top lieutenants? Will he use Maroni to take down his enemies? Is Maroni safe?
2. A vigilante emerges
The first victim of Balloonman is someone who’s managed to stay out of jail despite robbing innocent Gothamites of their pensions. When Detectives Bullock and Gordon find the victim spread all over a Gotham sidewalk, Bullock has few tears to shed. Gordon as always, wants things done by the book. Bullock seems to think that the case is closed and the victim got what he deserved. “I’m gonna go get a Danish. That’s what I deserve,” Bullock tells Gordon. Through three episodes, it’s clear that Bullock is good for at least one zinger a week. Bullock is more likable and less corrupt this week (though not by much), but we know that will change from week to week. We get a nod to the fanboys when Balloonman commits his first crime in a pig mask. Could we be looking at Professor Pyg (wouldn’t Grant Morrison be amused)? Alas, no. It’s just a random mask as the killer conceals his identity (we figure out who it is by the end of the episode). Still, it was fun. We know legit Batman rogues are coming, but not just yet.
3. Selina visits Gordon
Gordon gets a visit from Selina, who is about to be sent upstate with other orphans. Gordon lets it be known that while she’s helping with an investigation, she won’t be sent away. Bullock is ticked that Gordon is still looking into the Wayne case. It’s closed, he keeps reminding Gordon. But Selina may have info. Selina and Gordon go back to the scene of the Wayne murder. Selina re-enacts the murder, but doesn’t convince Gordon that she’s able to help with the case. Maybe she’s just trying to avoid being sent upstate. Selina says her help is legit. She really does want to help the young Wayne boy she still doesn’t know. AND she says she saw the shooter before he covered his face; maybe she could identify him. Gordon still isn’t convinced that Selina was there the night of the Wayne murders. Selina says she picked the pocket of a guy blocks away right before the shooting. Gordon says he’s aware of that, but that it still doesn’t prove she’s a witness. She says she dropped the wallet in the sewer on the same street where they are re-enacting the crime. Gordon still doesn’t trust her. He handcuffs her and heads down into the sewer. Gordon finds the wallet; Selina wasn’t lying. Gordon now realizes that Selina is a major part of this supposedly closed case. Before he can question her, though, she throws the handcuffs down the sewer. We all just knew she’d escape, didn’t we?
4. Go Fish — and more games
Montoya and Allen — who would have you believe they’re the only good cops in Gotham — have visited Fish and ask her directly about the disappearance of Oswald. Fish says that Oswald is dead and that Gordon killed him. This makes Montoya smile on the inside, since she’d do anything to convince Gordon’s fiancee (whom Montoya is still in love with) that Jim is bad news. We know this is more of Fish’s games, though to her credit, she does think that Oswald is dead.
5. Tough love
Alfred and Bruce are having a pretend swordfight that seems part playful, but also partly to help Bruce keep his mind off of things. Bruce isn’t eating. Alfred is concerned — even more so when he discovers Bruce somehow got his hands on a file containing photos of his dead parents. Alfred can’t believe Bruce could look at such things. He tells Bruce he’ll have nightmares. Bruce says the nightmares come regardless. Alfred tries to persuade Bruce to eat, and lets him know he’s no detective. Little does Alfred know that he’s in the presence of the soon-to-be world’s greatest detective. Bruce is just getting started.
6. Montoya, Allen and Gordon…again
Montoya and Allen let Gordon know that they know that he murdered Oswald. We know Gordon just pretended to do this, of course — but they don’t know that. Gordon is a man on his own. On a police force where he is quite possibly the only good cop, the only other two people who just may be good cops, too, are convinced he’s a murderer. If Montoya and Allen are so good though, maybe they should stop depending on intel from people who are criminals with an agenda. Montoya continues to bother Barbara, now telling her she’s convinced that Gordon killed Oswald. Barbara doesn’t believe her. Montoya’s pushiness is somewhat too forceful. Surely an engaged woman isn’t the only beautiful single lady in Gotham, but this scenario gives us, quite possibly, one of Gotham’s biggest secrets. Because at some point, Gordon is going to find out the woman he loves is the former lover of the cop who is determined to take him down.
7. The Fish Eye
Carmine Falcone and Fish Mooney have perfected talking in code. Falcone’s lady friend was recently jumped. Everyone knows Fish had it done, but she denies things the way she always does. Falcone once again looks Fish in the eye and lets her know that he’ll find out who is coming after him, and that he’ll take that person down. Fish says she hopes he catches the crook. Maybe these two should just talk on the phone.
8. The last words of Balloonman
Balloonman is caught. Bullock and Gordon always get their man, as long as it doesn’t have anything to do with the Wayne murder (but then, that case is closed — ahem — remember?). Before Balloonman is taken away, Gordon tells the vigilante that what he die was wrong — that you always have to stay on the right side of the law. That’s why the laws are there. Balloonman says he’s just the beginning. In a city where everyone is corrupt, where you trust no one, people like Balloonman will keep popping up. So much irony in this scene, and it points to a transformation that will eventually take place with Gordon, since we know one day, a vigilante will be his greatest ally.
9. A turning point for Bruce
As news of the Balloonman’s capture is reported on TV, Alfred and Bruce watch the events unfold. Bruce showed an early fascination with the articles detailing what the vigilante was doing. A light bulb went off when he saw this was a man going after people who do bad things. But Bruce makes it clear to Alfred that he’s glad the vigilante was caught — words that reflect the psychological impact of his parents’ murder. He’s showing early signs of wanting to do something about people who hurt the innocent — but the vigilante on the news was a murderer, Bruce tells Alfred. That makes him just like all the other criminals, Bruce says, regardless of whether he was trying to help. Early in his development, Bruce knows there is one line he will never cross.
10. A good moment interrupted
Gordon makes it home. He’s not doing well. Barbara can see it. He tells her the city is sick. He still has the words of the vigilante in his head. The vigilante didn’t know who his next victim would be. It didn’t matter, he told Gordon — he just knew there was someone out there. Gordon tells Barbara that not only are there vigilantes on the street, but that they are also on the force with him. Barbara (with Montoya’s words still ringing in her head) takes the opportunity to ask Gordon whether he’d ever cross that line. Gordon is offended; he can’t believe Barbara had to ask. That makes Barbara happy — she’s convinced Montoya is wrong. And she’s right about that. But before she can grab a celebratory drink to share with Gordon, there’s a knock on the door. It’s a man in a nice suit. It’s Oswald. He’s looking very dapper and very much like, yes, a penguin. Gordon told Oswald never to return, and here he is, at his door.

India to Top Global Remittances With $71 Billion This Year
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 07, 2014 11:13 (IST)
DDA Housing Scheme: Draw to be Held on Tuesday
Washington: India will retain its top spot with $71 billion in remittances this year as remittances to developing countries are expected to reach $435 billion, an increase of five per cent over 2013, the World Bank has said.
In its latest issue of the Migration and Development Brief, the World Bank said India, with the world's largest emigrant stock of 14 million people, will remain in the top spot this year, attracting about $71 billion in remittances.
"Remittances to developing countries grew this year by five per cent. Remittance inflows provided stable cover for substantial parts of the import bill for such countries as Egypt, Pakistan, Haiti, Honduras, and Nepal," said Kaushik Basu, senior vice president and chief economist of the World Bank Group.
He said India and China led the chart with "projected remittance inflows of $71 and $64 billion respectively in 2014."
Other large recipients are China ($64 billion), the Philippines ($28 billion), Mexico ($24 billion), Nigeria ($21 billion), Egypt ($18 billion), Pakistan ($17 billion), Bangladesh ($15 billion), Vietnam ($11 billion) and Ukraine ($9 billion).
The growth rate this year is substantially faster than the 3.4 per cent growth recorded in 2013, driven largely by remittances to Asia and Latin America, it said.
Remittances to developing countries will continue climbing in the medium term, reaching an estimated $454 billion in 2015. Global remittances, including those to high-income countries, are estimated at $582 billion this year, rising to $608 billion next year, it said.
The bank said remittances to the South Asia region are increasing more robustly this year, accelerating from slower growth in 2013. Although flows to India, the region's largest remittance recipient, will grow modestly by 1.5 per cent in 2014.
The expansion is being led by flows from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, where skilled and unskilled workers are finding renewed job opportunities.
As a result, the growth rate of remittances to the region is expected to more than double this year to 5.5 per cent (from 2.7 per cent in 2013), boosting volumes to $117 billion in 2014 and rising further to $123 billion in 2015, it said.
"In addition, India and the Philippines benefit from having migrants with the most diverse destination spread, thereby creating buffers against regional shocks. Given the growing importance of this sector, the World Bank's Migration and Development Brief has become an essential tool for global development policy experts," Mr Basu said.

Associated Press | Washington | Posted: October 7, 2014 10:56 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:16 pm
The Pentagon has spent as much as $1.1 billion on U.S. military operations against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria since the mission began in mid-June, including more than $62 million alone in Navy airstrikes and Tomahawk cruise missiles.

U.S. Central Command, in data released Monday, said that the Navy has dropped roughly 185 munitions, including 47 cruise missiles launched from ships in the region. Central Command said Air Force fighter jets have far exceeded those numbers, launching close to 1,000 munitions. The data released Monday broke out the $62 million spent on Navy munitions, but provided no cost estimates for Air Force munitions.

The bulk of the Navy costs were for the 47 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired by American warships in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea that targeted the Khorasan Group, an al-Qaida cell, in eight locations west of the city of Aleppo in Syria. The group was said to be plotting imminent attacks on American and Western interests, and it was one of the key targets two weeks ago when the U.S. first began airstrikes into Syria.

The Most Innovative CitiesFrom technology and infrastructure, to job creation and sustainability, these 10 cities are leading the pack when it comes to creatively solving urban issues.
1 of 10
New York has made a lot of the digital age. The city hosts a thriving tech sector with 300,000 employees -- on par with Silicon Valley -- and city government is praised for its use of analytics in evaluating all manner of programs.
Its signature environmental initiative -- PlaNYC -- contains hundreds of objectives on everything from the number of breakwaters made from oysters to cubic feet of natural gas captured from sewage plants. As former mayor Michael Bloomberg would say: "In God we trust. Everyone else, bring data."
Current Mayor Bill de Blasio seems intent on keeping this emphasis on numbers, and he's expanding the city's environmental initiatives as well -- recently announcing a pledge to cut carbon emissions 80% by 2050, largely by increasing energy efficiency in buildings.
Other innovations that put New York at the top of our list include a push for micro-apartments and affordable housing, redesigning streets to make them bike and pedestrian friendly, and pioneering the use of social impact bonds to attract private money into public projects.

Tension mounts as rival Koreas exchange warning shotsPrint

Associated Press | Seoul | Posted: October 7, 2014 11:58 am | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:01 pm
Warships from the rival Koreas exchanged warning shots Tuesday after a North Korean ship briefly violated the disputed western sea boundary, a South Korean defense official said.
The shots were fired into the sea and there have been no reports of injuries and damage to the ships of either side, the official said on condition of anonymity, citing office policy.
Such exchanges are not uncommon at the sea boundary, the scene of several deadly maritime skirmishes between the Koreas in recent years. But the latest incident happened three days after a group of high-profile North Korean officials made a surprise visit to South Korea and agreed to resume senior-level talks.
South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Monday stressed the need to hold high-level talks on a regular basis, saying she hopes North Korea would show how sincere it is about improving ties.
The South Korean official said the North Korean ship was in South Korea-controlled waters for about 10 minutes before it retreated to its waters. He said a South Korea navy ship first broadcast a warning and then fired warning shots before the North Korean ship fired back at waters near the South Korean ship. The South Korean ship returned fire into the sea near the North Korean ship, the official said.
North Korean navy ships and fishing boats frequently violate the boundary drawn by the American-led U.N. command at the end of the Korean War in the early 1950s without the North’s consent. The line cuts North Korea off from rich fishing waters.
The Korean Peninsula remains at a technical state of war because the Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

Rio Tinto rejected GlencoreRio Tinto confirms it rejected Glencore takeover bid
Rio Tinto has been cutting back debts built up in acquisitions under a previous chief executive
China buys $6bn Glencore Peru mine
Anglo-Australian mining group Rio Tinto has said that it rejected a takeover bid by rival firm Glencore in August, because it was "not in the best interests" of its shareholders.
On Monday, speculation of a possible merger had caused shares in Rio Tinto to rise by more than 9% in New York.
The mining giant now has a market capitalisation of nearly £56.3bn compared with Glencore's £44.5bn.
A deal would have created the world's largest publicly listed mining group.
In a statement , Rio Tinto emphasised that no discussions were taking place with Glencore, and that there had been no contact between the two firms since the bid was rejected in August.  Glencore had originally contacted Rio about a possible deal in July.

But Bloomberg has reported that Glencore has been sounding out Rio Tinto's largest shareholder, Chinalco (Aluminium Corporation of China), on its attitude to a potential merger.
Chinalco owns about 13% of Rio Tinto.
Rio's chairman, Jan du Plessis, said the company had "made significant progress in refocusing and strengthening its business".
"The board believes that the continued successful execution of Rio Tinto's strategy will allow Rio Tinto to increase free cash flow significantly in the near term and materially increase returns to shareholders," he added.
In August, Rio Tinto reported a 21% rise in half-year profits to $5.1bn (£3.2bn) after cutting costs.
Copper bottomed
Last year, Glencore bought Swiss mining firm Xstrata, forming one of the world's biggest metals and commodities firms.
But the deal only went through on condition that Glencore sold its stake in Xstrata's copper mining project in Peru to a buyer approved by Chinese authorities.
China was concerned that the merger would have given Glencore too much power over the copper market.
In April, Glencore sold the Peruvian copper mine to a Chinese consortium for £3.6bn in cash.

Cairn Discovers Oil at Offshore Well in Senegal

Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
London:
Oil explorer Cairn Energy and its joint venture partners have discovered oil at a well offshore Senegal and further exploration work nearby is already planned, the company said on Tuesday.
The companies encountered 29 metres of net oil bearing reservoir at the FAN-1 well, located around 100 km off the coastline and 1,427 metres deep.
"We have encountered a very substantial oil bearing interval which may have significant potential as a standalone discovery," said Cairn Energy chief executive Simon Thomson.
Cairn Energy has a 40 per cent interest in three offshore blocks in Senegal, while ConocoPhillips has 35 per cent, FAR Ltd 15 per cent and Senegal's national oil company Petrosen owns 10 per cent.

Samsung s profit for Q3 likely to fall by 60 per centSamsung's operating profit for Q3 likely to fall by 60 per cent
Se Young Lee     Seoul   Last Updated: October 7, 2014  | 13:11 IST
Samsung will need to sacrifice margins to keep cheaper Chinese handsets grabbing more of its smartphone turf. (Photo: Reuters)
Samsung Electronics is heading for its first annual earnings drop since 2011 after it revealed its July-September profit would be the lowest in more than three years and said short-term prospects for smartphones were uncertain.
Samsung, which is the world's smartphone leader, has seen its global market share decline in annual terms for the past two quarters, according to Strategy Analytics, out-classed by Apple's iPhones in the premium segment and undercut by Chinese rivals like Lenovo Group and Xiaomi at the bottom end.
The South Korean technology giant said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that operating profit for the third quarter likely fell 59.7 per cent to 4.1 trillion won ($3.8 billion), well below a mean forecast of 5.6 trillion won tipped by a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 43 analysts.
This would mark Samsung's weakest quarterly profit since the second quarter of 2011 and the fourth consecutive quarter of earnings declines on an annual basis.
Samsung said in a statement that although "uncertainty" persisted in the mobile business, which accounted for nearly 70 per cent of its 2013 operating profit, it "cautiously expects" higher shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products.
Many analysts and investors believe the best days are behind Samsung's mobile division as it will need to sacrifice margins to keep cheaper Chinese handsets grabbing more of its smartphone turf, even though new products like the Galaxy Note 4 will help nudge profits higher in the current quarter.
"Samsung was too drunk on the memories of its past victories, which kept it from catching onto how the world was changing," HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh said before the guidance was released.
Despite the weak guidance, Samsung's shares were trading up in the international markets. IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee said investors appeared to be betting that the company's profits have bottomed in the third quarter.
Operating margin for the smartphone business fell in the quarter due to higher marketing expenditure and lower average selling prices, as the proportion of shipments for high-end devices fell and prices for older models dropped, Samsung said.
The South Korean firm's chip division is a lone bright spot. Samsung, the world's top memory chip maker, said returns from its memory business in the third quarter improved sequentially due to strong seasonal demand.
On Monday Samsung revealed plans to spend $14.7 billion on a new chip facility - its biggest investment in a single plant - as it leans on its semiconductor business to offset weakness in smartphones. The plant in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, would create 150,000 jobs.
The company has released new premium smartphones such as the Galaxy Note 4 in recent months, featuring metal frames in a bid to address complaints about the use of plastic in the past.
Samsung aims to launch more cost-competitive devices in the mid-to-low end segments. Analysts expect these products to appear by the end of October.
Nomura said in a note to clients in late September that Samsung would likely sacrifice margins for market share.
The brokerage tipped the company to release a new mid-tier product late this month valued at between $300 and $400, and using similar components to the flagship Galaxy S5 smartphone , which it says is priced for around $500.

Angry KPCC to discuss Tharoor remarks praising ModiUpdated: October 8, 2014 11:31 IST
Angry KPCC to discuss Tharoor remarks praising Modi
Biju Govind

Tharoor has fallen into BJP’s trap, says Sudheeran
Senior leaders of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) will meet in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday to take a decision on the statements made by Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP, supporting some of the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Speaking to journalists here on Tuesday, the Kerala Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala said that the KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran, the Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and other leaders would take a decision on the issue.
However the former KPCC president did not divulge whether the party was mooting any disciplinary action against Mr. Tharoor. “ Mr. Tharoor has been praising Modi time and again. This was not suitable to Congress party. Ordinary Congress workers are severely disturbed by his statements, ” Mr. Chennithala said.
Replying to a query on an editorial that appeared in the Congress mouthpiece Veekshanam, ridiculing Mr. Tharoor, the Minister said that no Congress leader should propagate the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Sweyamsevak Sangh. “The polices of Narendra Modi should not be allowed in the country,” he added.
He also said that he stood by what the KPCC president said on the issue. Mr. Sudheeran had said Mr. Tharoor’s pro-Modi statements had been made without consultation with Congress high command and that Mr. Tharoor had fallen into BJP’s trap.
Already KPCC office bearers M.M. Hassan and V.D. Satheesan had come out against Mr. Tharoor. Some of them have sought disciplinary action against him. For quite some time, Congress leaders in Kerala have been rattled by Mr. Tharoor’s Twitter and Facebook comments supporting Mr. Modi. The latest provocation was that Mr. Tharoor accepting the Swachh Bharat Abhiyam challenge thrown at him by Narendra Modi.
However, an unfazed Tharoor has responded through his Twitter and Facebook accounts that the hue and cry made against him were baseless.

This Managing Director Earns Rs1/ MonthYou are here: Home Corporates
MCFL Pays Rs 1/Month Salary to its Managing Director
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 06, 2014 19:29 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
Vijay Mallya-led UB Group's MCFL, which is the takeover target of two rival fertiliser firms, will pay only a token salary of Rs 1 per month to its Managing Director Deepak Anand in the current fiscal.
The salary of Rs 1 a month has been approved by shareholders for 2014-15, as also for the subsequent year 2015-16, till the next annual general meeting takes place.
Mr Anand was deputed by the UB Group as managing director of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (MCF) in April 2005 and since then he has been paid Rs 1 per month as token salary.
Meanwhile, Mr Anand is on the rolls of UB Holdings as president, Fertilisers.
Intensifying the battle for acquisition of MCFL, Deepak Fertilisers and Zuari Group both on September 26 raised their open offer prices to Rs 93.60 per share and Rs 81.60 per share, respectively.
Deepak Fertilisers had launched open offer to buy additional 26 per cent stake in MCFL in April this year at Rs 63 per share following which Zuari and UB group joined hands in May and launched open offer for same number of shares at Rs 68.55 per scrip.
The battle for control of Mangalore Chemicals heated up again after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared an open offer launched by Zuari Group firms on September 4.
The CCI had cleared the open offer of Deepak Fertilisers on August 19.
After this, both parties have announced that the open offer will start on October 1 and close on October 17. The last date for upward revision of the offer size or price was September 25.
At present, Deepak Fertiliser holds 25.31 per cent stake in MCFL, whereas consortium of Zuari group companies have 16.43 per cent stake and Vijay Mallaya's UB group 21.97 per cent stake.
Zuari Agro Chemicals had also entered into an agreement this year to use Mangalore Chemicals' facilities for contract production.
The battle for MCFL between Deepak Fertilisers and Zuari Group was triggered in April 2013 when the latter bought about 10 per cent stake in MCFL through open market.
Later, Deepak Fertilisers acquired 24.46 per cent stake in MCFL at one go in July 2013. After this, Zuari group had increased its stake to 16.43 per cent in the same month.

Private sector activity in India inched up fractionally in September amid worrying business sentiments, an HSBC survey said today while calling for a pick up in reform activity to put growth on a firmer footing.
The headline HSBC Composite Output Index stood at 51.8, up fractionally from 51.6 in August, indicating a moderate expansion in private sector output. Meanwhile, the HSBC India Services Business Activity Index, that tracks changes in activity at Indian services companies on a month-by-month basis, rose from 50.6 to 51.6.
"Services sector activity bottomed out in September thanks to stronger new business flows. However, business sentiment continues to deteriorate after a strong post-election uptick," HSBC Co-Head of Asian Economic Research Frederic Neumann said.
"A pick up in reform effort is sorely needed to put growth on a firmer footing and address supply side risks to inflation," Neumann added. Though the September data indicated growth of Indian
private sector activity for the fifth consecutive month, the pace of increase was marginal. A figure above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, while a figure below that level means contraction.
Amid reports of stronger demand, there was signal of growth of new business orders at Indian services firms for the fifth month running in September. Job creation in the Indian service sector was seen for the first time in three months in September. Inflationary pressures eased further during the month.
Service sector inflationary pressures from inputs eased in September and were the most muted since November 2009, the survey said. Likewise, cost pressures in the manufacturing sector
softened in September, causing the overall rate of cost inflation to fall to the weakest level since April 2009.
In the last monetary policy, Reserve Bank governor Raghuram Rajan left all key rates unchanged citing continued risks to inflation and difficult external situation especially on the geopolitical front.
This is the fourth consecutive time that the RBI has kept key interest rates unaltered. The short-term lending rate (repo) rate remained at 8 percent, and the cash reserve requirement of banks at 4 percent.

This may have promptedRyanair planes' wingtips hit each other at Dublin Airport
Part of a wingtip on one of the planes was broken off in the incident
Ryanair jets collide at airport
Emergency services are at Dublin Airport after the wingtips of two Ryanair planes, one bound for Edinburgh and the other for Brussels, hit each other on a taxi-way.
Irish state broadcaster RTÉ has reported that the incident happened as one aircraft was taxiing to a stand.
No passengers were injured, and there was no disruption to any flights.
It is understood tenders from Dublin Fire Brigade were sent to the airport as a precautionary measure.
Glenn Jordan from Bangor, County Down, was one of the passengers caught up in the disruption.
Writing on Twitter, he said the collision had been "nothing too dramatic".
"Loud bang and the plane shook for a few seconds. Kept on board for over an hour though," he said in reply to a tweet.
In a post three hours later, he said: "About to board again #Ryanair hope the rear view mirror is clear and L plates are down #collision #dublinairport."
One passenger told RTÉ people on her flight remained on board for about an hour before being allowed off.
A spokesperson for the Dublin Airport Authority has said that the airport is fully operational, although there are "minor" delays to some flights.
She said the incident happened on a taxi-way area, and the main runways are not affected.
The two planes will remain in place until investigators from the Air Accident Unit arrive.
'Scraped the tail'
The other plane was also damaged
The spokesperson said this section of airport will be out of bounds for aircraft for a time, and will mean departing and arriving planes will take a slightly longer route to and from runways.
In a statement, Ryanair said: "Two of our aircraft were taxiing slowly to the runway at Dublin Airport this morning. The winglet of one aircraft appears to have scraped the tail of the other.
"There was no impact on customers on board. Ryanair has contacted the IAA and is working with them to return both aircraft to stand and allow normal operations at Dublin Airport to resume.
"Ryanair apologises sincerely to customers for any inconvenience."

In pics: Amidst tears and prayers  Jaya fan club waits for her releaseComments
It started in 1996 with Dr Subramanian Swamy filing a case against Jayalalithaa alleging her of having amassed proportions worth Rs. 66.5 crore, during her tenure as Tamil Nadu chief minister between 1991 and 1996.
After 18 long years, Amma was finally convicted in the disproportionate assets case on September 27. The AIADMK chief moved the Karnataka HC on September 30, seeking bail and challenging her conviction.
With Tamil Nadu in a frenzy and Amma's bail plea hearing due today, AIADMK workers continue to protest.
Jayalalithaa to walk out anytime now, release order reaches Bangalore jail
At first celebrations erupted when a rumour went out that the bail plea had been approved, but the mood soon turned sour as news of the bail plea getting rejected was confirmed.

Posters in Chennai which warned that Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu will be held hostage if AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa isn't released from prison caught media attention on Tuesday.

Four civilians injured in fresh violation of ceasefire by PakistanPakistan fires at 40 BSF posts in Jammu, protests at UN
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu, October 07, 2014
First Published: 07:57 IST(7/10/2014) | Last Updated: 19:13 IST(7/10/2014)

Pakistani mortars continued to pound villages along the Jammu border for a second straight day on Tuesday as they targeted 40 Border Security Force (BSF) posts in the region, wounding six civilians and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes.
 
BSF officials said Indian forces retaliated with gunfire and mortar bombs after Pakistan Rangers widened the range of their attacks to Poonch, Kanachak, Pargwal, Arnia, Akhnoor and RS Pura sectors, a day after mortar bombs killed five civilians and wounded 29 in the highest civilian death toll in a single day in more than a decade.

“Pakistan targeted 40 of our posts in RS Pura and Akhnoor sector without provocation,” said the BSF inspector general in Jammu, Rajesh Sharma. “We were then forced to fire back in equally strong measure.”
 
Media reports said the Indian and Pakistani DGMOs held talks on ceasefire violations and accused each other of violating the ceasefire.
 
India and Pakistan have been trading fire for about a week, straining India-Pakistan relations which hit a low after New Delhi called off foreign secretary-level talks in August following the Pakistani high commissioner’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders.
This year has been particularly volatile along the border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, which is due for assembly polls as Pakistan typically ratchets up border tensions every time the state holds elections.
 
Pakistan registered its protest with the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) over the firing by the Indian military along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
The BSF director general told HT on Tuesday Indian and Pakistani troops will likely continue shelling each other for a few more days, vowing to give a fitting reply in  the unexpected flare-up that has so far claimed 18 lives on both sides of the border.
 
Sartaj Aziz, Advisor to the Pakistan Prime Minister on National Security and Foreign Affairs, expressed concern over the situation along the Line of Control.
 
"The Indian government has not been able to restrain its forces despite strong diplomatic protest by Pakistan," he said.     "We call upon the Indian government to immediately cease fire and shelling and help us preserve tranquility," he said in a statement.
Aziz said the Pakistani government has been exercising "utmost restraint and responsibility”.
 
“We also extended a hand of friendship to India. However, with abrupt cancellation of foreign secretary-level talks, the Indian side has shunned all our peace overtures. We hope that the Indian side would give peace a chance," he said.
 
BSF sources said Pakistan was deliberately targeting Arnia town, which is about three kilometres from the border, to inflict maximum civilian causalities.
 
“Pakistan is firing about 1.5 km from behind the fence for effective firing. It’s also being done to move away from our radar of observation along the fence. The firing during the night is also the reason for it,” said a BSF official.
 
Home minister Rajnath Singh has urged Pakistan to stop violating the ceasefire attacks if it wants peace talks with India.
 
“We will not tolerate such acts of border violations. We are for peaceful relationship but not at the cost of security to our civilians,” Singh told HT on Monday.

It's the perfect initiative for the era of the three-breasted woman.
You know, the story late last month of the woman who supposedly had a third breast attached to make herself less attractive to men.
The ridiculous saga was — go figure — debunked, but not before it got plenty of attention on the Internet and on social media.
Well, Craig Silverman, who has spent much of his professional life countering erroneous journalism, is determined to do everything he can to help news organizations and news consumers alike separate fact from fiction.
That's why he recently launched Emergent , a website designed to track rumors and anonymously based stories as they, well, emerge on the Internet.
Emergent will analyze how news outlets are treating the stories and, most important, place them in one of three categories: confirmed true, confirmed false and unverified. And it will shift the classification as new facts come to the fore.
For example, when The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that Hewlett-Packard planned to split into two companies, citing unnamed sources, Emergent classified the story as not verified. But when the development was confirmed, it shifted into the confirmed true category.
So why did Silverman, who has been researching this issue at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism, create this new endeavor?
"There's a huge amount of misinformation spread online," he says. "A lot of things that are not true spread very quickly."
Years ago, if a news outlet broke a story, others would either ignore it or nail it down themselves before publishing. Today, in a world of fierce 24/7 competition, where everyone seems to think they need to have everything, and right away, if they are to stay relevant, it's common practice for news organizations to instantly post a story simply attributing it, to the outlet that published it. Then, hopefully, they work to make sure that it's true and then update their story.
But before the dust settles, a lot of erroneous information gets into play. And often stories from less-than-reliable outlets are uncritically disseminated. Remember the story that North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un had executed his uncle and onetime mentor by throwing him to a large pack of ferocious dogs? Completely bogus, but it got way further into to the mainstream than it should have.
Rieder: In which the news media go to the dogs
And all of these stories, not to mention a huge array of snippets of unverified information, are widely distributed on social media.
Silverman stresses that his new operation, which debuted in late September, is in its very early stages — "an initial prototype." He's on the Columbia payroll and has a research assistant there, but so far he's funding Emergent by himself.
Now he's turning his attention to the "sustainability piece." Possibilities include aggressive fundraising, becoming a stand-alone non-profit or finding a home at an existing news organization or foundation.
So how does Emergent work? With a mix of human and algorithmic intelligence. Silverman and company watch to see what rumor-fueled and unnamed source-based stories are rising to the surface. They put the stories into a database and assess how news outlets are treating them: as true, false or straight down the middle. They evaluate the headline as well as the story, because often the headlines lack the necessary qualifiers. And since headlines have so much impact, that's often how bad content enters the information bloodstream.
And, as mentioned above, Emergent decides how the overall meme should be categorized. And it watches how the stories evolve. Do news outlets update them as new information becomes available?
"News organizations often don't follow up," Silverman says.
Emergent also keeps an eye on at what stage stories are shared. Early findings suggest that the unverified first draft gets far more exposure than the debunking. Silverman hopes that ultimately, once Emergent catches on, people will check the site's conclusions before pulling the trigger and retweeting misinformation or sharing it on Facebook.
Silverman, who wrote both a blog and a book about journalism corrections called Regret the Error,  points out that many stories remain stuck in that unverified category. As Emergent grows, that will serve as an assignment desk for the new site. It will investigate on its own whether the stories are true.
So here's hoping Emergent gains traction. The war on disinformation needs all the help it can get.

Ballarpur Industries Gets $100 Million Investment from IFC
Reuters | Updated On: October 07, 2014 13:59 (IST)
Mumbai: Paper manufacturer Ballarpur Industries Ltd said on Tuesday International Finance Corp (IFC) agreed to buy new shares worth $100 million in its unit Bilt Paper BV.
Ballarpur shares rose more than 10 per cent in mid-day trading after the announcement.
The deal is at an implied pre-money valuation of $600 million for the unit and will result in IFC getting a 14.29 per cent stake in Bilt Paper BV, the company said in a statement.
The company is exploring the possibility of listing shares of Bilt Paper BV at an overseas stock exchange, it said.
Ballarpur had said last month that the board of IFC, the private-sector investment arm of the World Bank, had approved investments in the unit and that the funds would be used to repay existing debt.

Jayalalithaa fans  protest against conviction threatens democracy and the rule of lawOct 07, 2014 at 01:53pm IST
Jayalalithaa fans' protest against conviction threatens democracy and the rule of law

New Delhi: Tamil politicians and political workers have given an entirely new meaning to the word 'sycophancy'. Tens of thousands of people fasting and holding dharnas against the conviction of former Tamil Nadu chief minister and AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa across the state has shocked the people who believe in judiciary and the rule of law. Soon after a special court in Bangalore sent Jayalalithaa to jail in a disproportionate assets case for four years, passions have been running high across Tamil Nadu.
A day after Jayalalithaa was sent to the Bangalore Central Prison to serve her sentence as a convict, Tamil Nadu erupted in protest. The AIADMK ministers and MLAs cried in public demanding that she be released on bail. They actually led the protest violating the sacred oath they have taken in the name of teh Constitution by openly demanding her release.
After two days, the Tamil film industry held a day long fast and cinema theatres were closed in protest against the sentencing of Jayalalithaa. Jaya fans even blocked traffic across Tamil Nadu demanding the immediate release of 'Puratchi Thalaivi' or 'revolutionary leader' or their dear 'Amma'.
Tamil politicians and political workers have given an entirely new meaning to the word 'sycophancy'.
#jayalalithaa #tamil nadu #karnataka #aiadmk
The AIADMK-run city municipal corporations like Coimbatore and Chennai also openly joined the protest against her conviction. By taking the sycophancy to a new level, the AIADMK leaders even ate food served on the dirty floor at several places in Tamil Nadu in protest against Jaya's jailing.
What has shocked the public more is the sudden appearance of some posters in Chennai threatening to hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu hostages, if Jayalalithaa is not released on bail from Bangalore jail. The posters were removed after police stepped in.
These developments have sent shockwaves across the judiciary as this kind of protest against conviction by a court amounts to contempt of the court and punishable under the law.
The protestors must understand that Karnataka has nothing to do with the conviction of Jayalalithaa or her case. She has been convicted for looting the public money in Tamil Nadu. The case was transferred to neighbouring Karnataka by the Supreme Court to ensure a fair trial. The Karnataka government had no role to play in this decision.
After the Supreme Court ordered it to set up a special court to try Jayalalithaa and others in the corruption case, the Karnataka government followed the SC guidelines and instructions. In his judgement, the judge of the special court in Bangalore, John Michael D Cunha, has ordered Jayalalithaa to pay Rs 4 crore to Karnataka, which it spent on the special court.
Except these things, Karnataka has nothing to do with the case. The matter is now between Jayalalithaa and the judiciary and not between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. She is well within her rights to demand a transfer from Bangalore jail to a jail in Tamil Nadu. The Karnataka government, which is already finding it difficult to handle Jayalalithaa and her fans in Bangalore, will gladly agree to that.
The sycophantic Jayalalithaa fans must also understand that she is not in jail in a political case. She has been tried for over 16 years and the special court has convicted her after carefully going through all aspects of the case. She has the right to challenge her conviction in the Karnataka High Court and the Supreme Court. She will do that once she manages to get bail. Her fans must wait for the due legal procedures to take place, instead of protesting the jailing of their leader in this unconstitutional manner.
It may even turn things against her and she may not get bail for her partymen's and fans' illegal actions. The higher courts may not take these things lightly. Jaya fans have also set a very bad precedent. If every powerful convict's fans protest in the same way, it will lead to a total breakdown of Constitution and democracy in India.
Finally, Jayalalithaa and her fans must understand that, "Be you ever so high, the law is always above you." They are left with only one recourse, that is the legal recourse.

why Libor matters  click herePrint
Libor – what is it and why does it matter?
Libor, the London inter-bank lending rate, is considered to be one of the most important interest rates in finance, upon which trillions of financial contracts rest, and the exposure of its rigging has shocked many beyond the world of finance. Here, the BBC explains some of the key facts.
Continue reading the main story
1. What is Libor?
A global benchmark interest rate used to set a range of financial deals. It is also a measure of trust in the financial system and the faith banks have in each other's financial health.
Mortgages
of banks
2. Why is it important?
The Libor, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is used to set a range of financial transactions worth an estimated $300 trillion.
$300,000,000,000,000
Which is equivalent to approximately four and a half times global GDP
3. How is it set?
Every day a group of leading banks submit rates for 10 currencies and 15 lengths of loan ranging from overnight to 12 months.
The most important is the three-month dollar Libor. The rates submitted are what the banks estimate they would pay other banks to borrow dollars for three months. This is a simple example of how it works.
 
The top and bottom quartiles are discarded
1%
An average is calculated of the remainder
2.5% This is Libor
4. How was it rigged?
By traders
Since the rates submitted are estimates not actual transactions it's relatively easy to submit false figures.
Traders at several banks conspired to influence the Libor by getting colleagues to submit rates that were either higher or lower than their actual estimate.
Banks
3.5% Higher average
Libor and the financial crisis
At the height of the financial crisis in late 2007, many banks stopped lending to each other over concerns about their financial health with some banks submitting much higher rates than others.
Barclays was one of those submitting much higher rates, attracting some media attention. This prompted comment that Barclays was in trouble.
Following much internal debate and a controversial conversation with a Bank of England official, Barclays began to submit much lower rates. You can see this in the graph below which compares the Libor rate with those submitted by Barclays.
Barclays' Libor 3-month sterling submissions vs daily Libor fix
5. Consequences
The Libor scandal has further undermined trust in banks. The deputy governor of the Bank of England called the Libor market a "cesspit".
While those paying interest on loans would have benefited from lower Libor rates, savers and investors would have lost out.
Regulators in Canada, US, Japan, Switzerland, Britain are investigating the rate rigging.
Lawsuits have been launched by US municipalities, pension funds and hedge funds.
Note: The estimated figure for the value of transactions connected to Libor has been revised down from $800 trillion following new figures in the Wheatley report on 28 September 2012.

The manufacture of transport equipment has achieved strong growth rates in recent years compared with other manufacturing sub-sectors and historical trends.
According to the Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07) the transport equipment sub-sector is defined as the production of motor vehicles (both parts and whole vehicles) and other transport equipment such as ships, boats, aircraft and bicycles among others.
Recent strength in this sub-sector provides a stark contrast compared to its performance prior to the recent economic downturn. From 1969 to 2007 (see Figure 7), the volume of transport equipment produced grew by just 0.5% per annum; compared with a figure of 2.6% for GDP growth. This resulted in the transport equipment sub-sector accounting for a gradually smaller share of the whole economy, falling to 1.2% of total output in 2007 from 2.1% in 1997; but with a broadly stable proportion of the total manufacturing industry (around 11%).
During the 2008/09 economic downturn the transport equipment sub-sector experienced the sharpest fall in output for more than forty years. Output fell by 27.5% between April 2008 and February 2009, reaching the levels previously experienced in 1995. In comparison, the economic downturns in the 1990s and 1980s experienced smaller falls in output (14% and 20% respectively).
While the fall in output was the most severe in more than forty years, the subsequent recovery has been the strongest with the volume of output currently 23.5% above Q1 2008 levels. This may partly be attributed to a strong export performance; with the volume of car exports currently 49% higher compared with the pre-downturn levels. The domestic consumption of motor vehicles is another factor, currently 5.1% higher compared with pre-downturn levels experienced in Q1 2008.

The Index of Production release for September 2014, to be published on Thursday 6 November 2014, will have a revisions period back to July 2014.
Code of Practice for Official Statistics
National Statistics are produced to high professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics . They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference.
Understanding the data
Short guide to the Index of Production
This statistical bulletin gives details of the index of output of the production industries in the United Kingdom. Index numbers of output in this statistical bulletin are on the base 2011=100 and are classified to the 2007 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). The production industries, which accounted for 14.6% of gross domestic product in 2011, cover mining & quarrying (Section B), manufacturing (Section C), gas & electric (Section D), and water supply & sewerage (Section E).
Interpreting the data
The non-seasonally adjusted series contain elements relating to the impact of the standard reporting period, moving holidays and trading day activity. When making comparisons it is recommended that users focus on seasonally adjusted estimates as these have the seasonal effects and systematic calendar related components removed.
Figures for the most recent months are provisional and subject to revision in light of (a) late responses to surveys and administrative sources and (b) revisions to seasonal adjustment factors which are re-estimated every month and reviewed annually (changes from the latest review are included in this release).
Definitions and explanations
Definitions found within the main statistical bulletin are listed:
Chained volume measure
An index number from a chain index of quantity. The index number for the reference period of the index may be set equal to 100 or to the estimated monetary value of the item in the reference period.
Index number
A measure of the average level of prices, quantities or other measured characteristics relative to their level for a defined reference period or location. It is usually expressed as a percentage.
Seasonally adjusted
Seasonal adjustment aids interpretation by removing effects associated with the time of the year or the arrangement of the calendar, which could obscure movements of interest.
Use of the data
The IoP is a key economic indicator and one of the earliest short-term measures of economic activity. The main output is a seasonally adjusted estimate of total production and broad sector groupings of mining & quarrying, manufacturing, energy and water supply & sewerage. The total IoP estimate and various breakdowns are widely used in private and public sector institutions, particularly the Bank of England, Her Majesty’s Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility, to assist in informed policy and decision making.
Methods
An article about the Index of Production methodology (78.4 Kb Pdf) is available on the Office for National Statistics website .
Composition of the data
The Index of Production uses a variety of different data from sources which are produced on either a quarterly or monthly basis.
Most of the series are derived using current price turnover deflated by a suitable price index. This includes the Monthly Business Survey (MBS) data; an ONS short-term survey of various industries in the economy. It is one of the main data sources used in the compilation of the Index of Production.
Seasonal adjustment
The index numbers in this statistical bulletin are all seasonally adjusted. This aids interpretation by removing annually recurring fluctuations, for example, due to holidays or other regular seasonal patterns. Unadjusted data are also available.
Seasonal adjustment removes regular variation from a time series. Regular variation includes effects due to month lengths, different activity near particular events such as shopping activity before Christmas, and regular holidays such as the May bank holiday. Some features of the calendar are not regular each year, but are predictable if we have enough data - for example the number of certain days of the week in a month may have an effect, or the impact of the timing of Easter. As Easter changes between March and April we can estimate its effect on time series and allocate it between March and April depending on where Easter falls. Estimates of the effects of day of the week and Easter are used respectively to make trading day and Easter adjustments prior to seasonal adjustments.
Although leap years only happen every four years, they are predictable and regular and their impact can be estimated. Hence, if there is a leap year effect, it is removed as part of regular seasonal adjustment.
Deflation
It is common for the value of a group of financial transactions to be measured in several time periods. The values measured will include both the change in the volume sold and the effect of the change of prices over that year. Deflation is the process whereby the effect of price change is removed from a set of values.
All series, unless otherwise quoted, are chained volume measures. Deflators adjust the value series to take out the effect of price change to give the volume series.
Quality
Basic quality information
A common pitfall in interpreting data is that expectations of accuracy and reliability in early estimates are often too high. Revisions are an inevitable consequence of the trade off between timeliness and accuracy. Early estimates are based on incomplete data.
Very few statistical revisions arise as a result of ‘errors’ in the popular sense of the word. All estimates, by definition, are subject to statistical ‘error’ but in this context the word refers to the uncertainty inherent in any process or calculation that uses sampling, estimation or modelling. Most revisions reflect either the adoption of new statistical techniques, or the incorporation of new information which allows the statistical error of previous estimates to be reduced. Only rarely are there avoidable ‘errors’ such as human or system failures, and such mistakes are made quite clear when they do occur.
ONS plans to update the IoP standard errors analysis last carried out in 2006 to take account of the new standard industrial classification (SIC07) which was implemented in 2011. This work is reliant upon the availability of expert resources, but it is hoped to begin this work in September 2014, with an estimated completion date of the end of March 2015.
Quality and methodology information report
A quality and methodology information report for this Statistical Bulletin can now be found on the ONS website .
Revision triangles
One indication of the reliability of the key indicators in this bulletin can be obtained by monitoring the size of revisions. The table below is based on the revisions which have occurred over the last five years. Please note that these indicators only report summary measures for revisions. The revised data may, themselves, be subject to sampling or other sources of error.
Table 4 presents a summary of the differences between the first estimates published between September 2008 and August 2013 and the estimates published 12 months later.

Nokia to Shut Down Chennai Factory From November 1You are here: Home Corporates
Nokia to Shut Down Chennai Factory From November 1
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 07, 2014 23:33 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
New Delhi: Telecom gear maker Nokia on Tuesday said that it will shut down its Chennai plant from November 1 as Microsoft has terminated mobile purchase agreement from the factory and it is left with no business.
"Microsoft has informed Nokia that it will be terminating the manufacturing services defined in the agreement with effect from 1 November 2014. In absence of further orders from Microsoft, Nokia will suspend handset production at the Sriperumbudur facility from 1st November," Nokia said in a statement.
In September 2013, Nokia announced it would sell its devices and services (D&S) business including assets in India to Microsoft for $7.2 billion by March 2014.
The deal was completed on April 25 but Chennai facility could not be transferred to Microsoft because of legal issues related to tax demand by Indian government.
Nokia started manufacturing in Chennai in January 2006 and exported to markets including in the Middle East and Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand from there.
In March, the Tamil Nadu government served a Rs 2,400 crore notice on Nokia, saying the firm had also sold products from the Chennai plant in the domestic market instead of shipping them overseas.
In a separate tax case, the Supreme Court had ordered Nokia India on March 14 to provide a Rs 3,500 crore guarantee before it transfers the plant to Microsoft.
As a consequence, Nokia entered into a transitional services agreement with Microsoft to address their immediate production needs and keep the factory operational.
"Unfortunately, the continuing asset freeze imposed by the tax department prevents Nokia from exploring potential opportunities for the transfer of the factory to a successor to support the long term viability of the established, fully functional electronics manufacturing ecosystem," the statement said.
Nokia said that it will be informing all stakeholders including the Labour Commissioner of the suspension.
"As a responsible employer, Nokia is currently evaluating options to minimise the impact on existing employees at the manufacturing facility. It will share further information once details have been finalised," Nokia said.
The exact number of employees at present in its Chennai factory could not be ascertained but in March, out of 6,600 permanent employees, about 5000 had opted for a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) offered by Nokia.
According to union officials, majority of employees at the factory are women. The plant was also providing employment to 10,000 people indirectly in the Sriperumbudur region.
The plant became one of the landmarks in the Sriperumbudur industrial belt as it was one of the few companies apart from auto maker Hyundai Motor India to set up plant, employing large number of people.
"Production of phones like Asha range has shifted to other countries and the plant which was operating in three shifts has come down to two shifts," union sources said.
The factory also witnessed tense moments post the deal with Microsoft as several employees who were working at the unit since it began operations in 2006 staged protests urging the management to include them on the payroll of Microsoft.
About 3,000 employees affiliated to Nokia India Thozhilalargal Sangam (Nokia India Employees Union) staged a one-day fast in Chennai early this year, seeking to draw the attention of the central and state governments to their plight.
Nokia also offered 'Bridge initiative' offering consultancy services and employment outlook training besides providing the VRS.

Weak German Output Numbers Send Europe Into ReverseYou are here: Home Market
Weak German Output Numbers Send Europe Into Reverse
Reuters | Updated On: October 07, 2014 14:31 (IST)
Gold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
London: A second day of weak German data sent European markets into retreat on Tuesday with stocks, the euro and periphery euro zone government debt all knocked by the mounting evidence of an abrupt slowdown in the bloc's economic engine room.
A day after German industrial orders saw their biggest monthly drop since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009, its industrial output figures for August plunged by 4.0 per cent, also the biggest fall in five years.
"Industrial production is currently going through a weak phase... but the current decline is exacerbated by holiday effects," Germany's Economy Ministry said in a statement.
"All in all, one should expect weak production for the third quarter as a whole."
By contrast, the mining sector was boosted as Rio Tinto rose 5.2 per cent after saying it rejected a merger approach from smaller rival Glencore Plc to create a $160 billion mining and trading giant in August.
Asian shares had made minor gains overnight but the weak data saw European bourses jolt lower, led by a 0.7 per cent drop on Germany's Dax which has now lost 7.5 per cent in the last three weeks.
London, Paris, Milan and Madrid all took tumbles, while Italian, Spain, Portuguese and also French government bonds yields rose amid doubts about what a slowing Germany meant for their more fragile economies.
Germany's and the euro zone's renewed weakness is part of broader worldwide picture. Apart from the United States, indicators of global growth have slipped sharply over the past few months.
Economists at Barclays highlighted on Tuesday that their global manufacturing index is at its lowest level since May and the IMF is expected to cut back its growth forecasts later.
"Over the summer, there has been quite an apparent divergence in the global growth story," said Kerry Craig, a global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan.
"What we are seeing is quite an ugly and uneven recovery. Growth in euro zone has stalled... and then you have to contrast that with what is going on in the U.S. where we saw the really strong jobs data on Friday."
Yen effects
The euro also weakened slightly after the German data, though with traders still looking for an excuse to take some profits on the dollar's recent surge, the dip was only minor.
At the same time, the dollar was struggling versus the yen after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised the negatives as well as positives of a weaker yen for his country's economy.
It had been a choppy session but the outcome was that after going as high as 109.25 yen, the dollar was back down at 108.62 yen as Asia trading started to tail off.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last up about 0.4 per cent, after wobbling between positive and negative territory though the higher yen meant Tokyo's Nikkei ended the day firmly in the red.
The dollar's weakness helped, however, bolster recently slumping commodity prices.
Brent oil was steady in early London trading at $92.62 a barrel alongside growth-attuned copper, while gold held above $1,200 an ounce.
The Reserve Bank of Australia held its cash rate steady at 2.5 per cent at its regular policy review on Tuesday, and said that its currency remains high by historical standards.
The Australian dollar erased earlier gains and slipped about 0.3 per cent to $0.8738, moving back towards Friday's low of $0.8642 which was its weakest level since July 2010.

Small rooftop solar power plants alone are likely to create 3.25 lakh jobs cumulatively in the next ten years in India, says a report.
“The small rooftop scenario (sector) would contribute the most to job creation, with around 3,25,000 cumulative new jobs in next ten years,” a report by Bridge to India, a company engaged in businesses like Strategic Consulting, Market Intelligence and Project Development, said.
The supply chain for small rooftop systems would include many intermediaries, spreading margins across more layers, it said.
The report divided the solar power sector into four segments - small rooftops, large rooftops, utility scale projects and ultra mega projects.
The average size of a small rooftop solar is 3 KWp (kilowatt peak), the power achieved by a solar module under full solar radiation. The average size of a large scale rooftop is 250 KWp, utility scale project 20 MW and that of ultra mega solar scheme is 1,000 MWp or 1 GWp.
In large rooftop systems, around 2.20 lakh cumulative jobs and in the utility scale scenario around 71,000 cumulative jobs will be created in the next 10 years.
The report added that the least number of jobs will be created in the ultra mega scale category. The total number of jobs in this scenario comes to only around 63,000 in ten years.
The general policy recommendations to enable the sector to grow under any of the four scenarios is creating transparent and dependable solar policies to encourage Indian and international investment.
They also include making available better financing instruments whether related to the end-consumer or infrastructure finance, making the electricity market more competitive and transparent with respect to power tariffs and grid usage and rules.
At present, the country’s installed solar power capacity stands at about 2,600 MW. The government has plans to scale this capacity up to 20,000 MW by 2022.

Why do you want a ban on Haidermore photos »
Last weekend, I watched Vishal Bhardwaj’s Haider . It’s been three days since then but still I can’t figure out why some people want to ban/boycott this wonderful film.
I searched the social media for explanations and this page -- Boycott Haider -- popped up. The main grouse of the protesters seems to be this: "Haider is a pro-Pakistani film and it "insults" the Indian Army.
There are no owner details on the FB page (no surprises here) but a tagline on the cover photo gives an insight into the owner/owners’ mindset and affiliations: “I am a patriot, I am a Nationalist, I am a born Hindu” (henceforth PNH). Another member of the PNH brigade has a cracker of a suggestion on how to hit the film where it is sure to hurt, at the box office. The PNH writes on the Boycott Haider page, "We must incentivise watching of a patriotic film like Bang Bang by sponsoring tickets for those who are ready to #BoycottHaider!" Truly creative, I must say.
Also watch: Haider is not your regular Bollywood film
video platform video management video solutions video player
It is true that the Haider does not depict the Indian Army the way the PNHs would like it to be: a benevolent force that can do no wrong. Probably, PNHs want soldiers to carry roses, not guns, in films. Even at the risk of being called "sickular" and several other unimaginative names, let me put it straight: while I believe that the Indian Army is one of the best forces in the world, has done/is doing a lot for the country, is one of the two institutions that still work in this country (the other being the judiciary) and must be respected, one must also accept that the Indian Army’s track record is not without blemish. This holds true for our paramilitary forces and police as well. In fact, no army in the world has a blot-free resume simply because of the kind of job they are expected to do.
Also read: Haider will hurt and haunt you
In Kashmir, as the film shows, the Indian Army countered terror with its own methods against Pakistan-funded and trained terrorists, supported and used Ikhwanis (who provided intelligence/local knowledge/information about militants to them) and of course, the men in uniform used horrendous tactics to extract information and many a times, made mistakes in identifying the real terrorists and ended up killing innocent people.
Here’s an interesting piece by an officer who served in the Valley in the early 1990s, when militancy was in its peak in the state: http://read.ht/jlj . There is no byline -- the author probably doesn’t want to betray the force he served (which is just as well) -- but doesn’t mince words when he agrees with what the film has shown.
And why talk about Kashmir only? Fortified with the dreaded Armed Forces Special Powers Act, the paramilitary forces have had -- and still do -- several run-ins with citizens in the Northeast also. Remember the photograph of Manipuri women who took to the streets naked to protest against the rape and killing Manorama by soldiers? In Chhattisgarh’s Maoist areas, where the CRPF operates, there have been hundreds of cases of abuse by the men in jackboots. Some are documented, some are not.
It’s high time that people start accepting the reality that places like MAMA II (interrogation centre) existed in Kashmir and its variants still flourish in other parts of the country. Whether one should support such strong-arm tactics or not; whether the Army was/is right in doing so (considering the tough situation it was working under and the brief it got from New Delhi) are a matter of debate and individual opinion.
But as far as the movie is concerned, the director did nothing wrong in showing these incidents in the film. Can a film on holocaust be shown without the gas chambers or the torture scenes? The same attitude (disbelief and anger whenever something goes against the standard belief system), is also seen when the personal lives of Indian political leaders are depicted candidly in movies. While it is okay to show them corrupt and scheming, all hell breaks loose if they are seen in the company their lovers/girlfriends.
It’s high time we realise that we need to confront many truths regarding the Indian Army’s conduct, however uncomfortable they are, and accepting that truth does not make anyone unpatriotic in any way.

Nokia to shut down Chennai factory from Nov 1Nokia to close its Chennai manufacturing plant from November 1

Massacre of civilians feared as Islamic State nears Turkish border

(Anwar Muslim, a coordinator for…)
By Karam Shoumali and Anne Barnard
ISTANBUL: Islamic State militants pushed on Monday into the eastern edge of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani on the Turkish border, after sustained shelling that drove back the Kurdish fighters and Syrian insurgents fighting alongside them, killing 16 and raising fears of a massacre of civilians, Kurdish fighters and activists said.
Anwar Muslim, a coordinator in Kobani for the People's Protection Committees, a Kurdish militant group known as the YPG, said Monday night that 12,000 civilians were trapped inside the town. He said that his group was running out of heavy ammunition, and with Islamic State militants close by the population was in constant fear of car bombs or suicide bombers.
Rooz Bahjat, who identified himself as a senior security official with the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq, said that as many as 9,000 Islamic State fighters were closing in on the area, leaving other fronts in eastern and northern Syria and even as far away as Iraq to attack what he called "a bastion of democracy and secularism" in Kobani, which has given shelter to internally displaced Syrians from a wide range of ethnic groups.
"The whole might of ISIS right now is turned onto Kobani," he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIL.
His information could not be independently verified, but Kurdish officials have been warning for days that without more military aid, Kobani will fall. And Islamic State fighters in Raqqa and Aleppo provinces have said in recent interviews that they were redeploying toward Kobani after having faced US-led airstrikes in their strongholds elsewhere in Syria.
The Kurdish militants have been hanging on as fighters from the Islamic State have advanced with heavy weapons in a three-week assault. Kurdish women have joined the battle, and one, Kurdish and Syrian activists say, blew herself up with a grenade over the weekend rather than be captured. Shells have sailed across the Turkish border several times in recent days, and on Monday a black Islamic State flag appeared to be flying from one of the taller buildings in Kobani or Ayn al-Arab as it is known in Arabic, the main settlement in a group of Kurdish farming villages that has been under assault since mid-September.
Video from the front lines in recent days has shown fighters for the Islamic State advancing across fields in formation, well equipped in camouflage flak vests. Some militants have posted pictures of themselves holding the severed heads of what they say are female Kurdish fighters.
The Kurds are cut off from supply lines and surrounded by Islamic State fighters on three sides. The fourth, the Turkish border, is heavily guarded by Turkish forces, which have prevented Turkish and Syrian Kurds from joining the fight.
Turkish army patrols watching from across a border fence have remained spectators to the fighting, even though on Monday the NATO alliance said it would aid Turkey, a member state, if it came under attack.
"Turkey should know that NATO will be there if there is any spillover, any attacks on Turkey as a consequence of the violence we see in Syria," Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of the alliance, said Monday.
Turkish officials have said they will assist in the fight against the Islamic State, but given Turkey's open border policy that long facilitated the movement of the extremist militants into Syria, Kurds are suspicious of its intentions. They say that Turkey views the semiautonomous Kurdish region that has developed on the Syrian side of the border as the greater threat.
  Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, told media on Monday that Turkey was ready to take many military measures, including sending ground troops to Syria, but that there needed to be "a clear strategy." Turkish officials were disappointed that President Barack Obama did not make the ouster of President Bashar Assad of Syria a goal of the operation against the Islamic State, and have demanded an internationally backed no-fly zone to keep Syrian jets out of the air before taking new military action. Airstrikes by the US-led coalition against the Islamic State took out two of the group's positions south of Kobani on Monday, the US military said. But as Kurdish fighters pleaded for more support, the only other airstrikes on the militant group Monday were conducted elsewhere, in Raqqa and Deir el-Zour provinces.
Syrian insurgents opposed to the Islamic State have vowed to step up cooperation with the YPG, but the Syrians do not have a strong presence in the area. The Turkish government was initially reluctant to take strong action against the Islamic State after it overran Mosul and large areas of northern Iraq in August, citing the need to safeguard 46 Turkish hostages being held by the militant group. But the hostages were freed last month in a deal that has raised further questions about the relationship between Turkey and the Islamic State.

Retail investors  brace for a volatile October! | Why market was lukewarm to Modi s US tripRetail investors should brace for a volatile October, say analysts
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 7, 2014, 04.02PM IST
(The block de-allocation…)
NEW DELHI: After a muted September, analysts are eyeing the volatile October as market participants are awaiting India Inc's report card for the quarter ended September 2014 as well as key macro-economic data.
The S&P BSE Sensex closed on a muted note, down 56 points, for the month of September. Domestic issues such as coal block de-allocation and fading hopes of a rate hike in 2015 kept the markets under pressure.
The block de-allocation is hurting banks having exposure to the affected companies. Global factors are also weak with revival in China required to boost global growth.
Early rate hike fears in the US are also adding to the fear in the market. The Euro zone inflation remains at lower levels and growth under stress, say experts.
"Keeping in mind the last month's closing, I broadly expect a volatile month with bias on the negative side as we have less number of trading sessions due to the festive session break, but a lot more depends upon how the earnings season shapes up," said Ajit Mishra, AVP- Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
"The indicator of volatility i.e. India VIX, mostly witnessed a declining trend during the October month, but the situation is different this time as it has recently formed a new 52-week low and rebounded thereafter," he added.
Mishra is of the view that it is important for a retail investor to understand that volatility is negatively correlated to the markets. It means rise in volatility may result in further decline in the index in the coming month. So participants should plan their trading and investment strategies accordingly, he added.
The markets are witnessing profit booking after the recent run up. The S&P BSE Sensex has rallied nearly 26 per cent so far in the year 2014.
"October can be considered as a volatile month and India VIX, which suggests the level of fear or uncertainty in the market, shows that huge swing could be seen this month," said Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
"Hence, either side movement has been observed on the Nifty in the past 10 years. As the strength in the market remains intact, easing global pressures and developments by the government can give a boost to the markets," he added.
Analysts attribute the current weakness more because of technical factors and absence of follow up buying. Since retail frenzy has not yet kicked in, dominant players remain the professional investors who may be cagey to buy at such high PE multiples, they say.
"Our assessment is that at present levels, there is little margin of safety and either equities correct or earnings have to surprise on the upside. That is the simple equation," said Dipan Mehta, Member, BSE and NSE.
"October could be volatile as earnings will take centre stage. There is also the Maharashtra state election which may impact sentiment," he added.
Mehta is of the view that if the BJP/Narendra Modi popularity is ebbing, then the markets may view this as an impediment to taking unpopular decisions which are much needed to address certain structural problems in our economy. The inverse is also true.

Is your portfolio limping through the year? Wonder if you’re really a good stock picker, or just lucky? New software is designed to help you answer these questions.
You’d think they’d be easily answered in the digital era. But it’s surprisingly not the case. So Intuit has released the latest version of its money-monitoring software, Quicken 2015, to try to change that.
Quicken 2015 tries to make itself more like dessert by moving away from just counting your money to helping you make sense of it. It’s definitely a move in the right direction — and a good solution for some — but further advancements are needed to make it truly a killer app for most.
Quicken has long been the broccoli of the financial world. Investors and consumers know they should use something like it or something similar to track their money – but somehow they get distracted by other things.
In this day and age of online brokerages and smartphone apps, Quicken might seem like a bit of a throwback. And in some ways, using Quicken to simply track one’s money and where it’s going has been replaced for many by other options. Bank and brokerage websites, apps, and third-party financial sites like Mint and SigFig have taken over many of the basic tasks. Brokerages are now required to track investment cost basis — which was one of the core reasons investors would use Quicken.
With the latest upgrade to Quicken, Intuit shows it recognizes simply downloading financial data isn’t going to cut it anymore. Quicken is for investors who need the most power, the most detailed reports and the most flexibility — especially for investors with accounts scattered among different banks and brokerages.
Quicken is for people who are serious about their money — and it needs to up its game a bit to stay ahead of competition that’s largely free to use. Intuit seems to recognize this. It’s starting to inch in the direction of providing insight — and away from just tracking transactions.
By far, the most noteworthy addition to Quicken in 2015 is the Portfolio X-Ray, only available in the “Premier” version of the software or even higher-end ones such as Home & Business and Rental Property Manager. Once you’ve downloaded your brokerage information to Quicken, you can press a button and run your holdings through Morningstar’s well-regarded X-Ray Interpreter engine.
The X-Ray Interpreter does much of the data crunching you might normally expect to get from a financial planner. You’ll see how much of your portfolio ins in cash, bonds, US stocks or foreign stocks. The software also displays which parts of the world and industries you’re most exposed to.
But the X-Ray goes even deeper, telling you key elements about your portfolio such as the P-E ratio of the collection of stocks and how that stack sup with the S&P 500. You can also see the Morningstar “style box,” which shows how much of your money is in small, medium, large and value and growth stocks. You can also get a list of your biggest holdings. The X-Ray will also evaluate the investment fees you’re paying.
Sure. You can get a free X-Ray analysis from Morningstar.com. But you’d either need to sign up for Morningstar’s Premium subscription at $199 a year — or to enter all your holdings manually each time you’d like an X-Ray. The “Premier” edition of Quicken, geared for investors, is also the most expensive with a price at most retailers of about $75.
There are some other additions to Quicken 2015. There’s a tool to get your credit score, for free. The software is also improved to better handle options trades. Quicken also introduces an Intuit ID — which is a password used to lock up all your account information.
Still, there are some strange omissions and annoyances. Users are still not able to create an Investing allocation report that breaks their portfolio into large, mid-sized, small, value and growth holdings. This needs to be fixed so it matches the results of the Morningstar X-Ray.
And while there’s a mobile version of Quicken, it’s shockingly limited. The app only allows you to do the most basic tasks when away from your PC –such as entering transactions or viewing balances. Let’s hope Intuit finally gives users a dedicated Windows store app that would run on a PC as well as a tablet and smartphone, which would give them more control while still offering mobility.
Pros:
* Quicken is still more powerful than just about any other money-tracking software, website or app available.
* Software doesn’t have an ulterior motive, such as gathering personal data or forwarding contact information for a sales pitch. You buy it and it’s yours.
* Data is stored locally, giving users control and less security concerns.
* Premier version gives customized access to Morningstar X-Ray.
* Outstanding ability to give users a centralized picture of their entire financial picture.
* Free credit score is convenient enough that users might actually use it.
Cons:
* Still requires setting up somewhat complicated connections with banks and brokerages.
* Morningstar X-Ray only available in Premier edition or two other more costly versions.
* Downloads stop working in product after a few years unless you upgrade again.
* Mobile apps are shockingly limited in features.
* $75 price tag for Premier version, which includes the investor features.
The bottom line:
Quicken is still the best option around for serious investors with complex portfolios scattered across different banks and brokerages. Quicken 2015 makes the case for pro investors that much stronger. Few places can give users a complete view of all their accounts in such detail — including precise details about taxes and cost basis. Quicken 2015 also moves in the right direction — attempting to offer insights and advice, over simply tracking. The reports could be improved — especially the asset allocation report — but overall are still better than you’ll get anywhere else.
But Quicken is overkill for beginning investors with just a single brokerage account. Intuit’s own Mint.com or SigFig are easier to set up and more similar to what users expect today in terms of presentation. Quicken needs to offer even more compelling insights to make it worth the learning curve for beginning investors or those not as comfortable with technology.

USA TODAY
Companies start revealing their third-quarter profit growth in just a few days. But savvy investors already know which stocks have the best chance for big-time profit growth.
There are seven stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 including real-estate firm Host Hotels & Resorts (HST) , energy company Tesoro (TSO) and biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) that Wall Street analysts are expecting to deliver 100% or greater profit growth for the third quarter, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Hopes are high for these companies’ profit growth. If analysts are right, these companies will absolutely blow away the 6.8% profit growth expected from the S&P 500 during the quarter, S&P Capital IQ says.
When it comes to great profit growth expectations, no other company can match up to hotel property management firm Host Hotels. The company has been on the vanguard of the industry’s move to reduce their business of owning hotels and shift more to a business model of managing franchisees and collecting lucrative license fees. The strategy is paying off big-time this quarter with profit growth. Analysts are calling for the company to post adjusted profit of 9 cents a share, up 800% from the same period last year.
Another company expected to report eye-popping earnings growth is Gilead Sciences. The biotech firm with breakthrough treatments for everything from liver disease to hypertension is expected to deliver adjusted quarterly profit of $1.89 a share. If the analysts are right, that would be profit growth of 263%. That might seem to be an impossible hurdle until you realize the company actually delivered even-higher 372% profit growth in the second quarter.
Perhaps more surprisingly is the huge expectation for Tesoro, an energy firm. Despite falling oil prices, analysts are still incredibly optimistic for what the company can deliver in terms of earnings growth for the quarter. Analysts see the company earning an adjusted 44 cents a share during the quarter, up 295% from the same-year-ago period.
But with great expectations comes great responsibility. With expectations for these companies so high already, it makes it that much higher to beat views. And during earnings season, investors are usually most impressed with the companies that manage to do better than expected, even though not much was expected.
Keep in mind, too, that these expectations are disseminated and priced into investors’ valuations of the stocks. High hopes for future profits often create high valuations. All but one of the stocks, Health Care REIT (HCN) are rated “outperform” by the average Wall Street analysts.
But five of the seven stocks already have “dangerously” high prices, according to New Constructs , a stock research firm that compares stocks’ current value with the current value of future cash flows. The two stocks with lukewarm “neutral” ratings are Gilead and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) .
It won’t be long before investors see if these companies can meet — or better yet beat — the sky-high expectations set for them.
Below are the seven stocks in the S&P 500 that are expected to deliver 100% or greater adjusted earnings growth:

Senior banker pleadsBanker admits Libor fraud conspiracy
Financial institutions in London and New York have settled regulatory allegations of rigging Libor
Explaining the Libor scandal
A senior banker from a UK bank has admitted conspiring to defraud over manipulating the Libor lending rate.
The banker, who can not be named for legal reasons, is the first person in the UK to plead guilty to the offence.
Two men have already pleaded guilty in the US to fraud offences linked to the rigging of Libor, for years the benchmark by which trillions of pounds of financial contracts are based.
The case arose from the Serious Fraud Office 's (SFO) investigations.
It began looking into Libor manipulation in 2012 after it emerged that it was being widely abused by leading banks to manipulate rates in their favour.
New laws
The economic secretary to the Treasury, Andrea Leadsom, said: "The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. Ensuring that the key rates that underpin financial markets are robust, and that anyone who seeks to manipulate them is subject to the full force of the law is vital."
The government started consulting on new laws to ensure that markets are fair two weeks ago.
It would like to create a new criminal offence for the attempted manipulation of Libor, and extend any new legislation to cover seven other major financial benchmarks.
The SFO's investigation continues and 11 other individuals stand charged and await trial.
Seven banks and brokerages have settled regulatory allegations of interest rate rigging in the UK and the US after global investigations.
So far, 17 men have been charged with fraud-related offences.
Last month, Lloyds Banking Group dismissed eight staff members following an investigation into the behaviour of its rate setters.
The move follows the bank's £218m fine in July for "serious misconduct" over the setting of Libor.

Providing further corroboration that the auto industry is benefiting from early signs on an economic revival, domestic passenger vehicle sales for the auto industry as a whole rose 4.68 percent to 2.18 lakh units in September (from 2.06 lakh in the same month last year).
This was the third straight month of increases for the industry as a whole, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.
Within companies, Asian firms ( Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai, Honda and Nissan) continued their strong showing in the Indian market while American and European companies (Chevrolet, Ford, Renault, Volkswagen and Fiat) witnessed their market share come off, compared to a year ago.
While leaders Maruti and Hyundai continue to launch one successful product after another, Honda’s successful re-launch of the City (with a first-time diesel-engine option for a Honda car) this year has helped the company increase its sales dramatically compared to last year.
In terms of domestic market share, Maruti remained the clear leader at 45.71 percent, while Korean firm Hyundai remains firmly ensconced in the second place at 16.02 percent. However, utility vehicles maker Mahindra (8.76 percent) has reclaimed the third-place spot that it had conceded to Honda (6.86) three months ago.
The list of the top-10 selling cars is dominated by Maruti (six models) and Hyundai (three), with the only vehicle not belonging to these two companies being Mahindra’s Bolero. The city hatch, Alto, is back in the first place, overtaking the Dzire that topped last month.
Segment-wise analysis:
City hatch: Maruti Suzuki Alto remains the clear leader, notching up close to 20,000 sales while Hyundai Eon is a firm but distant second. The Datsun Go appears to have lost its way after a distant start while the Tata Nano continues to sell in fits and starts.
Compact hatch: The Wagon R remains the clear leader here and the Grand i10, which till recently threatened to become the segment leader, has lost some steam. The semi-automatic Celerio has also achieved blockbuster status, consistently notching more than 5,000 unit sales for a few months now. The workhorse Santro continues to sell well despite its age (and despite some reports saying it would be phased out soon). But sales of the Beat have fallen by more than half over the period of a year.
Premium hatch: The action is heating up in this segment, with the Elite i20 (which replaced the earlier i20 variant in July) witnessing increasingly high buying interest even as the Swift continues to rule the roost here. The i20’s gains appear to have come at the cost of the Ritz, another steady seller since a few years. (Note: Cars selling below 1,000 units – Skoda Fabia, Renault Pulse, Chevrolet U-VA, Fiat Punto -- have not been included in the chart below).
Compact sedan: In the fast-selling compact sedan segment, the Dzire remains the clear leader, while recent launches Hyundai Xcent and Tata Zest continue to notch up respectable sales. The Honda Amaze appears to have taken a bit on the chin due to the new entrants.
Midsize sedan: After what appears to be a production blip last month, the fourth-generation Honda City launched earlier this year is back to rule the charts -- selling close to 5,000 units -- at the cost of rival Hyundai Verna. Analysts will however look forward keenly to the fortunes of Maruti Ciaz, which sold 1,375 units (to dealers) and is the market leader’s third – and most serious -- attempt at cracking this segment, after the Baleno and SX4. (Note: Cars selling less than 1000 units -- Ford Fiesta, Nissan Sunny, Chevrolet SAIL, Fiat Linea, Mahindra Verito, Renault Scala -- have not been included in the chart below.)
Utility vehicles: The segment has long been dominated by the Bolero even as Ertiga and Innova, too, have been selling about 5,000 units. The latest entrant, Mobilio, is off to a robust start as well. (Sales of Gypsy, Enjoy, Quanto, Evalia and Thar have not been included in the chart below)
Compact SUV: The Ecosport continues to maintain a decent lead over the Duster while the Terrano remains a distant third.
SUV: The facelifted Scorpio is back at the top of chart in this segment overtaking sibling XUV 500. The Safari Storme continues to struggle.
In overall body-wise sales distribution, nearly every one in two cars sold in India is a hatchback while sedans and MUVs have an about 20 percent market share each.
Maruti Suzuki stock price
On November 24, 2014, Maruti Suzuki India closed at Rs 3346.05, down Rs 2.75, or 0.08 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 3397.60 and the 52-week low was Rs 1541.25.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 102.82 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 32.54. The latest book value of the company is Rs 694.45 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 4.82.

Halftime Report
FII flows into India hit a seven-month low in September. But the question is will flows continue to be under pressure on US Federal Reserve rate hike jitters? Cameron Brandt, Director of Research, EPFR Global believes investors are perhaps edging more towards a risk-off mind set.
He says institutional investors will probably deploy the money piling up in money market funds once they get some certainty about the number of issues. But fund managers continue to talk India up so there seems to be some appetite, he adds.

Rishav Dev, Equity Strategist Capital - Institutional Equities, Quant, too, is not much worried about the decline in fund flows. He says maybe the magnitude of flows has slowed, but it is inflows nonetheless and not outflows. Moreover, he adds, global factors are in India’s favour.
Dev believes November-December are the best months for emerging markets equities. According to him, equity inflows could be in excess of USD 25 billion this year.
Brandt, however, says flows into India equity funds have been quite flat. He says diversified funds like Asia Ex Japan funds, the amount of money they have been getting has scaled off significantly and that means less money channeled into India. At the same time, their allocations into India have been climbing, he adds.
"Going into September, the gem funds we track, their allocations into India were at highest level since we started tracking them in mid-1990's. To a certain degree, there has been an offset in the money that these funds steer towards Asian markets at the moment. Their share to India has been on the increase," Brandt told CNBC-TV18.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Rishav Dev and Cameron Brandt's interview with Sumaira Abidi and Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV18.
Reema: The FII flows into India have hit seven month low in September. What is your sense? Will flows continue to remain as tepid as we saw in the month of September?
Brandt: We are certainly seeing edging towards more of a risk-off mindset among investors but I don't think it's written in stone that they will stay away for the rest of the year. A fair amount of money is piling up in money market funds, I think the institutional investors will like to deploy that once they get some certainty about the number of key issues and fund managers continue to talk India up so there seems to be some appetite.
Sumaira: What sense you are getting about how the picture for flows could shape up in FY15 or calendar year 2015 and what kind of a takeaway would that mean for you?
Dev: I totally agree with Neelkanth Mishra, Head of Equity Strategy – India, Credit Suisse that a dip in FII flows, a momentary dip -- market should not be too concerned with it. One of the important points that everyone should factor in is that the last three months of the year are typically the best months for emerging markets. So we did a historical analysis on weekly inflows into emerging markets and developed markets and we found out that month of November and December are the best months for emerging market and this data is based on last 12 years data.
So a small dip does not matter - Rs 5,000 crore inflow in the month of September, nonetheless it was inflows, there was no outflows. So the magnitude and the pace of inflows have somewhat dried up because of global concerns but we know that the global factors are working in our favour in terms of the oil prices going down, the inflation is in check, remittances are increasing. So the global as well as local factors are keeping India attractive at the moment. So I would not be very concerned with a slowdown in the pace of inflows into India.
Reema: What would your overall estimate be? Currently, as things stand what have been the flows into Indian equity markets and how much can we pick up in the last three months of the year?
Dev: As I mentioned, few months back on your show that this year I am quite sure would be the record year in terms of FII flows. So our estimate is that I would not be surprised that if we get on the equity side alone, inflows in excess of USD 25 billion and if you combine that with the debt inflows, it would be a record year and as I mentioned that local factors as well as global factors are keeping India attractive and there has been -- if you look at emerging market countries, India is the best right now. There are concerns in the China and there are protests happening in Hong Kong, the election mandate is not very clear in Brazil, Indonesia has a new government, Thailand has its own problem. So out of all the big emerging market countries, if any global fund manager has to increase its allocation, India is the best place right now. As Cameron Brandt mentioned that a lot of money has piled up on the money market front and that money will slowly and steadily flow into emerging markets. Third quarter of this calendar year, almost USD 87 billion of inflows were seen in money market funds. So that is the magnitude of amount lying in the money market front.
Sumaira: Is that a similar trend that you are spotting as well? Could you give us some number according to your data, how the flow has been into India, emerging markets, global equity funds?
Brandt: The trend has been very flat. Certainly for India equity funds, we are seeing a pattern somewhere between 100 million in or 100 million out each week, it is sort of yo-yoing a bit. What has changed in recent weeks is that, the big diversified funds like the Global Emerging Markets (GEM) funds, the Asia Ex Japan funds, the amount of money they have been getting has tailed off significantly and that means less money channeled into India. At the same time, their allocations into India have been climbing. Certainly, going into September, the GEM funds we track, their allocations for India were at highest level since we started tracking those funds back in mid 1990s. To some degree, an offset in the amount of money those funds have to steer towards Asian markets is down at the moment.
Reema: Walk us through the flows picture in the emerging markets. There is a slowdown in China, there were protests taking place in Hong Kong so has it impacted flows into these regions and conversely has it benefitted any countries?
Brandt: What we have really seen are two rotations, the biggest rotation is the one from retail institutional investors in terms of putting money into emerging market funds. The second rotation, which is much more modest, but is still significant has been the rotation from developed to emerging market funds. The overall picture is flat but the bias is towards emerging markets and towards emerging Asia in particular.
As I said earlier, the big gem funds have boosted their allocations not just for India, India is perhaps the most eye-catching but their allocation for emerging Asia is general is at the highest level in a couple of decades. What we have seen in the past couple of weeks is, definite move away from Europe and Japan equity funds, continued interest in funds that offer diversified exposure, more modest levels than we were seeing in the summer and certain amount of money coming into the US equity funds, but mostly into US ETF which suggests a more tactical investing and a sense that the US is the place to be.
Sumaira: Do you think the dollar strength that we are seeing actually could derail these flows into EMs?
Dev: It would be a country specific thing in terms of the dollar strength. Right now I think RBI is doing a fantastic job in keeping the rupee very stable and the thing here to note is that the low yielding currencies were the currencies that were hit the maximum and the high yielding currencies like rupee, were the currencies which were more stable. Rupee was stable because of the steps taken by the new government in terms of containing the fiscal deficit to 4.1 in terms of the GDP growth being above 5 percent last quarter. So I won’t be very concerned with rupee depreciating from here. It would be range bound between 58 and 62/USD. So the strength that dollar index is showing right now, more concern should be on the low yielding currencies rather than the high yielding currencies specifically India.

Moneycontrol Bureau
Global IT spending is likely to exceed USD 3.9 trillion in 2015, a 3.9 percent increase from 2014, thanks to digital industrial economy, says Garner, Inc.
The digital business economy is having huge impact on the global IT industry and this is evident from the fact that since 2013, 650 million new physical objects have come online. 3D printer has become a billion dollar market. Also, the number of Chief Data Officers and Chief Digital Officer positions have doubled. And all this statistics is likely to double again in 2015.
Gartner estimates that this year enterprises will spend over USD 40 billion on digital business. “Every piece of equipment, anything of value, will have embedded sensors. This means leading asset-intensive enterprises will have over half a million IP addressable objects in 2020,” Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president at Gartner and global head of Research says.

He further adds that already 38 percent of total IT spend is outside of IT, with a disproportionate amount in digital and by 2017, it will be over 50 percent.
Gartner estimates that 50 percent of all technology sales people are actively selling direct to business units, not IT departments.
But, the impact of digital businesses on jobs will be felt in different ways. By 2018, digital businesses will require 50 percent fewer business process workers. However, by 2018 digital business will drive a 500 percent boost in digital jobs, it adds.
Over the next seven years, there will be a surge in new specialized jobs. The top jobs for digital will include integration specialists, digital business architects, regulatory analysts and risk professionals.

Centre to repeal nearly 300 outdated laws

New Delhi: If you happen to unearth treasure worth even as little as 10 rupees (16 U.S. cents) in India, don't even think of pocketing it - that's because under a law introduced by the former British colonial rulers, it still belongs to "Her Majesty".
Now, however, the Treasure Trove Act of 1878 and nearly 300 other outdated laws are set to be repealed in the largest-ever cull of rules that make India one of the most puzzling places in the world to do business.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hoping that less regulation and faster decision-making will lift India from its ranking of 134 out of 189 countries on the World Bank's ease of doing business table into the top 50 and attract investors.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hoping that less regulation and faster decision-making will lift India from its ranking of 134 out of 189 countries on the World Bank's ease of doing business table into the top 50 and attract investors.

"Some of the laws on our books are laughable. Others have no place in a modern and democratic India," said Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who is leading the legislative clean-up.
Previous administrations have failed to remove obscure laws dating back to the 19th century, either because of objections by government departments or simply a lack of will. But Modi's officers have identified 287 obsolete laws for scrapping in a November session of parliament.
On the chopping block along with the Treasure Trove Act is an 1838 law that says property in an area of the former imperial capital of Calcutta can only be sold to the East India Company, which laid the foundations of the British Empire but ceased to exist more than 150 years ago.
An 1855 measure removing a certain tribe from the purview of local laws because it was an "uncivilised race" will also go.
Even after all these have been abolished, there will still be hundreds of clauses within other laws and thousands of regulations that are real obstacles to business. The government has started identifying these anomalies too, Prasad said.
Spittoons out, scrawny inspectors back in
Flying kites or balloons without police permission is illegal across India as they are classified as an "aircraft" under a 1934 act, and a World War II decree outlaws the dropping of pamphlets from the air in the state of Gujarat.
Under the Motor Vehicles Act, the state of Andhra Pradesh enacted a law that a motor inspector must have a clean set of teeth and anyone with a "pigeon chest, knock knees, flat foot, hammer toes and fractured limbs" will be disqualified.
"There are instances where the entire statute is dysfunctional," said prominent economist Bibek Debroy, who advised Modi during his election campaign and has written a book on the absurdities of Indian law.
He said that obscure laws can sometimes be abused.
A swanky New Delhi hotel was threatened with a lawsuit for refusing to give water to a person who invoked an 1867 act under which a rest house must offer passers-by free drinks of water.
Factory owners have suffered at the hands of government inspectors who insist on rules requiring spittoons to be kept in the premises as well as earthen pots for drinking water. Even if factories install modern fire extinguishers, they must still have red-painted buckets with water and sand to put out a blaze.
Some have a found a way around absurd regulations.
A Post Office Act of 1898 stipulates that only the government has the right of "conveying by post, from one place to another" most letters, so courier companies get around this by calling the letters they send "documents".

Mumbai: Nokia Oyj will suspend handset production at its Chennai facility in India from November 1, the company said on Tuesday.
The plant in Chennai is among Nokia's biggest for making handsets, but has suffered as the company got caught in a tax dispute with the Indian government. Nokia has also suffered as demand for its handsets have waned in the past few years.
"Microsoft has informed Nokia that it will be terminating the manufacturing services defined in the agreement with effect from 1 November 2014. In absence of further orders from Microsoft, Nokia will suspend handset production at the Sriperumbudur facility from 1st November," Nokia said in a statement.
The plant in Chennai is among Nokia's biggest for making handsets, but has suffered as the company got caught in a tax dispute with the Indian government.

In September 2013, Nokia announced it would sell its devices and services (D&S) business, including assets in India, to Microsoft for $7.2 billion by March 2014.
The deal was completed on April 25 but Chennai facility could not be transferred to Microsoft because of legal issues related to tax demand by Indian government.
Nokia started manufacturing in Chennai in January 2006 and exported to markets including in the Middle East and Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand from there.
In March, the Tamil Nadu government served a Rs 2,400 crore notice on Nokia, saying the firm had also sold products from the Chennai plant in the domestic market instead of shipping them overseas. In a separate tax case, the Supreme Court had ordered Nokia India on March 14 to give a Rs 3,500 crore guarantee before it transfers the plant to Microsoft.  As a consequence, Nokia entered into a transitional services agreement with Microsoft to address their immediate production needs and keep the factory operational.
"Unfortunately, the continuing asset freeze imposed by the tax department prevents Nokia from exploring potential opportunities for the transfer of the factory to a successor to support the long term viability of the established, fully functional electronics manufacturing ecosystem," the statement said.
Nokia said that it will be informing all stakeholders including the Labour Commissioner of the suspension.
"As a responsible employer, Nokia is currently evaluating options to minimise the impact on existing employees at the manufacturing facility. It will share further information once details have been finalised," Nokia said.
The exact number of employees at present in its Chennai factory could not be ascertained but in March out of 6,600 permanent employees, about 5000 had opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme offered by Nokia.

Inventors of blue light-emitting diodes share Nobel Prize in PhysicsBy Rachel Feltman October 7 Follow @rachelfeltman

This year's Nobel Prize in physics goes to researchers whose findings you probably rely on just about every day (or, if you're like me, just about every minute). The blue light-emitting diodes they helped create are taking over lightbulbs as we know them, but already see universal use in smartphone flashlights and displays.
At an announcement in Stockholm on Tuesday, the Nobel Prize committee awarded this year's prize in physics to Isamu Akasaki , Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura . The three men -- Akasaki from Meijo University, Amano from Nagoya University (both in Nagoya, Japan) and Nakamura from UC Santa Barbara -- produced blue light beams from their semi-conductors in the early 1990s. Until then, we could create red and green light, but blue remained elusive. 
Red, blue, and green light combine to make the bright white produced by LED lightbulbs. Bulbs using blue light-emitting diodes are more efficient and have a longer lifetime than old fashioned bulbs (up to 100,000 hours, compared to 1,000 for incandescent bulbs and 10,000 hours for fluorescent lights).
Samu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Japan and U.S. scientist Shuji Nakamura won the Nobel Prize in physics on Tuesday for the invention of blue light-emitting diodes, which spurred the development of LED technology. (AP)
What’s a blue light-emitting diode? 
You probably know light-emitting diodes as LEDs. They’re little light bulbs that don’t rely on the filament you can see burning inside an old-fashioned bulb. Instead, electrons move through several layers of semiconducting materials – directly converting electricity into light, sparing the heat-waste of a traditional bulb (and keeping your fingers from getting burned!) Even in fluorescent lamps, which use less energy than fluorescent bulbs, the gas used creates both heat and light.
A red light-emitting diode was invented during the 1950s, but without that magic blue light we couldn’t create white – and if LEDs couldn’t light up our homes, they just weren’t living up to their full potential.
The discovery 
All three Nobel laureates are Japanese by birth, and worked in Japan at the time of their discoveries (Nakamura is now an American citizen, and serves on the faculty of UC Santa Barbara). Akasaki and Amano worked together at Nagoya University, and made early breakthroughs in the development of the semiconductor materials necessary for creating the diode during the 80s. In 1992, they presented their first working blue light.
Nakamura, working at Nichia Chemicals on the island of Shikoku, started work on his own blue LED in 1988. Just a few years after Akasaki and Amano, he developed his own way of creating the necessary layers of semiconductor, and ultimately created a cheaper and easier method of creating the LED.
All three men continued to improve on their work during the 90s, and also independently created blue lasers -- which, because of blue light's very short wavelength, allow for information to be stored much more densely than infrared light does. That’s how Blu-ray movie discs came to be.

How  and why  Showtime resurrected Twin PeaksGlass
October 7, 2014
The groundbreaking drama Twin Peaks changed television forever, and paved the way for the innovative, risky dramas that are now a staple of premium cable networks like Showtime. Now, Showtime has come up with the perfect way to repay the favor: by bringing back the very show that started it all.
The network is reviving Twin Peaks, the hit 1990 ABC show about the search for the murderer of homecoming queen Laura Palmer, as a nine-episode “limited series,” airing in 2016. That will mark the 25th anniversary of its series finale, in which Palmer tells Agent Dale Cooper, as both are seated in the extradimensional Red Room: “ I’ll see you again in 25 years .” Show creators David Lynch and Mark Frost will write and produce all nine episodes, with Lynch directing all of them.
“In some ways, Twin Peaks was the precursor to all of the high-quality, provocative serialized drama that we all do now,” Gary Levine, Showtime’s executive vice president of original programming, told Quartz. “So to go back to the OG of provocative, serialized drama seemed like a no-brainer. Twin Peaks always did and always will define cool, and that was just too tempting to turn away from.”
Lynch and Frost, who began kicking ideas around for a revival three years ago, met only with Showtime about the project, in large part because Levine was the executive who developed and oversaw Twin Peaks during the show’s run on ABC. The clincher, according to Frost: the famously quirky Lynch loved the artwork on the walls of Showtime Networks President David Nevins. (“I love that David said the art in my office was integral to him coming to Showtime,” Nevins told Quartz with a laugh. “It’s my sister-in-law, she’s the artist!”)
Twin Peaks was a full-blown pop culture phenomenon in 1990, as more than 34 million viewers turned into the pilot and fell under the spell of the first season’s intoxicating blend of cherry pie , a dancing dwarf , a log lady and, of course, “ damn good coffee .” Even though the series went off the rails during its second and final season—it lost all its momentum after Laura Palmer’s murder was solved, and Lynch and Frost were focused on outside projects—its cult following, Nevins included, has remained loyal and passionate ever since.
“The show blew me away when it was on,” Nevins told Quartz. “Twin Peaks needed to come back. It needed answers. It was never finished in the right way.”
For Nevins, giving the show its long-overdue proper ending meant getting Lynch and Frost’s commitment that they were going all-in. “You couldn’t bring it back unless you got Frost and Lynch to step up and say they were going to do the whole thing, so that was essential,” said Nevins. “It’s not something that you want to try and do with somebody else.”
In turn, the network is giving them carte blanche to realize their vision. “We give our creators such freedom and such license to explore every part of their dark imaginations, and there’s no one I would rather give that freedom to than David Lynch and Mark Frost,” said Levine.
Of course, that freedom, which led to the wondrous highs of Twin Peaks’ first season, also resulted in the train wreck that was season 2. Levine, however, isn’t worried about a repeat of past mistakes. “I trust in David and Mark, and having 20-some odd years to reflect on it, I think there’s a lot of stories they want to tell, I think there’s a lot of answers they want to provide and I think a lot of satisfaction they want to deliver, so I have no doubt about it,” he said.
While everyone is staying tight-lipped about the new season’s storyline, Lynch and Frost did give Showtime an idea of where they’re headed (“They shared some things with us,” said Levine). There are no casting announcements yet, though if Kyle MacLachlan’s Twitter feed is any indication, he’ll be returning as Agent Cooper.
Better fire up that percolator and find my black suit :-) #Twinpeaks
— Kyle MacLachlan (@Kyle_MacLachlan) October 6, 2014
Twin Peaks also represents a new direction for Showtime, which hadn’t been looking to get into the burgeoning “limited series” genre (which includes shows like Fargo and True Detective) until Lynch and Frost came calling. “But this one made sense. I still fundamentally believe in shows I can bring back year after year and get people hooked,” said Nevins. He added that he hasn’t given up on the notion that the same thing will happen with Twin Peaks if Lynch and Frost come up with additional ideas: “I’ll have them at my party as long as they want to stay!”

Sensex ends 296 points down; 5 reasons why markets are sinkingSensex ends 296 points down; top 5 reasons why Indian markets are under pressure

(As per provisional data,…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex ended nearly 300 points lower following a sharp correction in European markets. Nifty has breached 50-day DMA and further downside in the near term can't be ruled out, say analysts.
The 50-share index closed at 7,852.40, down 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent. The S&P BSE Sensex ended at 26,271.97, down 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
DLF (5.68%), NMDC (5.57%), Jindal Steel (4.92%), Hindalco (4.90%) and Sesa Sterlite (4.49%) were among the top losers.
NTPC (up 1.62%), GAIL (up 1.16%), Power Grid Corporation (up 1.07%), Tata Power (up 0.93%) and Wipro (up 0.64%) were among the Nifty gainers.
Here is a list of five possible reasons which may be responsible for the current weakness in the markets:
Profit booking by FIIs:
Foreign institutional investors, which were largely responsible for an over 25 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex, have become net sellers of Indian equities in the last five trading sessions.
As per provisional data, FIIs have sold net of Rs 2583.95 in the last five trading sessions, while DIIs or domestic institutional investors remain net buyers.
On a monthly basis, MFs continued to be net buyers (US$526.9mn) of Indian equities in September 2014 for the fifth month in a row.
While FII net buying continued, the run-rate has come down to US$1bn in the past two months compared to US$2.2bn in the previous five months beginning March 2014, ICICI Securities said in a report.
"There has been lull in the FII flows in the last 7 to 10 days. It is because of the volatility in the global liquidity which we have witnessed in the last 7 to 10 days," said Sanjay Dongre, Fund Manager , UTI Asset Company Pvt. Ltd.
"We have seen a bit of volatility even in the forex market where the dollar has appreciated against most of the currencies. So, once there is a bit of stability in the currency market , looking at the attractiveness of the Indian market, the flows from the FII sides are likely to continue going forward also," he added.
Caution ahead of Q2 earnings:
Infosys will be the first Sensex company to declare its results for the quarter ended September 30. The IT major will declare its second quarter numbers this Friday on the 10 October.
The month of October could be volatile as earnings will take center stage, say analysts. At present levels, there is a little margin of safety and either equities correct or earnings have to surprise on the upside, they say.
"Keeping in mind the last month closing, I broadly expect a volatile month with bias on the negative side as we have less number of trading sessions due to the festive session break, but a lot more depends upon how the earnings season shapes up," said Ajit Mishra , AVP- Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.
Arvind Sanger , Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management , said this quarter earnings are not going to have any meaningful benefit from Modi's election or anything else that has happened since then.
Slowdown in Europe/China:
Dwindling demand cut factory activity across much of Asia and Europe in September, sending it to multi-month lows and raising the chances that global growth will slow in the months ahead.
Despite gentler price rises, China's figures were mired barely above contraction, Britain slumped, and the drop in new orders did not even spare Germany , the strongest member of the euro zone currency bloc, or France, its No. 2 economy , Reuters reported.
Euro zone factories' final September PMI was 50.3, a further slackening in pace and its lowest reading since July last year, as new orders contracted for the first time in more than a year, added the report.
"The global trend, that has been a little bit of a risk off, is that Europe is in a recession and things are not getting any better. The Ukraine and Russia tensions are continuing, casting some stress on the European economy, and with China weakness there is a little bit of nervousness about the risk off on a global basis," said Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management.
"So, there has been some sell off in India and elsewhere. We could always have something go off the rails, but barring any major upheavals on a global basis, the market will continue to consolidate and for it to go much lower, it would take some more global negative cues," he added.
Lack of Big-Bang Reforms by Modi Government:
The S&P BSE Sensex closed on a muted note, down 56 points, for the month of September. Domestic issues such as coal block de-allocation and fading hopes of a rate hike in 2015 have kept the markets under pressure.
September 2014 was marked by three high-level bilateral engagements by India's PM -- with Japan, China and the US -- aimed at improving trade and diplomatic relations.
These engagements are expected to improve India's visibility in the global arena, especially amongst EMs.

Zomato looking to join the billion dollar club through PE funding

(Taking advantage of the…)
Online restaurant tracker Zomato is set for a big makeover, one that may catapult it to the billion dollar club. The company is in talks with PE players for a fresh round of fund raising which could value the online restaurant guide at 1 billion dollars, three sources with direct knowledge share. Taking advantage of the fresh valuations could be its long time investor Info Edge which is looking at selling a part of its 51% stake in Zomato.
Sources suggest that Zomato is in the process of raising $100-150 million from private equity players, the pre-money valuation is pegged at around $800 mn and post the fund raise it could be close to $1 bn in valuations, two sources said.
This deal will mean an astronomical rise in Zomato's value from the close to $160 mn value in its last fund raising in 2013 with investments from Sequoia Capital. Info Edge is eyeing a hefty return for its investments in Zomato.
Experts point out that the re-rating of Zomato is on several counts especially with Justdial's market value running up since the time of its IPO. Zomato has expanded overseas at a scorching speed with four acquisitions in the last few months.
Zomato gets over 15 million visits across its web and mobile platforms every month. In the past one year alone, the traffic has grown by over 300 per cent, an official statement said. The company is revamping its model to start monetising table bookings. Zomato is also looking at getting into cash-less payment at restaurants.
When contacted, Zomato did not respond to an ET Now query. Info Edge denied any plans of selling stake in Zomato.

Nokia to suspend production at Chennai plant from November 1

By Bharani Vaitheesvaran & Anandita Singh Mankotia
NEW DELHI: Nokia will suspend production of handsets at its Sriperumbudur plant from November 1, the company has said, after Microsoft decided to terminate their contract manufacturing pact from that date. The Finnish company, however, will continue paying wages to the 1,100 employees till a decision is taken to shut down the factory.
Although software major Microsoft had purchased Nokia's global handsets and services business earlier this year, the Sriperumbudur factory was not part of the deal owing to an assets freeze order on the plant over a Rs21,000-crore tax dispute with Indian authorities.
Microsoft continued sourcing handsets - mainly the popular Asha series devices - from the factory on a contract basis, but with its recent decision to cull the Asha series, has now decided to end the agreement. "Microsoft has informed Nokia that it will be terminating the manufacturing services defined in the agreement with effect from November 1.
In absence of further orders from Microsoft, Nokia will suspend handset production at the Sriperumbudur facility," Nokia said in a statement on Tuesday. Sriperumbudur is close to Chennai. In April, Microsoft had paid $7.2 billion for Nokia's global handsets and services business.
Last year, the income tax department had frozen the Sriperumbudur plant over royalty payments made by Nokia to its parent company in Finland. The case is being pursued by Nokia in the Supreme Court. "Following the news announced today, Nokia will continue to do the best it can to minimise the impact on its employees," the company said.

PIO visa will give impetus to India s develo...Government Of India
(PM Modi said the Home Ministry…)
NEW DELHI: With the government notifying the decision to grant life-long visa to Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), Prime Minister Narendra Modi today highlighted the swift action taken on his promise made in the US and hoped it will give an impetus to India's development journey.
He said the Home Ministry is working on the new programme that will merge PIO and Overseas Citizenship of India schemes and that instructions have been issued to Embassies and Consulates that apart from special circumstances, US nationals should get visas for 10 years.
"Am very glad to share that GoI ( Government of India ) has moved swiftly on the announcements I had made on consular & visa issues during my USA visit," Modi tweeted.
He noted that a gazette notification was issued on September 30, two days after his announcement, which said that all PIO cards are valid for lifetime of cardholders. Earlier it was 15 years.
"The gazette notification on 30th September fulfils the announcement that all PIO cardholders will now enjoy a life- long visa to India," the Prime Minister said.
The notification also says that PIO card holders would not have to report to police stations, even if their visit exceeds 180 days, he said in another tweet.
"Instructions have been issued to Embassies & Consulates that apart from special circumstances, USA nationals should get visas for 10 years," Modi added.
Systems are in place to introduce visa on arrival for US tourists in October itself, a PMO statement said.
"Am sure these efforts will further strengthen our bond with the diaspora & give an impetus to our development journey ," Modi said in one more tweet.
He had made the announcements during an address in New York on September 28.

HP s split: Whitman creates 2 of America s b...Apple
(Her plan is to make HP's parts…)
SAN FRANCISCO: In one day, Meg Whitman has created two of America's biggest companies. All she had to do was break apart Hewlett-Packard, the company credited with creating Silicon Valley.
Her plan is to make HP's parts bigger than its current whole, allowing one side of the company to return to HP's roots servicing big business customers and solving big computing problems under the label Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. On the other side under the brand HP Inc. will be PCs and printers, the products that powered HP's growth for much of the last decade but are wilting in the face of consumer demand for mobile technology.
That Whitman will stay on as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise says much about where she believes the future of the company lies. And it makes clear that she is very much putting her own stamp on the iconic company she has led for three years.
On Monday, Whitman, 58, presented this move as something as a victory lap, despite criticism that the PC business, where she will still be chairman of the board, is being treated as a weak sibling.
"We've done a huge amount of work to focus these two companies," Whitman said in an interview. Both companies, she said, "will be well positioned to compete and win."
Whitman's role as the person who would try to fix HP by splitting it into two would have been unthinkable when she arrived in Silicon Valley in 1998 from an executive role at Walt Disney. She came armed with a Harvard MBA and little technical experience, something for which she was widely criticized after several embarrassing site failures on eBay. But she proved a quick learner and helped turn eBay into one of the Internet's giants before leaving in 2008.
After a failed run as the Republican candidate for California governor, she returned to the tech world and took on the corner office at HP, where she was already a board member. It was a formidable task. Arguably the largest tech outfit in the world by revenue and employees at the time, the company was struggling with management turnover - two chief executives in two years - and lack of a clear vision of what HP was supposed to be.
It appears Whitman has found that vision: one that looks a bit like the IBM of the West - with an emphasis on products rather than IBM's consulting services - and another that looks a bit like Compaq Computer, a Texas computer company that HP controversially merged with 12 years ago.
Both firms, Whitman said, will pick up increased value on Wall Street, and will use the money for new research and development, along with acquisitions of other technology companies.
"We've got a really clear strategy of value creation for our shareholders," she said.
When Whitman took over HP, she considered but ultimately abandoned the idea of splitting off the PC business. At the time, she argued that HP wasn't healthy enough for such a move.
Now, she argues, the time is right.
People who knew her said Whitman, who became a billionaire through her time running eBay, was likely to keep running the new enterprise business for several years.
"The fact that she's throwing herself heart and soul into this, when she could be doing anything, says a lot," said Maynard Webb, the chairman of Yahoo, who worked with Whitman at eBay for seven years. "If she is announcing this to the world it is because she is completely convinced it is the right thing to do."
During her time at eBay, Whitman made several fateful decisions, including the purchases of Skype and PayPal, which took years to make into successes. A move into China was eventually reversed.
In every case, Webb said, Whitman "gets insights that come from mucking in data, then she socializes it, and gets lots of opinions.
"We'd go to the board with a 'white hat' and a 'black hat' version of how things might work out, all the wonderfuls and all the horribles," said Webb. "Everyone looked at all the pieces, and everyone reached a decision. I'd assume every major executive and board member is on board with this decision."
  Whitman was equally focused on measurement during her gubernatorial campaign. An aide who worked with her there said Whitman obsessed about her poll numbers and wanted to personally lead fundraising efforts, a level of micromanagement that campaign officials tried to discourage.
But Whitman viewed both as a measure of her success - her standing in the polls was the equivalent of her company's stock price, and the amount of money raised was analogous to the amount of revenue generated by a company, according to the former staff member.
Others who know Whitman say her role as a relative newcomer to HP allowed her to make a striking move.
"She doesn't have any romantic nostalgia to hold onto things that don't make sense anymore," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a management professor at Yale University who has also known Whitman since eBay. "This really is driven strategically."

Euro zone factories' final September PMI was 50.3, a further slackening in pace and its lowest reading since July last year, as new orders contracted for the first time in more than a year, added the report.
"The global trend, that has been a little bit of a risk off, is that Europe is in a recession and things are not getting any better. The Ukraine and Russia tensions are continuing, casting some stress on the European economy, and with China weakness there is a little bit of nervousness about the risk off on a global basis," said Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner of Geosphere Capital Management.
"So, there has been some sell off in India and elsewhere. We could always have something go off the rails, but barring any major upheavals on a global basis, the market will continue to consolidate and for it to go much lower, it would take some more global negative cues," he added.
Lack of Big-Bang Reforms by Modi Government:
The S&P BSE Sensex closed on a muted note, down 56 points, for the month of September. Domestic issues such as coal block de-allocation and fading hopes of a rate hike in 2015 have kept the markets under pressure.
September 2014 was marked by three high-level bilateral engagements by India's PM -- with Japan, China and the US -- aimed at improving trade and diplomatic relations.
These engagements are expected to improve India's visibility in the global arena, especially amongst EMs.

Nobel Prize for physics goes to inventors of low-energy LED lightprint
An invention that promises to revolutionize the way the world lights its homes and offices - and already helps create the glowing screens of mobile phones, computers and TVs- earned a Nobel Prize on Tuesday for two Japanese scientists and a Japanese-born American.
By inventing a new kind of light-emitting diode, or LED, they overcame a crucial roadblock for creating white light far more efficiently than incandescent or fluorescent bulbs. Now LEDs are pervasive and experts say their use will only grow.
"Incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th century; the 21st century will be lit by LED lamps," the Nobel committee said in announcing its award to Japanese researchers Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano and naturalized U.S. citizen Shuji Nakamura.
Their work, done in the early 1990s, led to a fundamental transformation of technology for illumination, the committee said. And when the three arrive in Stockholm to collect their awards in early December, "they will hardly fail to notice the light from their invention glowing in virtually all the windows of the city."
Nakamura, 60, is a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Akasaki, 85, is a professor at Meijo University and Nagoya University in Japan, while Amano, 54, is also at Nagoya. Akasaki and Amano made their inventions while working at Nagoya, while Nakamura was working separately at the Japanese company Nichia Chemicals.

At a press conference, Nakamura said he is "happy to see that my dream of LED lighting has become a reality. Nowadays we can buy energy-efficient light bulbs in the supermarket and help reduce energy use. I hope this helps to reduce global warming too," he said, reading from a prepared statement.
Asked earlier if he realized the importance of his research early on, he told reporters, "Nobody can make a cellphone without ... my invention."
Akasaki told a nationally-televised news conference in Japan that he had faced skepticism about his research bearing fruit. "But I never felt that way," he said. "I was just doing what I wanted to do."
Amano said in an interview on NTV aired from Lyon, France on Wednesday that he credits Japan's high school and university systems for his win.
"To know that the ultimate purpose of education, or anything, is to do something to help people. That says it all," he said.
Before their work, scientists had long been able to produce red and green light with LEDs. But they needed a blue LED as well to make white light, a goal sought for about 30 years. The three new Nobel laureates created blue LEDs.

It's "a fundamental invention that is rapidly changing the way we bring light to every corner of the home, the street and the workplace," H. Frederick Dylla, the executive director and CEO of the American Institute of Physics, said in a statement.
For illuminating schools, homes and offices, "it's quite possible this will change everything. All the light sources could easily become
blue-LED-based light sources," said Mark Rea, director of the Lighting Research Center at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.
Nadarajah Narendran, director of research at the center, estimated the share of illumination by LED lights in homes, offices, streets and industries is approaching 10 percent in the United States. Within five years, he said, that fraction will probably exceed 30 percent as prices come down.
People can already buy LED lights for their homes at a fairly affordable price, he said.
In poor countries, such lights are replacing alternatives like kerosene lanterns, he said.
"It's touched (people) from the poor to the rich in a very short time frame," he said.
The Nobel committee noted that for people not supplied by power grids, LED lamps may be feasible to use with cheap solar power because they consume so little energy.
The committee also said the efficiency of LEDs helps save the Earth's resources because about one-fourth of world electricity consumption is used for lighting.
Not all reactions to the prize were laudatory. Many colleagues of Nick Holonyak Jr., a retired professor from the University of Illinois who invented the red LED in 1962, have long said his work was unjustly overlooked by the Nobel committee. In the past, Holonyak, now 85, has said the award was far less important to him than the work.
But on Tuesday, Holonyak said the work done by the new winners was built on achievements by himself and dozens of others who worked with him.
"I find this one insulting," he said in an interview in Urbana, Illinois.
Last year's physics award went to British scientist Peter Higgs and Belgian colleague Francois Englert for helping to explain how matter formed after the Big Bang.
On Monday, US-British scientist John O'Keefe split the Nobel Prize in medicine with Norwegian couple May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser for breakthroughs in brain research that could pave the way for a better understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's.
Watch: 2 Japanese, 1 American Win Nobel Physics Prize
The Nobel award in chemistry will be announced Wednesday, followed by the literature award on Thursday, the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday and the economics prize on Monday.
Worth 8 million kronor ($1.1 million) each, the Nobel Prizes are always handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896. Besides the prize money, each laureate receives a diploma and a gold medal.
Nobel, a wealthy Swedish industrialist who invented dynamite, provided few directions for how to select winners, except that the prize committees should reward those who "have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind."
This year's physics prize, the Nobel committee said, was given with that idea in mind.

India ranks 18th on most desirable places to work list; US ontopThe Asia Pacific region does not generate as much interest as a possible work destination as the US or Europe. (Reuters)
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 4:50 pm
India has been ranked 18th globally on the list of most desirable destinations to work, even as 70-80 per cent of Indians are willing to work in an overseas location, says a new report.
The US has been ranked on the top, followed by the UK, Canada, Germany and Switzerland, making them the five most desirable countries to work on the list compiled by the Boston Consulting Group, total jobs.com and The Network.
The other countries in the top 10, where foreigners said they would like to work include — France (6th), Australia (7th), Spain (8th), Italy (9th) and Sweden (10th).
As a desirable work destination, India was ranked 18th among G20 nations.
The Asia Pacific region does not generate as much interest as a possible work destination as the US or Europe, largely because of the perceived difficulty of learning Asian Language, the report said, but noted “some fast growing Asian countries are starting to reclaim workers they have lost.”
Globally, one in every five participants already has international work experience and almost 64 per cent said they would be willing to go to another country for work.
According to the survey, around 70-80 per cent of Indians are already living abroad or are willing to move to a foreign country for work.
Some of the most important workplace attribute in India include good work life balance, job security, learning and career development and appreciation for your work.
The report noted that most people are willing to uproot themselves and head for a foreign country for work mainly because they want to broaden their life experience and that of their families.
“The proportion of people willing to work abroad is particularly high in countries that are still developing economically or are experiencing political instability,” the survey said adding that more than 97 per cent of Pakistanis say they would be willing to go abroad for work.
Around 94 per cent of survey respondents in Netherlands said they would consider moving to another country for work. In France, where the economy has been showing signs of stagnating, the same proportion (94 per cent) is willing to leave home.
On the other hand, people in the US, Germany and the UK, three economies that have rebounded more convincingly, are not as willing to go abroad for work.
Barely a third of US respondents say they would consider the idea and only 44 per cent of those in the UK and Germany say they would be interested in taking a job in another country, the report said.

BSE sensex tumbles to 2-mth low; down 296ptsAfter opening 137 points lower, the 30-share index continued its slide to touch the day's low of 26,250.24 before ending the day at almost two-month low of 26,271.97. (Reuters)
PTI | Mumbai | Posted: October 7, 2014 4:46 pm
BSE benchmark Sensex today plunged 296 points to close at nearly two-month low due to widespread losses in metal, healthcare, consumer durables and capital goods sector stocks on capital outflows and retail investors ahead of earnings season amid a mixed trend overseas.
After opening 137 points lower, the 30-share index continued its slide to touch the day’s low of 26,250.24 before ending the day at almost two-month low of 26,271.97, a level not seen since August 14, registering a steep fall of 296.02 points or 1.11 per cent.
The gauge had lost 62.52 points in the previous session on October 1. Stock markets remained closed on October 2, 3 and 6 for Gandhi Jayanti, Dussehra and Id-Ul-Zuha, respectively.
FII/FPIs pulled out Rs 63.24 crore from domestic markets on October 1, according to exchange data.
Similarly, the broader-based NSE Nifty closed down by 93.15 points or 1.17 per cent at 7,852.40 after shuttling between 7,943.05 and 7,842.70.
Brokers said the sentiment dampened on foreign capital outflows and offloading of positions by retail investors ahead of the earnings season, with Infosys posting results later this week.
Of the 30 Sensex shares, 23 closed lower led by Hindalco (down 4.35 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (4.32 per cent) and Cipla (3.67 per cent), while NTPC, Gail and Tata Motors remained major gainers.
Globally, a mixed closing on the other Asian markets and a lower opening of the European stocks as a report showed German industrial production contracted the most in more than five years, also negatively impacted sentiment.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 63.24 crore last Wednesday as per the provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
Sector-wise, BSE metal index suffered the most by falling 2.65 per cent, followed by healthcare by 1.85 per cent. Captial goods index by 1.78 per cent, Consumer durables index by 1.72 per cent, Realy index 1.27 per cent, PSU index 1.20 per cent and Banking index 0.87 per cent.

Unemployed man kills parents inBiharPress Trust of India | Nawada | Posted: October 7, 2014 4:32 pm
In a shocking incident, an unemployed man killed his parents by slitting their throat at their house in Bihar’s Nawada district, a police officer said on Tuesday.
The incident took place on Monday night when he unemployed man Bablu Kumar attacked his parents Bhubaneshwar Lal (50) and Shanti Devi (45) with a sharp-edged object and slit throat of the two while they were asleep at their house, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Sanjay Kumar Pandey said.
The elderly couple was found dead on Tuesday morning by neighbours, the DSP said, adding that bodies have been sent for post-mortem.
Kumar was unhappy with his parents who used to rebuke him for not finding work to meet his family’s needs and often threatened him that they will sell off properties and shift elsewhere if he did not mend his ways, the DSP said.
The accused and his wife have been arrested and sent to jail in connection with the murder case of the elderly couple, he said.

2 Japanese  1 American win Nobel Prize inphysicsProf. Shuji Nakamura demonstrates different LED lights during a presentation in Santa Barbara.
Associated Press | Stockholm | Posted: October 7, 2014 4:29 pm
Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Japan and US scientist Shuji Nakamura on Tuesday won the Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of blue light-emitting diodes, a new energy efficient and environment-friendly light source.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the invention is just 20 years old, “but it has already contributed to create white light in an entirely new manner to the benefit of us all.”
Akasaki, 85, is a professor at Meijo University and distinguished professor at Nagoya University. Amano, 54, is also a professor at Nagoya University, while the 60-year-old Nakamura is a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The laureates triggered a transformation of lighting technology when they produced bright blue light from semiconductors in the 1990s, something scientist had struggled with for decades, the Nobel committee said.
Using the blue light, LED lamps emitting white light could be created in a new way.
“As about one fourth of world electricity consumption is used for lighting purposes, the LEDs contribute to saving the Earth’s resources,” the committee said.
Nakamura, who spoke to reporters in Stockholm over a crackling telephone line after being woken up by the phone call from the prize jury, said it was an amazing, and unbelievable feeling.
US-British scientist John O’Keefe yesterday split the Nobel Prize in medicine with Norwegian couple May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser for breakthroughs in brain cell research that could pave the way for a better understanding of diseases like Alzheimer’s.
The Nobel award in chemistry will be announced tomorrow followed by the literature award on Thursday and the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
The economics prize will be announced next Monday, completing the 2014 Nobel Prize announcements.

Where BJP has nothing to lose but a state to gainModi in Aurangabad Saturday; strategic start to campaign. Source: Pavan Khengre
Written by Kavitha Iyer | Latur/beed | Posted: October 7, 2014 12:43 am
Of the  46 BJP MLAs in Maharashtra, the Marathwada region accounts for just two. That makes it obvious why any strategy for a change in government will have to be anchored in these 46 seats, apart from parts of western Maharashtra where the Shiv Sena and the BJP would both look to shell the NCP’s Maratha fortresses.
Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first rallies for the Maharashtra elections, it’s clear now that the BJP’s pitch is for a majority government on its own. And at the heart of the number-crunching behind that pitch would be Marathwada, a fact borne out not only by Modi’s choice of Beed and Aurangabad to kick off his campaign, but also by the fact that Amit Shah too attended a huge rally of about four lakh OBCs at Bhagvangad last Friday. The event is an annual Dussehra gathering of the Vanjara community at the spot canonised by patron saint Sant Bhagvan. Shah made a political speech, asking OBCs to rally behind Pankaja Munde and pitchforking her into a mass leader.
Ramping up its Marathwada presence is shrewd strategy for the BJP. Winning 30 of Marathwada’s 46 seats was critical to the Congress-NCP’s 2009 win. While parts of Marathwada — Latur, Nanded and parts of Hingoli — have been Congress strongholds for years, other areas such as Aurangabad and Parbhani have been the Shiv Sena’s only bastion outside Mumbai and Konkan. In the past, Marathwada’s big fight has been between the Congress and the Shiv Sena, barring Gopinath Munde’s presence in Beed and the more recent BJP-versus-NCP fight in the same district.
Congress MP from Hingoli Rajeev Satav says the fight remains one between the Congress and the Sena. “The Congress will finish first, the Shiv Sena second,” he predicts of the four-cornered contest. His maths is that the BJP and Sena don’t have a CM candidate from Marathwada, while the possibility of Ashok Chavan as chief minister cannot be ruled out. “If the BJP is committed to Munde’s legacy, why don’t they declare Pankaja as CM candidate?” he says.
There is also the Congress theory that since the NCP anyway routinely worked against Congress candidates, the impact of a four-cornered fight will be felt more by the Sena and the BJP.
But the mood on the ground indicates neither the Congress nor the Sena can fully protect its strongholds.
Seat by seat
In the Nanded-Hingoli belt, the BJP has reinforced itself by roping in Madhav Kinhalkar, who had filed a paid-news case against former CM MP Ashok Chavan and other leaders. Ameeta Chavan is expected to win easily in Bhokar, but the BJP is hardly conceding defeat. Only a couple of weeks ago, sarpanchs of about 40 villages in Bhokar were being wooed by the BJP, an effort reportedly engineered by Khatgaonkar.
In Nanded South, Chavan aide and sitting MLA Omprakash Pokarna is continued…

Punished for not supplying toilet paper to Rly chiefs home: OfficialWritten by Shyamlal Yadav , Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: October 7, 2014 2:57 am
A mid-level official of the Railways claims he has been “censured for poor performance” and shunted to an “irrelevant” training course in “unexplained haste” for his refusal to supply toilet paper rolls to the residence of Railway Board chairman, Arunendra Kumar.
Ajay Singh, a director-rank official whose last posting was as a senior divisional mechanical engineer with Northern Railway, has written a letter of complaint to A K Puthia, chief mechanical engineer of Northern Railway, claiming he is “being victimised”.
Singh alleges that he received a call from Kumar’s residence at 1, Moti Bagh on August 9 “ordering” him to send toilet paper rolls. Singh says he refused to send the rolls and later did not pay a visit to the chairman’s wife, Kanta Kumar, despite being told to.
Toilet rolls and other such supplies are meant for passenger coaches.
Arunendra Kumar told The Indian Express that the allegations are “baseless”. Replying to Singh’s allegation, Kumar said:
“Now that we are reduced to discussing toilet papers, let me tell you we don’t even use toilet papers at home.”
He asked if it was not far-fetched to claim that “in this day and age, officers will require toilet papers from railway supplies?”
“Are we to believe that if the chairman needs a pillow in his house, he will take it from railways stores?” Kumar asked rhetorically. Singh says on August 26, he received a letter ordering him to a five-week training on “Procurement Process for World Bank Funded Projects”. And on August 27, he got a letter “casting aspersions” on his “professional competence”. A copy of the protest letter is marked to eight senior Railway officers besides Puthia and is in possession of The Indian Express.
In the five pages of allegations, Singh has documented all the calls he received from the top bosses of Northern Railway following his refusal. Singh says Puthia called him at least thrice, on August 14, 21 and 23, asking if the latter had visited Kumar’s wife. “I had informed that I had not done so,” Singh writes.
On August 26, Singh got a letter dated August 25 and signed by Puthia regarding his deputation to training. And a day later, he received the letter “casting aspersions” on his “professional competence”.
Kumar said Ajay Singh should have spoken to his superiors if he had grievances. “I think the officer’s only fear was that he would be transferred out of Delhi. It is again a figment of his imagination because as far as I know, there was no such plan,” he said.
Kumar said Puthia will prepare a response. “If his perception of the railway administration is what is reflected in the letter, the establishment will respond to it. His superiors will counsel him and take necessary action. There is no question of punishing him,” he said
Ajay Singh’s letter further reads: “These two developments clearly indicate a certain unexplained haste by CME (chief mechanical engineer) himself in removing me from Sr DME post… It is rather unusual that I am first sent on training for five weeks and then continued…

Save precious time tracking your investments
STOCKHOLM: Japanese scientists Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano and American Shuji Nakamura won the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics for inventing a new energy efficient and environmentally friendly light source, the LED, the award-giving body said on Tuesday.
"With the advent of LED lamps we now have more long lasting and more efficient alternatives to older light sources," the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement awarding the 8 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize.
"As about one fourth of world electricity consumption is used for lighting purposes, the LEDs contribute to saving the Earth's resources," it said.

Physics was the second of this year's crop of Nobels. The prizes were first awarded in 1901 to honour achievements in science, literature and peace in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and business tycoon Alfred Nobel.
As winners of the physics award, the first field to be mentioned in Nobel's will, the laureates join ranks with some of the biggest names in science such as Albert Einstein , Niels Bohr and the husband and wife team of Pierre and Marie Curie.
While the increasingly complex science celebrated by the Nobels has often been far from dinner table conversation, it has also highlighted more widely known achievements, such as last year's award for the prediction of the Higgs boson particle.

(The award, which carries…)
NEW DELHI: Renowned defence technologist and father of 'BrahMos' cruise missile, Apathukatha Sivathanu Pillai , was conferred the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award by President Pranab Mukherjee here today.
The award, which carries cash of Rs 5 lakh, citation and a plaque, was given to Pillai for his outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace and missile technology.
During a function held at Rashtrapati Bhavan auditorium, the President said conferment of this award on Pillai is recognition for the outstanding work done by our space and defence research scientists.
Mukherjee also congratulated the entire scientific community and ISRO in particular for the remarkable feat of having successfully executed the Mars Orbiter Mission in its very first attempt, a press release issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan said.
"I, on my behalf and that of all our countrymen, pay tribute to the scientists and technical staff who have toiled tirelessly to create history," the President said.
67-year-old Pillai has been credited with development of critical missile technologies through realisation of 'Agni', 'Prithvi', 'Nag' and 'Akash' missiles.
Pillai, who is also a recipient of civilian honours Padma Shree in 2002 and Padma Bhushan in 2013, has worked as Chief Controller (Research and Development), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of 'BrahMos Aerospace', a joint venture between India and Russia.
"Pillai exhibited outstanding leadership qualities that helped India possess the fastest, most precise and potent cruise missile, BrahMos, which is now inducted in the Indian Armed Forces. His contribution to this venture has made him to be regarded as the 'Father of BrahMos'," reads the citation.
A recognised scientist, Pillai had graduated in Electrical Engineering from Madras University. He underwent management programme at Harvard Business School and obtained PhD from Pune University.
He has worked with great visionary leaders like Dr Vikram Sarabhai , Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr A P J Abdul Kalam to contribute in country's major space research programme.
Pillai has also contributed to the successful development of SLV3, India's first satellite launch vehicle, as a core team member and in the evolution of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) configuration for Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
He has written many books including revolution in leadership, nano science and nano technology for engineering.
The Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award honours each year an Indian, residing in India or abroad, who is an exceptionally outstanding and distinguished business leader, management practitioner, public administrator, educator or institution builder for his or her sustained individual contributions and achievements of high professional award and excellence.
Pillai is recipient of the 15th Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award.

We may see 150-pt correction on Nifty: MiteshIT stocks
In a chat with ET Now, Mitesh Thacker , Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com, shares his views on the market. Excerpts:
ET Now: How are you approaching trade today because the commodity stocks are certainly looking weak and what are the specific stocks that you will be trading at this hour?
Mitesh Thacker: For last few days, we have been maintaining a bias towards IT stocks , couple of defensive names and possibly looking at more of shorting opportunities in the cyclicals and that kind of approach still continues. I have also maintained levels of around 7840-7820 as the first support levels to watch out for.
We are now very close to those levels. Maybe around 7840-7820, do expect some kind of some kind of support but in case those levels are being broken, then we might be in for 100-150 point correction in Nifty .

This is the right time invest in markets: ExpertCanara HSBC OBC Life Insurance Co Ltd
(We see GDP bouncing back…)
In a chat with ET Now, Ritu Gangrade Arora, CIO, Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance Co Ltd, shares her views on the market and some sectors. Excerpts:
ET Now: In the short term, do you think the Indian markets have hit a roof, so to speak, because we are not going anywhere, the Nifty is stuck in a range and large cap stocks are also gravitating towards weakness?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: The markets have not performed in the last few months. Three months' returns are sub-3% of the broader market, Nifty and Sensex. There is a time correction that the market has had since July.
The fundamentals are improving on the sidelines. For example, India has got a ratings upgrade from S&P. Both CARE and Crisil have given statements today that the speed of improvement in many corporates is significant and they see an economic recovery on the anvil.
We see GDP bouncing back after two financial years of subpar, sub-5% to 5.7% growth last quarter. So these are green shoots on the periphery.
At the current earnings growth, market valuation of 16.5 times does look a tad bit above long-term average and that is where the market is taking a breather. But from a long-term perspective, it is still a very exciting time to invest in the market with a two or three-year horizon because if we see a recovery in the market, earnings growth will no longer make the market look expensive and there should be good double digit returns to be made.
ET Now: What is it that you are sensing about the weakness that one has seen constantly in the metals universe?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: It is time for pause as far as metals, or for that matter anything linked with the Indian growth or global growth, is concerned. We have seen crude coming off, we have seen commodities come off globally and there is more consolidation on the anvil before one can start looking at these sectors again.
ET Now: The earnings season will start soon. So this time around, are we in for some surprise or result disappointment because a lot of market men are betting big on Q2 numbers?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: There would be consistent improvement in sectors like IT, auto and pharma. Automobiles have been demonstrating improvement in volume numbers and pharma should continue to give about 20% earnings growth.
In terms of banking numbers or capital goods or infrastructure, it is a little early to expect a rebound.
ET Now: What about Infosys? Come Friday and this time we would be discussing Infyosys' performance. What is it that you are expecting from the IT sector per se and Infy in particular?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: The large IT companies have been demonstrating about 17-18% earnings growth and the midcaps are at about 20%. The sector is poised at about 17 times forward.
 
It is a little above long-term averages and is expensive, but given the fact that this is a sector which is stable, the global recovery is reflecting in their numbers and over the next couple of years should consistently show earnings improvement.
Any consolidation or reaction that comes to result or any other news for me is a point to enter. As we know the IT sector has outperformed the index by a very wide margin over the last three months. So I prefer balanced portfolio. I have always been overweight IT and I continue to like the sector.
ET Now: How are you approaching consumers now? They are expensive, yet the underlying momentum in HUL or ITC has been quite remarkable.
Ritu Gangrade Arora: For a new entry, these stocks and sectors look a little expensive, but the time correction that we are seeing in the market would definitely be an opportunity to build positions in this sector.
It may not be the right time to build new positions, but every opportunity to balance the portfolio and to make it a little more balanced between these sectors and growth sectors like banks, infra, cap goods should be utilised. A little correction should be waited for before building new positions in these sectors.
ET Now: So what really could be the next trigger for this market? For the moment it appears that globally things are stuck, risk off mode is prevalent, flows are also at a multi-month low and earnings expectations may not be met?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: We have already witnessed a 26% performance in the market returns in the Nifty and 40% odd in the midcaps. I think that is a good return for a year like 2014 where the fundamentals are still stressed.
The market won't be having a big upside trigger from here. We are going to see 64000 crore of divestment papers hitting the markets. So I do not see a big trigger for the market on the upside, but what gives me confidence is I do not see a sharp correction ahead either.
The market will be in this range and continue to have a time correction rather than a specific correction and be in plus 5%, minus 7%-8% kind of a range for the next couple of months. If we could end the year with 25% plus return for 2014, that would be a very positive number.

(Analysts say there are concerns…)
NEW DELHI: MphasiS slipped over 5 per cent in trade on Tuesday on growing concerns over revenues that the company gets from Hewlett-Packard and downgrade by Macquarie.
Analysts say there are concerns over revenues that the company gets from Hewlett-Packard which owns 60 percent stake in MphasiS, Reuters reported.
"Separately, global investment bank, Macquarie downgraded the MphasiS to "underperform" from "outperform"," added the report.
Over the weekend, HP said it would split into two listed companies and eliminate another 5,000 jobs as part of its turnaround plan.
Mphasis Ltd's (MPHL) parent HP confirmed that it has split its business into two viz. 1) HP Business Enterprise , which will comprise business technology, servers, software, and services and 2) HP Inc , which will house the personal computers, printers, etc.
"Both the companies will be separately listed and traded. This decision of the parent will likely bring a long awaited clarity on MPHL's future as to whether HP will retain this business in India, make it a 100% subsidiary or merge it with HP's India business ," Kim Eng India said in a report.
"We like MPHL due to substantial surplus cash with the company and will await clarity from its board of directors in India," added the report.

Nokia to shut down its Chennai plant from November 1Nokia to close down Chennai handset unit from next month
Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 07, 2014
First Published: 16:46 IST(7/10/2014) | Last Updated: 02:31 IST(8/10/2014)
Comments
Nokia will suspend handset production at its Chennai facility in India from Nov. 1, the company said on Tuesday.
The plant in Chennai is among Nokia's biggest for making handsets, but has suffered as the company got caught in a tax dispute with the Indian government. Nokia has also suffered as demand for its handsets have waned in the past few years.
"Microsoft has informed Nokia that it will be terminating the manufacturing services defined in the agreement with effect from 1 November 2014. In absence of further orders from Microsoft, Nokia will suspend handset production at the Sriperumbudur facility from 1st November," the company said in a statement.
In September 2013, Nokia announced it would sell its devices and services (D&S) business, including assets in India, to Microsoft for $7.2 billion by March 2014. The deal was completed on April 25 but Chennai facility could not be transferred to Microsoft because of legal issues related to tax demand by Indian government.
In March, the Tamil Nadu government served a Rs. 2,400 crore notice on Nokia, saying the firm had also sold products from the Chennai plant in the domestic market instead of shipping them overseas.
In a separate tax case, the Supreme Court had ordered Nokia India on March 14 to give a Rs. 3,500 crore guarantee before it transfers the plant to Microsoft. As a consequence, Nokia entered into a transitional services agreement with Microsoft to address their immediate production needs and keep the factory operational.
 
"Unfortunately, the continuing asset freeze imposed by the tax department prevents Nokia from exploring potential opportunities for the transfer of the factory to a successor to support the long term viability of the established, fully functional electronics manufacturing ecosystem," the statement said.
Nokia said that it will be informing all stakeholders including the Labour Commissioner of the suspension. "As a responsible employer, Nokia is currently evaluating options to minimise the impact on existing employees at the manufacturing facility. It will share further information once details have been finalised," Nokia said.
The exact number of employees at present in its Chennai factory could not be ascertained but in March out of 6,600 permanent employees, about 5000 had opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme offered by Nokia.

No relief for Jayalalithaa  Karnataka HC rejects bail pleaHundreds of supporters protested on the streets and shouted slogans on Tuesday after the Karnataka High Court denied bail to AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa who was jailed by a Bengaluru court in a corruption case last month.
 
Jayalalithaa was forced to step down as chief minister of Tamil Nadu after being found guilty of amassing wealth beyond her known sources of income and was replaced by her close aide O Panneerselvam. The Bengaluru special court handed her a four-year prison sentence and a Rs100-crore penalty.
 
Unless the conviction is overturned by a higher court, the AIADMK chief will be disqualified from contesting elections for a period of 10 years from the date of the verdict.
 
Celebrations by the party cadre fizzled out after initial media reports that Jayalalithaa had been granted bail turned out to be incorrect. Tight security was in place around the high court complex with police anticipating a rush of AIADMK supporters and leaders.

Rejecting Jayalalithaa’s plea, justice AV Chandrashekhara said there were no grounds for granting bail and reacted sharply when Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said he would not oppose if bail was granted conditionally. “The public prosecutor filed strong written objections but when he was asked to present arguments before this court, he said no objection.”
The bail petitions of Jayalalithaa's associates Sasikala Natarajan, VK Sudhakaran and J Ilavarasi were also rejected on the same grounds. The AIADMK chief is likely to approach the Supreme Court in appeal on Wednesday.
Citing several orders of the apex court, the judge said, “Suspension of sentence is not automatic (when an appeal is filed). Bail at conviction stage is different from bail when trial is on.”
“Corruption amounts to violation of human rights and leads to economic imbalance,” the judge added.
Watch: Jayalalithaa’s bail plea rejected by Karnataka HC
 
The 66-year-old AIADMK chief, a former movie star, has a cult following in her state and is renowned for distributing free laptops, jewellery and fans to voters.
On Tuesday morning, posters saying Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu would be held hostage if Jayalalithaa was not released from jail sprung up in parts of Chennai.
The AIADMK tried to distance itself from the row and its workers tore down the sheets allegedly put up by an expelled party member.

“Warning...immediately release people's Chief Minister Amma...otherwise we will hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu as hostages,” read the message which also bore the name of several AIADMK members.
The party said the posters were put up without its knowledge and stressed that it stood committed to the welfare of all sections of society.
 

Pak not bothered about civilian casualties: BSF DGComments
The flare-up at the international border will likely continue for a few more days is the assessment of the Director General of the Border Security Force, DK Pathak, who is currently at a forward position in the Jammu sector where Pakistan shelling killed five civilians.

“It will take a couple of days before it subsides. The shelling has now gone into a reaction/counter-reaction mode and frankly if you ask me, Pakistan is not bothered about civilian casualties,’’ Pathak told Hindustan Times on the phone from a forward post on the border.
Reiterating his resolve to ‘hit Pakistan hard,’ Pathak said the Indian government’s mind was clear on how to deal with the aggressive neighbour.
“Both the home minister and the defence minister have made it clear that we are to respond effectively. We have been given a free hand to answer each provocation. If Pakistan fires mortars, we retaliate with mortars and match rocket launchers with rocket launchers.”
The belligerence at both ends has taken a toll on both sides and while India has lost five civilians and nine more were injured in overnight shelling, the death toll in Pakistan, according to the BSF, has gone up to 13.
While there are some reports of the Pakistani army providing covering fire to infiltrators, Pathak was firm that the neighbour had fired without provocation.
“I would be delighted to know the reasons for why Pakistan is targeting civilian population and that too on Eid. As a policy we do not resort to first fire. At the last flag meeting in August we agreed to not fire at each other. We are a professional force and we are only retaliating,’’ Pathak further added.
The retaliation, he admitted was fierce.
“They are getting it back badly,’’ Pathak said.
Pakistan, in turn, has accused India of targeting its civilians and on Tuesday lodged a protest with the United Nations Military Observer Group.

Krantz: Is dropping PC unit HP s salvationAP
Q: Is shedding the PC unit HP’s salvation?
A: Investors have been pushing Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) to break into two parts for years. But now that they’re getting their wish, many analysts aren’t much more bullish on the stock.
Shares of Hewlett-Packard responded well to the news, rising $1.67, or 4.7%, to $36.87 on Monday. Investors have long argued that HP’s mature printer and computer business might perform better as a separate and more aggressive company. Meanwhile, the company’s big-data and comporate data services could use the management concentration to boost competitive statue in an industry filled with nimble and aggressive rivals.
But even as the shares were rising, analysts were issuing reports warning investors to curb their enthusiasm over what the deal meant for the company long-term. With a deal of this size, there are many risks that the separation could be messy and problematic as the company loses synergies, according to a note to clients by Abhey Lamba, analyst at Mizuho Securities.  Lamba boosted the firm’s price target on Hewlett’s stock to $40 from $35 a share, but still rates the stock a “neutral.” Longer-term, Hewlett-Packard needs to prove that the two, smaller companies can be more aggressive in their respective markets.

We've all heard it before: Americans are lousy when it comes to saving for retirement. The justification for the lack of savings ranges from economic hardship to our inability to escape the consumerism that surrounds us on a daily basis. Regardless of the reason, many people refuse to change their financial habits. However, options are available to those who haven't built a large nest egg for retirement.
An unsurprising portion of Americans have nothing saved for their golden years. According to a recent survey by Bankrate , 33% of 30- to 49-year-olds have not saved any money for retirement, while 26% of 50- to 64-year-olds say the same. In fact, 14% of people 65 and older haven't placed any money aside for the future, either. Yet the majority of Americans feel the same or better about their personal finances than they did last year.
How much do you really need to save for retirement? The answer clearly depends on your own situation, but people are typically told they need to save $1 million or more. It's safe to say that many Americans will not accomplish that milestone.
Fortunately, there are effective financial actions you can take to help compensate for a lack of savings. Let's take a look at three alternatives to accumulating a million-dollar nest egg.
1. Delay retirement
The first alternative is the most obvious, but also the riskiest. If your retirement funds are unable to generate sufficient income to replace your day job, maintaining some form of employment in your later years may be the solution for you. Delaying retirement can help improve your finances and secure larger Social Security payments. For example, someone born after 1960 can receive 124% of his or her monthly Social Security benefit by retiring at age 70 instead of age 67. While Social Security benefits could be taken as early as age 62, that person would only receive 70% of his or her monthly benefit.
Although working longer is a dangerous strategy since your future health status and job opportunities are unknown, many Americans appear to be relying on this approach. According to a Gallup poll, 24% of Baby Boomers don't expect to retire until they reach the age of 65, and 39% of Baby Boomers don't expect to retire until they are 66 or older. A separate poll from Wells Fargo reveals that 37% of Americans with incomes between $25,000 and $100,000 say they will never retire and will work until they are either too sick or dead.
Working longer may also reduce health care expenses in retirement. Couples retiring at age 65 are expected to incur $220,000 in medical costs on average during their golden years, according to an analysis by Fidelity Investments. Couples retiring earlier, at age 62, and before Medicare coverage experienced an average of $57,000 in additional costs.
MILLENNALS: Young, broke, and dangerously uninsured
2. Eliminate debt
Naturally, having fewer expenses in retirement reduces the need for income. Instead of focusing on small actions such as skipping daily lattes or canceling extra premium channels, make dramatic changes by reducing the biggest bills first and retiring debt free.
Do you really need that oversized house with the accompanying mortgage? Housing is easily one of the biggest expenses we have in life. If you're looking to give your retirement a financial boost, live in a home that is affordable, not something that looks like it belongs on a magazine cover. You won't miss those empty rooms and you'll sleep better knowing that you have a mortgage-free retirement. Not having a $200,000 mortgage in retirement can save you $1,000 in monthly payments. If you're willing to plan far enough ahead, make extra payments each month on your existing mortgage to pay it off sooner and save money on interest payments.
Brand new cars and auto loans should also be avoided. The average auto loan term increased to 66 months during the first quarter of 2014, according to Experian Automotive. That is the highest level on record and quite the burden for a retiree with little or no savings. Nearly 25% of all new loans originating during the quarter had terms extending out 73 months to 84 months, and the average amount financed for a new vehicle loan reached an all-time high of $27,612. A reliable used car can be found for at least half that price.
DEAR PARENTS: You need to teach your kids about money
3. Pack your bags
Retirement is no time to be feeling extra patriotic. Leaving the comfort zone of America could help stretch retirement dollars further. The world is a big place, so you need to research the possibilities thoroughly, but plenty of publications around the Internet offer good starting points. Live and Invest Overseas recently released its 2014 Retire Overseas Index, naming the best countries for retirement. Based on factors such as economic conditions, tax rates, climate, and safety statistics, Portugal ranked as the top retirement destination, followed by Ecuador and Malaysia.
If leaving the country is too unimaginable, you can still maximize retirement savings by moving to a different state. Bankrate.com recently listed South Dakota, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, and Wyoming as the best retirement destinations within the United States. Yes, the winters are brutal in some of these places, but weather probably shouldn't be your main concern if you haven't saved enough for retirement.
"While the states that ranked highly may not be thought of as typical retiree havens, seniors should consider more than sunshine when choosing a place for their golden years," said Bankrate.com research and statistics analyst Chris Kahn. "The Dakotas both ranked in our top 10 for the second year in a row due to their low cost of living, low crime rates, good health care quality, low taxes, and excellent satisfaction scores from residents. Of course, the best place to retire will differ drastically depending on the individual."

Sensex Hits 2-Month Closing Low; Cyclicals DragGold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
The BSE Sensex fell for a second straight session on Tuesday to its lowest closing level in nearly two months as cyclical stocks such as Hindalco Industries declined ahead of the earnings reporting season.
Banking, metal and infrastructure stocks were among the leading losers ahead of July-September results from Infosys on Friday, which traditionally kicks off the earnings reporting season in India.
Adding to the woes, overseas investors had been net sellers in four out of the last five sessions. Foreign investors sold Indian shares worth $25.5 million on Wednesday, exchange and regulatory data showed.
Also weighing on sentiment, Credit Suisse Private Banking and Wealth Management Investments - Asia Pacific downgraded India to "neutral" from "outperform" on October 1, citing "rich" valuations after a sharp rally post-elections. Markets were closed from Thursday to Monday because of holidays.
"There is a selling pressure and people are looking to churn portfolio. Earnings would be the next big trigger, while upcoming state-election results will also have an impact. The undercurrent is still positive," said Suresh Parmar, head, institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets.
The benchmark BSE Sensex closed down 1.11 percent at 26,271.97, while the broader Nifty fell 1.17 percent to 7,852.40.
Cyclical stocks such as metals led the fall. Hindalco Industries closed down 4.5 percent and Tata Steel ended lower 1.9 percent on concerns about weaker growth in China.
Among other cyclical stocks, banks and infrastructure companies also witnessed selling pressure. Bank of Baroda ended 3.6 percent lower, while State Bank of India closed down 2.4 percent.
Infosys, which is set to report its second-quarter earnings on Friday, fell 0.4 percent.
Infrastructure stocks continued their fall. Larsen & Toubro closed 2.2 percent lower, falling for the fourth straight session as investors changed appetite from core infrastructure-related companies. However, L&T is still up 32 percent so far this year.
However, tyre makers gained as natural rubber prices in the local market are near their lowest level in five years. Apollo Tyres closed up 6 percent, while JK Tyre and Industries gained 4.4 percent.

Cipla to Set Up Manufacturing Plant in Iran
Reuters | Updated On: October 07, 2014 17:00 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
Mumbai: Generic drug maker Cipla Ltd has agreed to set up a manufacturing plant in Iran, as part of its strategy to boost its presence in the country's $4 billion pharmaceuticals market that is growing at about 13 per cent annually.
Cipla, which will own 75 per cent stake in the plant being set up in partnership with its local distributor, will invest about Rs 225 crore ($36.65 million) over three years on areas including machinery and equipment for the facility.
The Indian pharma company, which made headlines in 2001 by making antiretroviral medicines to treat AIDS in Africa for under $1 per day, gets more than half its revenue from markets outside India, including the United States and Europe.
Although the sanctions regime, imposed by the United States and European Union over Tehran's nuclear programme, allows trade in humanitarian goods such as food and medicine, not many Indian drugmakers have significant presence in Iran.
"Cipla has been providing medicines to patients in Iran for several years and believes that Iranian patients cannot be denied to medicines due to sanctions," the company said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.
"We have observed a high prevalence of respiratory disorders and cancer cases in Iran. There were also patients suffering with diseases like thalassemia, HIV/AIDS and heart diseases, who have been at a risk due to the impact of sanctions."
Setting up the plant will help in faster registrations of new products and will improve its competitive position, the company said, adding that it does not expect any impact on its US and European businesses due to its investments in Iran.

Nokia to shut down Chennai plant on November 1

Telecom gear maker Nokia today said that it will shut down its Chennai plant from November 1 as Microsoft has terminated mobile purchase agreement from the the factory and it is left with no business.
"Microsoft has informed Nokia that it will be terminating the manufacturing services defined in the agreement with effect from 1 November 2014. In absence of further orders from Microsoft, Nokia will suspend handset production at the Sriperumbudur facility from 1st November," Nokia said in a statement.
In September 2013, Nokia announced it would sell its devices and services (D&S) business, including assets in India, to Microsoft for USD 7.2 billion by March 2014.
The deal was completed on April 25 but Chennai facility could not be transferred to Microsoft because of legal issues related to tax demand by Indian government.
Nokia started manufacturing in Chennai in January 2006 and exported to markets including in the Middle East and Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand from there.
In March, the Tamil Nadu government served a Rs 2,400 crore notice on Nokia, saying the firm had also sold products from the Chennai plant in the domestic market instead of shipping them overseas.

In a separate tax case, the Supreme Court had ordered Nokia India on March 14 to give a Rs 3,500 crore guarantee before it transfers the plant to Microsoft.
As a consequence, Nokia entered into a transitional services agreement with Microsoft to address their immediate production needs and keep the factory operational.
"Unfortunately, the continuing asset freeze imposed by the tax department prevents Nokia from exploring potential opportunities for the transfer of the factory to a successor to support the long term viability of the established, fully functional electronics manufacturing ecosystem," the statement said.
Nokia said that it will be informing all stakeholders including the Labour Commissioner of the suspension.
"As a responsible employer, Nokia is currently evaluating options to minimize the impact on existing employees at the manufacturing facility. It will share further information once details have been finalized," Nokia said.
The exact number of employees at present in its Chennai factory could not be ascertained but in March out of 6,600 permanent employees, about 5000 had opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme offered by Nokia.

Providing further corroboration that the auto industry is benefiting from early signs on an economic revival, domestic passenger vehicle sales for the auto industry as a whole rose 4.68 percent to 2.18 lakh units in September (from 2.06 lakh in the same month last year).
This was the third straight month of increases for the industry as a whole, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.
Within companies, Asian firms ( Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai, Honda and Nissan) continued their strong showing in the Indian market while American and European companies (Chevrolet, Ford, Renault, Volkswagen and Fiat) witnessed their market share come off, compared to a year ago.
While leaders Maruti and Hyundai continue to launch one successful product after another, Honda’s successful re-launch of the City (with a first-time diesel-engine option for a Honda car) this year has helped the company increase its sales dramatically compared to last year.
In terms of domestic market share, Maruti remained the clear leader at 45.71 percent, while Korean firm Hyundai remains firmly ensconced in the second place at 16.02 percent. However, utility vehicles maker Mahindra (8.76 percent) has reclaimed the third-place spot that it had conceded to Honda (6.86) three months ago.
The list of the top-10 selling cars is dominated by Maruti (six models) and Hyundai (three), with the only vehicle not belonging to these two companies being Mahindra’s Bolero. The city hatch, Alto, is back in the first place, overtaking the Dzire that topped last month.
Segment-wise analysis:
City hatch: Maruti Suzuki Alto remains the clear leader, notching up close to 20,000 sales while Hyundai Eon is a firm but distant second. The Datsun Go appears to have lost its way after a distant start while the Tata Nano continues to sell in fits and starts.
Compact hatch: The Wagon R remains the clear leader here and the Grand i10, which till recently threatened to become the segment leader, has lost some steam. The semi-automatic Celerio has also achieved blockbuster status, consistently notching more than 5,000 unit sales for a few months now. The workhorse Santro continues to sell well despite its age (and despite some reports saying it would be phased out soon). But sales of the Beat have fallen by more than half over the period of a year.
Premium hatch: The action is heating up in this segment, with the Elite i20 (which replaced the earlier i20 variant in July) witnessing increasingly high buying interest even as the Swift continues to rule the roost here. The i20’s gains appear to have come at the cost of the Ritz, another steady seller since a few years. (Note: Cars selling below 1,000 units – Skoda Fabia, Renault Pulse, Chevrolet U-VA, Fiat Punto -- have not been included in the chart below).
Compact sedan: In the fast-selling compact sedan segment, the Dzire remains the clear leader, while recent launches Hyundai Xcent and Tata Zest continue to notch up respectable sales. The Honda Amaze appears to have taken a bit on the chin due to the new entrants.
Midsize sedan: After what appears to be a production blip last month, the fourth-generation Honda City launched earlier this year is back to rule the charts -- selling close to 5,000 units -- at the cost of rival Hyundai Verna. Analysts will however look forward keenly to the fortunes of Maruti Ciaz, which sold 1,375 units (to dealers) and is the market leader’s third – and most serious -- attempt at cracking this segment, after the Baleno and SX4. (Note: Cars selling less than 1000 units -- Ford Fiesta, Nissan Sunny, Chevrolet SAIL, Fiat Linea, Mahindra Verito, Renault Scala -- have not been included in the chart below.)
Utility vehicles: The segment has long been dominated by the Bolero even as Ertiga and Innova, too, have been selling about 5,000 units. The latest entrant, Mobilio, is off to a robust start as well. (Sales of Gypsy, Enjoy, Quanto, Evalia and Thar have not been included in the chart below)
Compact SUV: The Ecosport continues to maintain a decent lead over the Duster while the Terrano remains a distant third.
SUV: The facelifted Scorpio is back at the top of chart in this segment overtaking sibling XUV 500. The Safari Storme continues to struggle.
In overall body-wise sales distribution, nearly every one in two cars sold in India is a hatchback while sedans and MUVs have an about 20 percent market share each.
Maruti Suzuki stock price
On November 24, 2014, Maruti Suzuki India closed at Rs 3346.05, down Rs 2.75, or 0.08 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 3397.60 and the 52-week low was Rs 1541.25.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 102.82 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 32.54. The latest book value of the company is Rs 694.45 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 4.82.

What makes Anand Rathi bullish on these stocksIn an interview to CNBC-TV18, Devang Mehta, Senior VP and head - Equity Advisory, Anand Rathi Financial Services shares his views on the market and specific stocks going ahead.
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: What do you like at this point in time?
A: We have been recommending our clients to have a proxy play rather than going into something like real estate or housing. So, we did recommend  Cera Sanitaryware and  Kajaria Ceramics as a clear proxy play of sanitation items.
Also, immediately the stocks that I recollect again being a proxy play for housing could be something like  Can Fin Homes which is a Canara Bank Home Finance company trading at ridiculous valuations, robust NIMs, very low NPAs, serving the lowest strata of the society and is on a continuous expansion spree. So, this is one stock which is a midcap stock but could potentially give 50-60 percent returns if somebody would sit for a period of 1.5-2 years.
Another stock that we like as a proxy play to housing is something like  Century Ply which again would boom in times of growing GDP growth as well as when we talk about housing for all.
I think 25-30 percent market share in the organised market for Century Ply. Again if you compare it to stocks like Green Ply or some other plywood manufacturers this again trades at a bigger discount. So, these are couple of themes that we would like to play and these two stocks could potentially give good returns and these are so called midcaps which could potentially become largecaps.
Q: A word on  Cairn India that is approaching three year lows now; the only direct play on Brent crude. However, historically Rs 280-290 is something that has not broken even in bear markets. Is it good time to buy or would you avoid it?
A: I would rather avoid it because we don’t see any upward side movement for crude in the coming days and generally it is considered to be a thumb rule that crude prices and the stock price of Cairn Energy are normally directly proportional.
So, I don’t see any value emerging out of the commodity or metal stocks like Cairn in the shorter term. Markets will today take cognizance of the earnings season that will come and that would be very important rather than nibbling into something like Cairn for the shorter or the medium-term.
Q: We are seeing some weakness recently in pharmaceutical stocks but they are the top gainers of the year – Cipla , Sun Pharma , how would you view some of these shares?
A: This will clear cut be buying opportunity. People have been waiting for pharma stocks to have a material dip and whatever is happening to Sun Pharma, Cipla,  Dr Reddy’s or even Lupin , the earnings would surprise on the upside.
If earnings are to drive markets going forward, it would be earnings of IT, pharma, FMCG and to certain extent auto. Your capex side of the market would still suffer for one or two quarters. So, if somebody is relying on earnings for the quarter, which will begin in another three to four days, pharma is where one should put their money into for at least one or two quarters.
Q: What would be your top pick in IT, pharma, FMCG and auto at this point in time?
A: Among the large cap IT stocks  Wipro is our favourite and we also like Persistent Systems .
In pharma we would prefer Sun Pharma and Lupin in the largecap and  Ipca Laboratories in the midcap universe.
So, pharma and IT would drive earnings going forward in the short-term.
In FMCG we would like midcap stocks like Bajaj Corp ,  Pidilite Industries which has a monopolistic durable competitive advantage which offers enough durability in the shorter term.

Don't fight the ECB: Is there yield in Europe?
Widely held expectations interest rates in the eurozone aren`t heading higher any time soon got a fillip last week after European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi gave more details of the bank`s plans to purchase covered bonds and asset-backed securities (ABS).

Don't fight the ECB: Is there yield in Europe?
Widely held expectations interest rates in the eurozone aren`t heading higher any time soon got a fillip last week after European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi gave more details of the bank`s plans to purchase covered bonds and asset-backed securities (ABS).
Post your opinion here
 
Even though interest rates in Europe are widely expected to stay in negative territory for a while, some analysts are still finding opportunities to find returns.
"We are now in an era where cash is negative so there will be a hunt for yield," Iain Stealey, fixed income fund manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC last week.
Widely held expectations interest rates in the eurozone aren`t heading higher any time soon got a fillip last week after European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi gave more details of the bank`s plans to purchase covered bonds and asset-backed securities (ABS).
The details came after the ECB kept interest rates at record lows and last month`s surprise decision to cut the bank`s main rate to a new low of 0.05 percent, while the rate on the marginal lending facility was also decreased and the rate on the deposit facility was cut further into negative territory.
"We`ve always had the mantra of don`t fight the [Federal Reserve]. And I fully believe the mantra of don`t fight the ECB," Stealey said. "It`s really not a bad spot for high yield. High yield doesn`t like recession. "
It isn`t clear how much the broader market agrees with this assessment. Globally, funds have been flowing out of high-yield bonds, with around USD 6.15 billion leaving the segment`s exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds so far this year, according to data from Jefferies.
But while USD 2.84 billion has left developed Europe high-yield funds over the past three months, the segment has still seen a net USD 4.43 billion in new funds so far this year, the data show.
Nonetheless, investors remain cautious, keeping a weather eye on further central bank intervention on both sides of the Atlantic.
"In Europe and Japan, bond valuations look especially unattractive, but the likelihood of added central bank easing measures should also limit increases in bond yields," Sylvie Golay Markovich, head of fixed income analysis at Credit Suisse`s private bank, said in a note last week, noting she expects euro-denominated high-yield bond prices will be supported in the short-term.
But she added that European high-yield bonds are susceptible to declines in bond prices in the US, where analysts generally expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sometime next year.
Some are looking to other European assets for yield.
Societe Generale has upgraded its view on European real estate to overweight, citing expectations it will get a boost from low long-term bond yields and the sector`s tendency to re-distribute more than 70 percent of its earnings.
"Real estate continues to offer a 4 percent yield, significantly higher than the equities market (3.2 percent), government bonds (1.0 percent in Germany) or the credit market (1.9 percent)," it said.
Credit Suisse`s private bank also sees value in European properties - at least for Asian investors.
"European properties offer much more attractive rental yields than their home markets, with regional diversification benefits," it said, noting it believes the outlook for European commercial property is brightening.
"Outside cities like London, Paris, Stockholm or Munich, investment yields of Madrid (5.3 percent) and Dublin (5.5 percent) are far higher than net rental yields of prime offices in Hong Kong (2.85 percent), Singapore (3.45 percent) or Tokyo (3.5 percent)," it said.

Bangalore: Former Tamil Nadu chief minister and AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa might get bail in the disproportionate assets case as the prosecution on Tuesday told Karnataka High Court that it had no objections to conditional bail to the Tamil leader.
Neither Jayalalithaa, nor any of the other three convicts in the case were present at the court during the hearing.
Celebrations have already begun in Chennai, even as the court is yet to announce its verdict on the bail plea.
Jayalalithaa has been jailed since September 27 after a special court in Bangalore sentenced her to four years in jail under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
#jayalalithaa #bail #conditional bail #da case
All eyes have been on the Karnataka HC after Jayalalithaa filed her bail application and sought stay on the court's conviction. Valiant protests have been taking place around Tamil Nadu against the leader's arrest. Heavy security is in place in and around the Bangalore central jail in view of the bail plea hearing.
AIADMK had allegedly also put up posters threatening to hold Kannadigas residing in Tamil Nadu hostage if Jayalalithaa did not get bail on Tuesday.
Jayalalithaa has been jailed since September 27 after a special court in Bangalore sentenced her to four years in jail under the Prevention of Corruption Act. She was also slapped a fine of Rs 100 crore in connection with the Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case.

Firing has been on since October 5. Five civilians have been killed and 34 others injured in shelling by Pakistani troops on Monday in Jammu's Arnia sector.
In the last flag meeting in August both sides have agreed to avoid such a situation.
Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said that corrective measures have been taken and there was nothing to worry about.
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that that the ceasefire violations were a reflection of an unstable government in Pakistan.

Manjhi during a surprise visit to the PMCH on Sunday evening to meet the Dussehra stampede victims had found the doctors unavailable in the Emergency Ward which also wore a filthy look. Besides, several medicines were said to be unavailable. When Manjhi had sought to meet the Hospital Superintendent Lakhinder Prasad, he was not around.
The stampede took place at Patna's Gandhi Maidan on Friday, soon after Dussehra celebrations. More than 20 people were injured as well.

Breakup may cost you Twitter followers: Study7

London: A romantic breakup could cost you 20 Twitter followers on average, according to a new study.
Researchers from Aalto University, Qatar Computing Research Institute and the University of Michigan found that a decrease in cross-messaging on social media can be indicative of an impending split and the event itself predicts a loss of followers.
Researchers tracked Twitter users who were likely in a romantic relationship from November 4, 2013, till the end of April 2014 (24 weeks).
A romantic breakup could cost you 20 Twitter followers on average, according to a new study.
#twitter #twitter followers #social networks
Some of the users deleted their accounts over the course of the study while some made them private, researchers said. "After the breakup, we were expecting partners to potentially unfollow each other but, apart from that, we were expecting 'business as usual' as far as the social network was concerned," researchers said.
"However, when we tried to quantify our hypothesis that there should not be ripple effects affecting other connections, we found evidence for the opposite," they said. The study found that a breakup caused a dip in followers (20 on average) on Twitter.
The loss of followers could be a reflection of the tendency for friends of a couple to take sides when the two part ways, according to 'The Daily Dot'. Another possibility is that the marked increase in depressive tweets after a breakup - especially from the "rejectee" - drives the followers away.

5 Tips to Boost Your Email Marketing Effortsreddit
Email marketing can be a tough nut to crack, especially if you haven't done any of it all. I was skeptical at first, too, but then I realized that I don't necessarily have to connect with my email subscribers only as a means to an end. If anything, I can continue to build my community through my email list, a more connected community.
I'm sure that there are numerous bloggers blogging on daily basis about the ins and outs of email marketing , even here on Huff we've got several columnists writing about their experiences of email marketing, both good and bad .
The difference between cold emailing , and actually building a legitimate email lis t is that with your legitimate list, you're going to be building a community around; while cold emailing only works as a means to an end. Give and get principle. If you're looking to seriously boost your email marketing results, then give some of the following tips a try.
Treat Your Best Subscribers
Email marketing is a data-driven way of marketing, the more data you've gathered about your subscribers - the more tailored choices you're able to give to them. For example, out of your 1,000 subscribers, only 100 have opened, and clicked on your links in the email you sent.
Why not treat this special bunch to a special offer? It only makes sense, as giving these subscribers discounts is only going to increase their loyalty down the road.
Positive Popups
I've never been a fan of popup-marketing, simply because I didn't have good experiences with it when I started, but recently there have been some notable tools enter the market (think: OptinMonster , Pippity , SumoMe ), all of which provide tools necessary to build user-friendly email popups!
Popup Ads have shown me that I can provide great quality content, and also collect an email address of a visitor when the time is right. Many of the new email marketing tools come equipped with smart algorithms that can capture an email address of even the most rare users.
(no subject)
Have you experimented with subject lines recently? Do you ever receive emails that don't have a subject line, like ever? Well, a study has confirmed that there is a significant increase in open-rate of emails that don't posses a subject line - most likely because the email client is then displaying the direct contents of the email: Hello Name, blah blah.
It's, then, much easier to see what the email contains, unlike using a traditional subject line like 'Hi.', or 'Sorry for bothering you.'. Try using no subject lines for a few emails (perhaps cold ones...), and see what it does to your conversions!
Reminders
If you think that every single email subscribers remembers everything about you, and your business - then you're terrible wrong. People signup for all kinds of services, often on frequent basis, and it's rare to see a list of 25,000 email subscribers; where every single person is in sync with your latest.
For that reason alone, it can be really helpful to email out reminders to your subscribers, letting them know that you're still alive and well, which will only increase the exposure of your own products, or just content that you're producing.
P.S
Postscript
Yes, using a postscript at the end of email can prove to be a very good place to put actionable calls. I mean, quite often the postscript part is where we inject something we didn't want to talk about in our initial  letter, so if you're looking to boost some sales to older products, or just want to raise awareness - use a postscript at the end of your emails, and let the magic happen.

Todays Nobel Prize-winning physicist only got $200 for his inventionLeo Mirani @lmirani
October 7, 2014
In the small Japanese town of Anan, in 1993, Shuji Nakamura, an employee at Nichia Corporation, invented the blue light-emitting-diode (LED), which today lights up homes, offices, billboard and streets across the world. This morning Nakamura, along with Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, won the Nobel Prize in Physics .
Within a few years it was clear that the blue LED was a multi-million-dollar invention, though McKinsey recently reckoned  (pdf) it will be worth some €64 billion ($80 billion) by 2020. Its potential goes beyond just lighting: Companies are working on integrating LEDs with Wi-Fi and smart cities too.
Nakamura’s reward from Nichia? 20,000 yen , or some $200 at the time.
Back then, Japanese firms and most employees still held to the rule that the employer was a substitute for family, and that work was an end in itself, not a means to enrichment or personal glory. Nakamura was having none of it. He quit his job in 2000, moved to the US, and became an American citizen. He is now at the University of California in Santa Barbara.
In 2001, Nichia sued Nakamura for infringing trade secrets. Nakamura counter-sued and demanded a share of the booty. The two parties settled in 2005, with Nichia agreeing to pay Nakamura 840 million yen (then worth $8.1 million) after a lower court had awarded him 20 billion yen. The New York Times reported at the time  that it was the largest payout ever made to an employee for an invention.

The secret of New York Citys mythic bagel-making waterTough to match. (Brian Ach/Invision for Xbox/AP Images)

There are essentially two elements—calcium and magnesium—in very specific proportions that make the water in the New York metro area unique.
Fortunately, the ratio of those two ingredients to other minerals also happen to be ideal for baking crispy-on-outside-chewy-on-the-inside New York-style bagels, as they help to strength the glutens in the dough.
That was the conclusion reached by Josh Pollack, a bagel baker and entrepreneur in Denver, Colorado, who recently designed a process to recreate New York City’s legendary water some 1,700 miles away from the source, and is now using it in his Mile High City shop, Rosenberg’s Bagels .
“It’s mainly New York’s watershed program that’s the difference,” he says of the initiative that protects the region’s natural water sources, enabling local utilities to minimally-process the city’s drinking water. “They don’t use a sediment filter for their water, so a lot of the minerals that come from the reservoirs, as a result of those watershed protections, are still in the water.”
It’s all about the total dissolved solids (TDS) in the water, Pollack says, which is a measure of all of the combined substances in a given water sample. All of the elements in water affect the baking process in some way, but it’s the proportions of each element to the others that really make a difference in gluten strength. Those ratios also tend to be very local, differing not only from city to city, but also neighborhood to neighborhood. As a result, Brooklyn water might have a different TDS than Manhattan water, based on the treatment facilities serving each. (City-wide water reports can vary widely as a result, as most will simply report on the average TDS over a large area, rather than calling out these local fluctuations.)
Pollack, a New Jersey native, spent nearly a year sending water samples from across the NYC metro area back to Colorado State University for testing in order to narrow down the specific elemental differences. He then contracted with a local filtration company to build his shop a system that would reintroduce the necessary minerals, in the proper proportions, into his metro Denver tap water.
As of now, the actual proportions involved and the workings of the system are proprietary, but according to research conducted at the National Institutes of Health, New York’s water supply contains about 13.5 mg of calcium per liter, far lower than the national average of 50.6 mg/L. The TDS ratio for calcium and magnesium in New York’s water supply is about 1 to 5.

It isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds, says Dr. Jim Self, manager of the Soil, Water, and Plant Testing Lab at Colorado State University. In fact, the water supplies in Colorado and New York are already similar, as they are both mountain-fed.
“A lot of the water [in New York City] is coming down from the Catskills to the city so that water should be fairly pure to start with,” Self says. “The pH is slightly more acidic, whereas Denver water tends to be more alkaline, but it’s not by much.”
Pollack isn’t alone in this quest. The Florida-based Original Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. chain, founded in 2008, bases its own recipes on similarly “reconstructed” New York-style water at its 19 US restaurants, all located far, far away from Brooklyn .
Still, Pollack insists there’s more to it than just science.
“It’s not just the water that makes a good bagel,” he says, “but it’s a number of things that have been done the same way for almost 200 years. You can take one of the processes out; you can take the water out, and keep everything else true to the tradition and still have a really awesome bagel. But if you take out the water, and the oven that they traditionally use, you’re not going to get the same bagel.”
